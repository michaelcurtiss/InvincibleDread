            <Text>Chapter 4 : Moteah
  
______________


	Mandrameen was a poet, and Seculla was a trial lawyer. It might seem that these two callings are as distant from each other as Man is from Woman, but according to Seculla, they were essentially the same - just like Man and Woman. A poet and a lawyer both peddle in the Truth and appeal to human nature.The poet crafts verse and hopes that it will sing when played on the human heart, and the lawyer does the same, just does it more bluntly, with less rhyming and more certainty. The only real difference is that people’s lives are at stake - that and the fact that the lawyer gets paid by the hour.
	Whenever Mandrameen would lay with Seculla, he’d tease her about this. He would say, with a great deal of comic exaggeration, that if a lawyer is just a poet working for money, then a lawyer is no better than a whore. Money cheapens Virtue. A whore cheapens Honor. A lawyer cheapens the Truth. 
Seculla would wave him off with her usual air of grace. She’d argue that there’s no such thing as the Truth. A single murder recounted by three different witnesses will result in three different stories. Unless there’s a bloody knife in hand, we’re all invincibly ignorant. Almost everything boils down to a he-said she-said, yet everyone picks a side. They choose who they want to believe and then invent a rationale for it later. At least a lawyer’s accounting of the Truth is put through trial and error; that alone is enough to make it more valuable than anything any poet has ever written. 
It is little wonder that the two disagreed on how Jeketian society should be structured. Mandrameen believed that all human beings have certain fundamental rights, and that the Law should emanate from these and protect them. Seculla would say that it didn’t matter what anyone thought the law should be, there’s only what it is - a practical thing, a subject to circumstance, politics, and power. She contended that no one has anything by natural right; you only have what you can take for yourself, and you’ll have it for as long as you can defend it. There are no noble laws written on the hearts of men; there is only the law of self-interest.
Perhaps if Seculla had been alive to see the dynamics within Ayram’s band, she might not have been so quick to doubt that Humanity has an intrinsic moral compass. Perhaps if Mandrameen had seen it, he might not have liked the direction that the compass' needle was pointing, for it didn’t point to Liberty or Virtue, it pointed to Ayram. He was a Law unto himself. Within his band there was no contest of wills, there were no practical concerns of property or freedom. Everything was Ayram’s. Not just whatever gold and wealth they found, but every mind, every body, every husband, child, and wife; it was all offered in submission - and that was the thing - Ayram hadn’t taken it, it was all willingly given. 
It was strange to Pyetle, but he could see the natural sense of it. Ayram was just that big. He seemed ageless. In the evening, at the golden hour, when they climbed out of the pit and headed south over rolling dunes to where the horses were hidden, Pyetle thought he could see Ayram’s shadow extending out to the horizon. There was room enough in it to fit all of them.
Moteah trudged up and down the dunes at Pyetles' side. She was his minder.
“The time’s come, Pyetle” she said as Pyetle paused to catch his breath. “We’re going out to the Sand. There ain’t no place there for outsiders, so, you need to make a decision.”
“A decision about what?” Pyetle asked.
“Are you with us?”
“Well, yes,” he said. “I’m here. I’m with you.”
“No, Pyetle. Being with us means being one of us. There ain’t much of a distinction there, but - We don’t take on passengers.”
“You’re telling me to pull my weight.”
“Kind of. I don’t know why Ayram brought you here. You ain’t no killer, and you too old to learn. You don’t offer to help with anything, so you can’t be a roper.”
“A roper?”
Moteah nodded. “A roper. It’s what I call it. I’m a roper. We tie the group together, keep things running smooth.”
“Ah.”
“Every now and then, someone tries to run, and I rope them down.”
“You don’t need to threaten me. I’m not going to run anywhere.” 
Moteah laughed. “It’s a figure of speech, Pyetle. Can I call you Pye?”
Pyetle shrugged.
“Alright, Pye. What I mean is, sometimes some people forget what we doin it for, or they get sad, lonely, or just sick of it - the Sand ain’t a fun place to be - and that’s when I step in with my sunny disposition.” She looked at Pyetle and put on a big smile. Pyetle couldn’t help but smile back.
“You’re in charge of morale?” Pyetle asked.
“I ain’t in charge of nothing. I do what I can for people cause I want to. You have to want to do it.”
“You don’t think I’m that kind of person?”
“Obviously. That’s why I’m talkin to ya. If you ain’t good in a fight, then you need to be good out of it. So Pye, what good are ya?”
“Well… I know bean-curd.”
“Bean-curd?”
“Bean products, but mostly bean curd.”
“You a cook?”
“No. It’s more the buying and selling of it. I would buy soy-bean in bulk from farmers out in -”
“You a middle-man?”
Pyetle nodded. “It’s not as simple as that, but...I guess it doesn’t matter. Not many beans out here.”
Moteah laughed. “Not much buyin or sellin either.”
“I guess I could help out with whatever you need help with.”
Moteah shook her head. “Nah. We’ll find somethin. Ayram put you here, Pye. I learnt a long time ago that he knows best. But still, you need to make a decision to buy in - not just ‘cause we don’t tolerate outsiders. It’s for your own safety.”
“Safety from what?”
“There be things in the Sand that only Ayram can save you from. He won’t save you if you haven’t taken the oath.”
“And what does that involve?”
“It ain’t nothin serious. Well, it’s serious, but I mean, it ain’t nothin too painful.”
“Too painful?”
“It’s a blood oath, Pye. There’s gonna to be blood.”
Pyetle grimaced. “I don’t suppose I have a choice?”
“Oh, we’d kill you if you say no. But you shouldn’t take the oath just because you don’t want us to kill you.”
Pyetle laughed.
“What?” Moteah asked. “You’ve got to be doing it for the right reasons.”
“What reasons are those?”
Moteah shrugged. “It’s different for everyone.”
“Why did you join up?”
“Nah. That’s between me and Ayram.”
“So I either take the oath, or you kill me. That just doesn’t seem like… Well, let’s say I took the oath, but I just said the words without meaning them.”
“There’s no words.”
“Well, ok.... Let’s say I just went through the motions.”
“It ain’t that kind of oath. It’s more… how should I say it… It’s more primitive. Maybe oath ain’t the right word.” Moteah stood up. “You got until we reach them hills over there.” She pointed ahead to the tall foothills of the Junei Mountains. At their pace, they’d reach them by nightfall.
“Is that where the horses are?” Pyetle asked, eager to get in a saddle.
Moteah nodded. “Just about.”
“Well I can already tell you,” Pyetle said as he stood up. “I’m in.”
“Alright.”
Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
	“The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Urghiz is a long way off.”
“Yeah.”
	“He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.”

            <Text>He came out of the shadows. 
Pyetle was dismayed to see that even the light wouldn’t show his assailaint, for the man was wrapped in black soccr cloth from head to toe. No hint skin showing, just cotton cloth, like a stuffed doll. No armor either. Not even a belt or bag tied to the waist. Rags tied off with thinner ribbons, and that was enough to define the form of a man.
Pyetle peered into the hood, and was dismayed to see that covering his face was a black veil.

The fellow was skinny, but the chest and arms were thick enough to make him am man he moved - center of balance in the chest, 

The Human being is not designed for contentment. It is designed to be unsatisfied. Cruel irony of the gods is that they gave the gift of imagination, and with it you imagine only how your life can be better. This drives you to seek better life, better position, more sustenance. That’s what’s driven them to this! Consorting with demons!

Throne room once carved into the earth like petra. But a great slab, tectonic plate, had shifted, so the whole room sat at angle, the lower right corner forming a gutter in which all manner of debris collected. So there was a flat path along it. Straight to the end of the hall, where a scaffold of stick and brick climbed up the far wall to an angled doorway.
Colmuns which once held the roof had tumbled down and blocked the way. Passages were carved through them. Strangely well kept. Ayram knew the way.
What is this place?
Dark, damp, chittering bats and creatures unspeakable. Odor? Cold Spring water.
At the end there’s a set of stairs, which set sidways was a jagged wall. 
“This was the throne room of an old, old kingdom. A kingdom which once ruled over all of mankind.

Ayram blows himself up to save the lives of the Ayramun from the cannibals.
Then they’re chased by empire, Ayram, in his flayed state, saves them again, but at great cost to himself.
Ayram goes into a chamber, or passes out. He’s muscle and sinew. Having just saved the lives the lives of teh Ayramun.
Pella sits the survivors down and is like, look. Ayram needs one you to donate.

Ayram is dying. Commands pyetle to go through the door and fill this jar with blood. 
Pyetle is like, the fuck?
Ayram shouts, go!
Green mist coming up through a crack in the floor. Same green mist that had pyetle intoxicated. Inhaled by the giant in the rock.
Head as wide as pyetle’s shoulders. Unkempt hair and beard. Head lolling back. Exposed neck. Pulsing veins. Pyelte and mazyd venture in. What should I do? Better do what ayram asks. 
Pyetle makes a cut on the shoulder, a little blood trickles out, but the wound closes and is healed.
Interesting. Cut deeper.

            <Title>Marx</Title>
            <Text>Marx seems to have been fairly convinced of the Civil War's importance from its beginning -- writing to Engels in support of John Brown's rebellion in a letter of January 1861 (&quot;In my opinion, the biggest things that are happening in the world today are... the movement of the slaves in America started by the death of John Brown&quot; -- his other pick, for reference, was the action of Russian serfs)1.
As for the war itself, our most telling early source is his 11th October 1861 article in the New York Tribune. In Marx's view, he sees the Civil War as being purely one of Southern aggression against the North:
&quot;It ought to be remembered that it was not the North, but the South, which undertook this war; the former acting only on the defense... the North, after long hesitations, and an exhibition of forbearance unknown in the annals of European history, drew at last the sword...&quot;2
The more pressing concern for Marx, who saw South-as-aggressor as self-evident, was in speaking against much public opinion in the British establishment of the time. Britain was keen to maintain trade with the Confederacy (evidenced later in the war by British blockade-runners attempting to sneak past the anaconda). British opinion at the time was anti-slavery, in line with the British Empire's policy, but at the same time its economic interests were high priority. Marx spends much of his 11th October article railing against London papers -- particularly the Economist and Examiner for being &quot;anti-Northern&quot; as he puts it.
Marx was firm in his belief that the war was primarily one of slavery versus anti-slavery, and spoke out against perceived Confederate bias in the British press.
As a side-note, Marx's views are not necessarily representative of left-wing British thought on the subject. Famously, the left-wing newspaper The Manchester Guardian argued against the Union embargo, saying that its continuation was causing destitution and starvation amongst the now-redundant working class of Northern England's cloth mills; 60% of the labour force of Greater Manchester's mills had been made redundant because of the lack of Southern primary goods3. That said, a strong labour front within Manchester did meet at the Free Trade Hall in 1862, pledging support to Lincoln against the institution of slavery.
Liverpool's dockhands and workers, who relied on the South for its economy (importing up to three-quarters of all Dixie's cotton in 1860), were both very left-wing and very supportive of the Confederacy -- &quot;it was said that there were more Confederate flags flying along the banks of the Mersey than in Virginia&quot;4.
On a more &quot;intellectual left&quot; side, the European focus on &quot;wage slavery&quot; made an impact on the debate on this side of the Atlantic. This is perhaps most evident in William Thomson, a Scottish weaver who travelled the US and Canada during the 1840s to see the state of labour on both sides of the Atlantic and bring home fresh ideas for helping the working men of his own country5. While he discussed the reality of slavery, including its harshness -- he mentions the execution of one slave for murder, where the slaves of his plantation and all neighbouring farms and plantations were called out to witness (and indeed assist) -- he praised the elements of the system which he saw as preferable to the &quot;wage slavery&quot; of Scotland at the time. He best summarises this thus:
&quot;Truth, then, compels me to say that the planters in general treat their slaves with great humanity. Would to God the aristocracy or the government of [Great Britain] would interest themselves half as much to improve the physical condition of the factory slave of England!&quot;
Thomson would go on to discuss his conversations with planters, and conclude that &quot;some of the more moderate and reasonable did not pretend to defend slavery... How are they to get clear of it? No practicable plan has been proposed to them.&quot; For Thomson and those in his vein of left-wing thought, the benefits of having homes, food and medical care provided to slaves did a lot to mitigate the institution in their eyes6. To what extent the &quot;wage slavery is worse than chattel slavery in some ways&quot; argument held sway in popular sentiment amongst Liverpool's trade unions is debatable -- it seems more likely to have been in response to worsening local living conditions -- but it's worth knowing that a strand of British leftism was much more positive about the South than Marx.
In short Marx was engaged with London establishment debates around the Civil War, and dedicated to pushing the idea of Southern aggression as the dominant narrative of the war. Some work has claimed that he and Engels saw this as a class-revolution-by-proxy7; this is somewhat supported by evidence. But Marx's views were only one of many within left-wing British thought of the period, and placing him within that context of differing views probably offers more fertile ground for discussion than simply answering &quot;what did he say about this?&quot;.

            <Text>Seb waved a hand over Mandri’s sightless eyes. The boy was catatonic, his limbs limp on the cold stone floor.
Seb leaned over Mandri’s face. He could see Mandri’s pupils flicker as the boy fell deeper and deeper into the trance of the God’s Eye burgeon. 
What sights was the boy seeing?
Seb had taken God’s Eye several times before, but he could never recall precisely what had he had seen. There was only the sense that his soul had blossomed and then burst into a shower of euphoria. Then, coming down, there was a lingering memory of a feeling of having brushed up against omniscience. It was knowledge, complete knowledge, sight of the Divine Plan extending out into the future and the into the past.
Then it was back to normal. Always back to normal. He didn’t like God’s Eye burgeons because of that. It was like giving a beggar a Lord’s feast and the kicking him out on street again. Seb thought it was better to starve. Get a taste of enlightenment and then be robbed of it is no good.
It sets up expectations, and that does more harm than good.
Expectations ruin everything.
Seb folded Mandri’s arms over his heaving chest so that the boy didn’t look so much like he was dead. That actually ended up making Mandri look more like a corpse, arms crossed over his heart like that, so Seb undid the arms and sighed.
Cross the arms? Or, don’t cross the arms?
There was no practical concern either way, but for Seb, this was indicative of a deeper problem. It was just very hard to know what the right thing to do was. Ostensibly, whatever ended up happening was always supposed to happen.
What he wants, is what he is supposed to want.
What he does, is what he is supposed to do.
A human being is little more than a rock dropped in air - the rock will fall because that’s what rocks do. They can’t decide to sprout wings and fly off in some other direction.
If Mandri’s arms were crossed, then they were always supposed to be crossed. If not, then not. Either way it would be a fulfillment of the grand design.
What bothered Seb about all that, was that if it were true (and he knew it was true), then it should stand to reason that he could do nothing - never speak, never move, never feel - and that, too, would fulfill of the creator’s design.
It was a damned if he did, damned if he didn’t kind of situation. There was no room in it for his own will. He knew there wasn’t supposed to room for it, that the illusion of will, the illusion of the self was a perversity of the Spark. Humanity was created to be at odds with it’s own self. That’s the great irony of human nature, that the very function of our minds precludes the possibility of actually understanding what is going on. Understanding is itself a misunderstanding.
Seb took a deep breath.
He thought about licking the sliced burgeon.
Just one lick. Maybe one drop on the tip of the tongue.
He knew he shouldn’t, because Pell would be here soon.
But what if did?
If he did, then that’s what was supposed to happen.
Pell couldn’t be mad about that.
She would be mad, but she shouldn’t be.
Then again, if she were mad, then that’s what was supposed to happen. And he couldn’t be mad about that. Unless he did get mad.
Seb sighed again.
He leaned back in his chair as far as he could lean, and he closed his eyes and tried to empty his thoughts. Be nothing, like a rock is nothing. Think about nothing - don’t think about nothing, have no thoughts. For him, that was a difficult thing to do.
And no - for Schisol’s sake - no expectations. 
He began to hum. Humming helped to push the threat of thought into the mind’s crowded periphery.
“MMMMmmmmmmm…”
“MMMmmmmm…”
“MMMMMmmmmm…”
Seb stayed that way in front of the fire, humming like a . almost as lost in the of nothingness as Mandri was, and just as he began to nod asleep, an old woman’s voice echoed into the cave and sent a chill down his spine.
“My beautiful Seb,” the voice said. “What are you thinking about?”
Seb twisted around in his chair. It was the Lady Pell. She was standing in the slit of rock which led down into the earth, and she was wearing her , a black curtain of a robe and which framed her face, a face austere and yet to Seb it was love.
“Well?” she asked. “What has so enthralled the mind of my Seb?”
 “Nothing,” Seb said. He jumped out of his chair and cast himself down at her feet. His forehead bumped on the rock. “I wasn’t thinking of anything.”
“Mm-hmm.”
Pell’s voice had way of benevolence, even when she was .
“And I see you’ve found young Mandrameen.”
“Yes.”
“I’m surprised to see that the Spark has chosen him. You should have seen the boy’s face when I swallowed his Ox’s spark. ”
She stepped towards Seb, silent as wind, and then her hand came to rest upon his shoulder. Her very touch , and all the tension in his body evaporated. He gasped.
“That’s better, isn’t it?” Her soothing voice.
Then she walked over to where Mandri lay. Seb could not see her, but he knew her gaze was studying the boy and he grew jealous.
“I found him dead in the Junei hills,” he said.
“I know you did,” said Pell.
He said, “I have remained your faithful servant.”
Pell chuckled, then said his name with a doting swing, “Seb, Seb, Seb.”
Seb felt her fingers alight upon his back and begin to knead his muscle with a practiced care.
“My child,” she said, “It’s been too long.”
Seb shuddered under her touch. The way she weaved her hands on his back was hypnotic, as if the nerves in his and were being stroked with water.
Pell said, “Your faith warrants a boon. Ask and you shall receive.”
Seb bit his lip.
“I wish to be able to see as you see.”
Pell stopped with a sudden jerk, and the warmth that he’d been feeling completely disappeared.
“Why? You know that gift is not for you.”
Tears.
“I know, but…”
“Watch,” Pell said. “I want you to watch this.”
Seb squirmed around on all fours to face Pell’s voice. He opened his eyes, then lifted his head, and there, next to Mandri’s head, was Pell, kneeling. She wasn’t looking at the boy, she was looking at him, and her countenance was stern as stone. In her hand was a near empty vial of golden fluid.
The last few tears of Schisol.
“This is not for you,” she said, jiggling the vial. The viscous fluid inside hardly moved.
“Why him and not me?”
“Seb… Would you know what to do with it?”
Seb lowered his head again in reverence. Pell was right. She was always right, though that didn’t make him feel better. He wanted to smash his skull against the rock. He heard the pop of the vial’s cork, and then 
“When Schisol comes again,” Pell said, “You will have your chance. But until that day, you will have to settle for my blessing.”
Seb felt her lift his chin with a dainty finger, and he looked into eyes. Seb could see her true nature in those steely eyes, for her crone’s nose and aged skin belied an unfathomable beauty.
The truth was in her eyes.
The truth was in her kiss.
The touch of her lips upon his skin filled him with amazement, for she had implanted there a warmth that spread through him like a wave, a pulsing wave which  until every single inch of him was enveloped in a warm embrace.
What she chased out was loneliness, undid the knot in his stomach that wouldn’t digest, purged the anxieties that ripped at his chest. Only her kiss could do this. Only Schisol, through her, could cure it - but only for the briefest moment, an exalted breath, the loneliness which ate at his heart was gone, and his eyes welled up with tears of wonder. 
“Feel better?”
“Yes.”
She removed her finger from his chin and so the spell was broken.
Then Seb returned his head to the floor where it belonged, and the chill of the stone set his skin to tingling, and all the same-old Seb flooded in. He would weep if it weren’t for her presence.
 He heard her sit down in the chair, the fabric squeaking tight against wooden frame.
“Now,” she said. “Tell me what the Ayramun are up to.”
“They’ve captured the Mazyd.”
“Yes.”
“They still plan to use him to kill Solraheen, though they cannot fully control the Mazyd’s breath.”
“Nor will they. Unless that bitch Elrahet grows a spine.”
“Ayram seems confident that the Purl will gain control.”
“Ayram is a dolt. What does Elrahet think?”
“I believe she thinks it can be done. But their first concern is getting to Jeket alive. The Hrks have these abominations called Mazydariga which can hunt a Mazyd to the ends of the earth. These Riga are children… it’s horrible. Deformed. They have a special sense for the Mazyd, as if they can smell the creature from across the desert. Ayram aims to capture one of these Rigas, so as to, somehow, hide his own Mazyd from Hrkan sight.”
“How would that work?”
“My Lady, the works of witchery are beyond my sight.”
As the fire crackled. Crossed leg bobbing up and down.
“I think it’s best, if we just don’t let the Mazyd get to Jeket.”
“I don’t understand.”
“What don’t you understand?”
“My Lady… Don’t we want them to kill Solraheen? Wouldn’t it set the stage for Schisol’s return?”
“It would, but that’s not what Elrahet is doing.”
“I don’t understand.”
“Yes, you do. Think it through.”
Seb is like, uhhhhh….
“What is Solraheen doing, right now?”
“He is impaled under a shard of Fabled Black.”
“And why is he impaled by a shard of Fabled Black?”
“To prevent Schisol from escaping His body.”
“And why is Schisol in Solraheen’s body?”
“Because Solraheen is the only vessel that can contain Him.”
“Do you understand now?”
“But if…”
“Go on.”
“If they kill Solraheen, then Schisol is freed.”
“Crack a vat with hammer, and the beer pours out. Destroy a vat with a Mazyd’s sunfire, and what happens to the beer?”
“They would destroy Solraheen just to destroy Schisol?”
“Hateful, isn’t it? Such is the bent the wayward Spark. People like Ayram and Elrahet hate more than they love. They aren’t really capable of love. You’ve seen it, haven’t you. How many Sparks have already been lost to fuel their infernal quest?”
“Too many.”
“Too many indeed. So, it is best if they don’t ever reach Jeket. It’s best if they never capture a Mazydariga. It’s best if they never make it to the bones of Ullr.”
“I see.”
“What I want you to do, Seb, is convince Ayram to change his plans. Have him head for the Goree Pass.”
“Why?”
“I’ve sowed Schisol’s word in the Goree Pass. There’ll be a tribe waiting there, and they shall be keen to deliver Ayram’s Spark back to where it belongs.”
“How do I convince him? The Goree Pass adds two days to the journey. And Ayram does not listen to me. He doesn’t even listen to Moto.”
“I can make the decision not so clear. The Ayram are pressed for time, as the Hrks are no doubt sprinting to the neck of gizol. If Ayram can’t make it there before them, with days to spare, then the Hrks will be nipping at his hells all the way to Ullr. And that is open ground. So if the Ayramun are delayed by a day or three, he will have to make a decision.”
“How am I to delay them?”
“I will do it. I will summon a storm. They will be forced to shelter here. All you need to do is plant the suggestion in Ayram’s thick skull. He’ll do it if he thinks it’s his idea.”
“Head to the Goree Pass.”
Pell nodded. “And perhaps make a little noise when you do it. The Kalemites are a distracted bunch, so it’s possible that even a sore thumb like Ayram could slip by them.”
“What of Mandrameen?”
“What of him?”
“Won’t the Kalemites kill him.”
“For the time being, he is immune to death. If he does die, he’ll just come back again.”
“What of me?”
“You are my eyes and ears, Seb. In all my life I’ve never had one such as you so close to the enemy.”
“Does the Kalemites of the Goree Pass know that?”
The question almost caught in Seb’s
“My child, are you afraid to die?”
She was looking at him. Seb knew she was looking at him by the way her voice carried to his ear, and he knew she could read ever quiver in his body and would know if he were lying. So, he told the truth.
“Yes,” he said. The word came out with a sob. Pathetic creature.
“Now, now,” Pell said. “Schisol has a plan for you. Think of it, you’ve already done more for Him than almost every other person who has ever lived. You are special. Should I say it again? You are special.”
“I don’t feel it.”
“But that’s what makes you special,” she said, brimming with earnest concern. “Your hatred for yourself is subtle righteousness. You’re one of the very few who know, without knowing it, that all of this is a mistake. That is why you are here at my side in these auspicious times. No one else would do. Few have the courage to walk your path, and only you could be here now. So give thanks, Seb. Be sanguine. You could have been one of the nameless number doomed to lie on the surface, a spare part, severed from the Whole.” 
Nothing Seb could say or do would , so he stayed low and prostrated himself further, then whispered a prayer to Schisol, thanking Him for His generosity.
Pell was contented to hear it.
“Now,” she said. “I have a storm to summon.”
She walked over to the cavern slit and whistled.
Something awoke in the darkness there,  Seb could hear an ominous thumping echoed into the room. Something creeping, creeping closer, then close enough that was swish of lizard’s tail dragging against rock.
A red-scaled snout pierced the veil of darkness near Pell’s hip, and it swayed from side to side, forked-tongue licking the air.
“Come on out,” Pell said with wondrous smile, as if she were talking to babe. 
The lizard’s bloody red head swung into the room. It’s narrow skull was nearly as long as Seb himself, and it’s slitted orange eyes were sunk behind a spiked ridge brow. Whatever teeth it had were hidden under long, labial scales, but Seb knew it’s teeth, they were short, sharp things that could be barely seen, for this was a Gummy-Biter, a man eater that could swallow him whole. Exceedingly rare, nearly hunted to extinction. The Old Jandri called them Sukalaw, meaning , because they could. 
The creature squeezed into the room with its characteristic short-armed shuffle. It was a juvenile, and the crook of its short-spined back came up to Pell’s shoulders.
She gave it a friendly pat, and the creature stopped beside her, nuzzled up against her body like a dog, and then it raised its neck for a good old scratch, which Pell was happy to provide.
Her fingers worked their magic and managed to coax a low hum growl of contentment. The lizard even closed its eyes. Seb thought he saw a smile. When they opened, it was looking at him, something akin to alarm, as if the creature had only now noticed Seb’s existence.
Seb slowly shuffled back against the wall.
Pell led the beast further into 
Its long tail still trailed into the darkness. 
“Lay down,” Pell said, and the lizard did as she commanded.


“Why are we doing this?”
“I’ve already told you.”
“No, that’s not what I mean.”
“Then say what you mean.”
“Couldn’t… Couldn’t we just do nothing at all, and everything would still happen as it should? Why do we need to fight Ayram? If we let him go, if we do nothing, Schisol will come all the same because that is what is supposed to happen. If you and I both died right now, Schisol would still come.”
“Seb…”
Pell’s shoulders sank and her eyes rolled in irritation as  belly of the beast in .
She asked, “Have you ever been to an amphitheater in Jeket?”
“No,” said Seb.
“Have you seen a play?”
“No.”
“Do you know what a play is?”
Seb nodded.
Then Pell said, “The actor’s lines are already written. In some cases, they were written more than a thousand years ago. Yet the actors still speak them. Like puppets, they speak them, and do you know why they do it?”
Seb shook his head slowly, hoping the drift of his chin would be a sign of contemplation.
“They do it,” Pell said, “Because that’s what they want to do.”
She paused to let the words sink in, and in case they didn’t, she added, “It really is that simple.”
She then stabbed the belly of the beast and thrust her arm into it, and the innards squelched as she felt around for the intestinal mucosa. Then she reached in with her bladed hand and began saw it away.
Seb was struck by how little blood there was. A beast that big should have enough blood in it to fill a Ayram’s bag. Then again, it was dead, and dead things don’t bleed all that quick.

I’m surprised to see that the Spark has chosen him —— replace with something morrrre. Idk. Allspark.

Pell says, “This is going to drain me.” So she doesn’t just keep killing lizards.


This path towards enlightenment can only be taken once. Savor it. No feeling you have will be as sweet as  this. Bittersweet - the best, most powerful, ineffible moments.
I wish I could take this journey again. Not know how it all works. Struggle. Nothing is a struggle when you see the path laid out before you. I could march right into the gates of hell and not feel so much as a goosebump.

            <Title>Art in Tudor period</Title>
            <Text>Art in tudors - didnt think of morality of art as we do. Making things is a craftsmanship. Works were judged by criteria that we don’t recognize today. How did they judge? Criterion: how important, how beautiful, is quite simply its costliness. Its cost is the most frequent thing commented on. Admiriation if expensive, or disparaging if something looked cheap.
Also - cunning - the skill with which something was made. Dagger - goblet - alabaster tomb chest
Third criteria - novelty. The hunger for novelty was intense - new decoration, manufacturing techniques, new objects.
Obssission with placement. One object next to another. A magnivicent display of gold plate, on a carved wooden buffet set in front of an inlaid tapestry.
Nobody talked about art. Nobody talked about styles. It was simply - objects with which the wealthy surrounded themselves.

When did wealthy go from functional objects to a decorative purpose.
Men and women who surrounded the monarch in their household
Household != court. Househould makes everything possible -meals activities, etc. Court is amorphous concept - the people who are around the monarch at any one time. But the people who ae besetting the king are ornaments to his power. The people who are the machinery who make the spectacle possible. The court = courtliness - manners and behaviors to which its members suscribe. Early medieval kings did not have this. They were surrounded by tough soldiers, men of action. But during the 14th century, these warbands gradually became more interested in the arts - tapestry, painting, poetry, - macho verison of these things gave way to artistic accomplishment. At the same time, women were brought into the court, softening this aggressive mix of people around the monarch. This all becomes a marked feature in the reign of richard II. 1377-1399. Royal court begins in his reign. His was a court that expresses an interest in culture. Comprises women to much greater extent than any previous court. It could portray itself magnificently. Had within it hierarchy. Richard loved crown, ceremony, clothes, rich food, famous portrait in westminster abbey.
The wilton diptych.
Henry 8
Obesssion with heraldry and coats of arms. Style guides for them. Painter and herald workshops were in adjacent houses.

LAWYER who has no friends. I just love disagreement.

I have invisible lines that not even I know. Cross it, and I’ll hate you forever.

Guy put to death for quartering the king’s arms.

New type of decoration in 1513 - the antique - any type of decoration that draws its inspiration from ancient rome. A new type known as grotesque work - late 15th cent
1490s  a group of intrepid painters break their ways into underground passages and caverns that made up the buried remains of the ‘golden house’ of the emporer nero. Until these explorers made their way into buried rooms, no one had seen decorated interior before. Painters like pentarichio found this wonderland. THey turned it into a new form of decorative interior. By 1500s became all the rage.

Then printing came int being.

“I have written a guide for those who have been burdened with wife and children, and those who have not traveled in life,” equivalent disadvanteges.

Heralding arms -&gt; discover italian art -&gt; explosion in ‘creativity’

Vasari, echoing Vitruvius, described the style as follows:[9]
&quot;Grotesques are a type of extremely licentious and absurd painting done by the ancients ... without any logic, so that a weight is attached to a thin thread which could not support it, a horse is given legs made of leaves, a man has crane's legs, with countless other impossible absurdities; and the bizarrer the painter's imagination, the higher he was rated&quot;.


Wool &gt; silk &gt; arras

Tapestry before painting = integrated with the architecture of the room. Dense taprestries lots of figures. Cost as much as a ship equipped with guns.
Stpaul - a story in nine seams, a rich weave laden with gold. Cost 3,000 pounds, or two warships.

English church split off - lower cultural trade with mainlaind europe. Grotesque gave way to strapwork.

In 16th century england, easel painting was not a prestigious form of craft.

Waves of iconoclasm which destroyed paintings and murals - trying to improve upon gods creation when it’s already perfect. Waves in 1520’30’s anotheir in the 40’s
Huge amounts of paintings in pre-reformation disappeared.

Now, every citizen’s wife that wears a taffitant kertle and a velvet hat must have portrait hanging int he hall.

Likeness often commissioned to celebrate an event in a person’s life.
Convey information about hte person - their status, the likes, ther profession, etc. Portraits can be ‘wrong’. Queen asks privy council to seek out bad portraits of herself and have them burned. So - produce an official likeness, then tax people to copy it.

No art, only what you can do for the patron.

Please the eye and serve the hand

Medieval christendom culture flowed without schism. Artists from all over europe in england.

Man who turned to sculpture so they can’t be burned (at least they’ll have to work at it.

The English word first appears in the 1560s as a noun borrowed from French, and comes originally from the Italian grottesca (literally &quot;of a cave&quot; from the Italian grotta, 'cave'; see grotto),[1] an extravagant style of ancient Roman decorative art rediscovered at Rome at the end of the fifteenth century and subsequently imitated. The word was first used of paintings found on the walls of basements of ruins in Rome that were called at that time le Grotte ('the caves').   These 'caves' were in fact rooms and corridors of the Domus Aurea, the unfinished palace complex started by Nero after the Great Fire of Rome in CE 64, which had become overgrown and buried, until they were broken into again, mostly from above. Spreading from Italian to the other European languages, the term was long used largely interchangeably with arabesque and moresque for types of decorative patterns using curving foliage elements.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information. (The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; placeholders will be replaced during compile with the information you provide in the Project Properties tab of Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings…, or you can delete them and enter whatever text you like.)
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Standard Manuscript Format” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the menu button next to it (this is already selected by default).
Click “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback Novel folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Paperback Novel” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected.
Click “Compile”.

To compile to e-book format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (This does not affect the cover image.)
If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to click “Cover” in the left sidebar and select the image from the “Cover Image” menu button.
From the “Compile for” menu button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
Click “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include.
Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Page size: The “Paperback Novel” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking the menu button beside “Paper Size” in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings. Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile dialog, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, select them and choose Format &gt; Formatting &gt; Preserve Formatting.
Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available in Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel” format; and “ADE E-book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in Adobe Digital Editions on Windows.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

Mandri goes out into the desert. 
Dies on the road.
Body found.
Brought to surgeon.
Cant do anything. Maybe elrahet.
Elrahet is like, not now.
	But what does it mean???
Elrahet is like, doesn’t mean shit.
They’re coming.
Stay out of sight. 

Surely he can’t see us from that distance.
The mazydei have eyes of a hawk.
Surely thats just rumor.


Arrow for ayram.
What if it doesn’t work?
It worked before.

Ambush happens.
Arrows flying.
Ayram knocks his arrow.
Doesnt work. 


Elrahet stabs nearby dude, uses bloodbomb. 
Yuge  midair explosion.
Shockwave.
Little pillar that is the mage’s body. Everything else is exploded.


Crater in the earth. Blows out the foot of the cliff.
Cliff falls down?

Runs down. 
The aftermath.

Body is different.
Got to get out of here.
What of the boy? 
Is his spark salvagable?
Bring him.

What about the boy?
Bring him.

Next chapter Mandrameen wakes up. 
Sees the five of them huddled around the body.
Hand burst out.
Incredible! Heart is a hand.
Watches them intently.

Moment of realization as they see he’s awake.
That’s gonna be one hell of a sight.

Then he wakes up in the cell with a prisoner.
Moment of realization as this prisoner is the person they were operating on.


If the nest is approached, the femal, like other towhees, dros straight to the ground and runs away in mouse-like fashion, probably as a distraction. 

The blackbird family is hard to characterize because it includes such diverse types, orioles, meadowlarks, grackles, cowbirds nad others. Most birds of this family have at least some black in the plumage, and their other colors run to warmer tones, such as yellow, brown, and orange. Sharply pointed bills. Most are more ore less omnivorous. 

Orioles in general are treetop birds, moving methodically through the foliage in search of insects, often stopping at flower sto add some nectar to their diet. =======AMBUSH

Mandrameen is artist shitter wandering the desert looking to die, running away from father abuse.

Brief meeting with Pyetle on the road who’s picked some east-slope mushrooms.

Mandrameen continues on. Dies down on the road.

Body discovered on the road by bandits as they’re setting up their ambush. They’re like, too big of a coincidence to be a coincidence.

Take the body up to Elrahet. Massages the boy back to life.

Decide to go through with ambush.

Ambush happens.
	-arrows fly, Elrahet casts blood bomb. Blows up Mage. Elrahet walks over to see mage with hand instead of a heart.

Problems:
	Recognition of Mandrameen as Salavan’s son.
	Decide to go through with the ambush despite the oddness.
	Introduction of Ayram. - needs to be epic. Ayram is off to the side meditating like an anime character.
	

PYETLE

Pyetle, former great artist, goes to kill Salavan Saran.
Tussle happens, Salavan gets the better of Pyetle.
Elrahet and Ayram show up and interrogate Salavan.
	- You lead us into a trap.
	- She wants to know wtf is this mage dude with a hand instead of a heart.
	- Salavan is like good, you killed him then. 
	- reveals hints of cult links, etc.
Elrahet, Ayram, and hill take pyetle and flee down into the underworld.
	-Salavan is shown to be a psychotic character. Gets pleasure from seeing Pyetle squeal. Need an interesting way for a hint of his groups plans to be revealed. 

Problems: 
	- the explicit goals of ‘Sol’s chosen’ - they set up the ambush because they want to draw Hrk into Jandria. How does that accelerate Hrk’s collapse?


SECULLA

Grain incident involving Seculla. She’s a tankie. Leader of the people. Kills grain dude.
	- ends on

Problems:
	How to transition from the grain incident to the secret society meeting.

Part ?:
Sol’s chosen meeting where Seculla learns that it was this group that had the man killed. She’s like wtf, why didn’t you tell me. 
Group is like, we didn’t tell you because we needed you blameless in case things went wrong. Now that it’s all worked out, we need to you to call for war. You’re the best at it.
OR - we want you to go to jail. Peer pressure. Maybe they threaten her.
Seculla gets the sense that they’re playing her. They don’t get that she’s a psychopath.

Problems:
	Related to way of white’s goals.

	Meeting of the Plenty. Man comes out, fingers Seculla. gets betrayed, called out by the fellow member of the way of white. Blamed for the disappearance of the mazydei. They think if Seculla is jailed or punished that will instigate the rebellion.

Problem: 
How to resolve this in a way that just doesn’t drop the whole ‘march of the people’ message, and also get her on the road.

BIG problem:
Need to get Seculla into jandri to free Sol.


Elrahet and Bandits Flee
Elrahet interrogates mazydei. Sees in him some capacity for great destruction. Perhaps the ability to destroy Sol. 
Elrahet has gained some manner of control over him.
In the pit cave, the mage hunter commandos pop up and are about to wipe them all out.

Problem:
Elrahet, obviously wants to see if boy can blow up the God.

            <Title>Lessons of History</Title>
            <Text>The first biological lesson of history is that life is compettition. Competition is not only the life of a trade, it is the trade of life - peaceful when food abounds, violent when the mouths outrun the food. Animals eat one another without qualm; civilized men consume one another by due process of law. Co-operation is real, and increases with social development, but mostly because it is a tool and form of compettiition; we co-operate in our group - our family, community , club, church, party, “race,” or nation - in order to strengthen our broup in its competition with other groups. Competing groups have the qualities of competing individuals: acquisitiveness, pugnacity, partisanship, pride. Our states, being ourselves multiplied, are what we are; they write our natures in bolder type, and do our good and evil on an elephantine scale. We are acquisitive, greedy, and pugnacious because our blood remembers millenniums through which our forebears had t ochase and fight and kill in order to survive, and had to eat to their gastric capacity for fear they should not soon capture another feast. War is a nation’s way of eating. It promotes co-operation because it is the ultimate form of competition. Until our states become members of a large and effectively protective group they will continue to act like individuals and families in the hunting stage.
The second bilogical lesson of history is that life is selection. In the competition for food or mates or power some organisms succeed aand some fail. In the struggle for existence some individuals are better equipped than others to meet the tests of survival. Since Nature has not read very carefully the american declaration of independece, we are all born unfree and unequal: subject to our physical and psychological heredity, and to the customs and traditions of our group; diversely endowed in health and strength, in metnal capacity and qualities of character. Nature loves difference as the necessary material of selection and evolution; identitcal twins differ in a hundred ways, and no two peas are alike. 
Inequality is not only natural and inborn, it grows with the complexity of civilization. Hereditary inequalities breed social and artifical inequalities; every invention or discovery is made or seized by the exceptional individual, and makes the strong stronger, the weak relatively weaker, than before. Economic developemnet specializes functions, differentiates abiliteis, and makes men unequally valuable to their group. If we knew our fellow men throoguhly we could select thrity percent whose combined ability woudl equal that of all the rest. Life and history do precisely that, with a sublime injustice reminiscent of calvin’s god.
Freedom and equality are sworn and everlasting enemies, and when one prevails the other dies. Leave men free, and their natural inequalities will multiply almost geometrically. To check the growth of inequality, liberty must be sacrifieced, as in russia after 1917. Even when repressed, inequality grows; only the man who is below the average in economic ability desires equality; those who are conscious of superior ability desire  freedom; and in the end superior ability has its way. Utopias of equality are biologically doomed, and the best that the amiable philosopher can hope for is an approximate equality of legal justice and educational opportunity. A society in which all potential abilities are allowed to develop and function will have a survival advantage in the competition of groups. 

The experience of the past leaves little doubt that every economic system must sooner or later rely upon some form of profit motive to stir individuals and groups to productivity. Substitutes like slavery, pllice supervision, or ideological enthusiasm prove too unproductive, too expensive, or too transient. Normally and generally men are judged by their ability to produce - excepting war, when they are ranked according to their ability to destroy.
Since practical ability differs from person to person, the majority of such abiliites, in nearly all societies, is gathered in a minority of men. The concentration of wealth is a natrual result of this concentration of ability, and regularly recurs in history. The rate of concentration varies with the ecnomic freedom permitted by morals and the laws. Despotism may for a time retard the concentration; democracy accelrates it. The relative equality of Americans before 1776 has been overwhelmed by a thousand forms of physical, mental, and economic differentiation, so that the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest is now greater than at any time since Imperial plutocratic Rome. In progressive societies the concentration may reach a point where the strength of number in the many poor rivals the strength  of ability in the few rich; then the unstable equilibrium generates a critical situation, which history has diversely met by legislation redistributing wealth or by revolution distributing poverty.
In the Athens of 594 BC, according to Plutarch, “the disparity of fortune between the rich and the poor had reached its height, so that the city seemed to be in a dangerous condition, and no other means for freeing it from distrubances… seemed possible but despotic power.” The poor, finding their status worsened with each year - the government in the hands of their masters, and the corrupt courts deciding every issue against them - began to talk of violent revolt. The rich, angry at the challenge to their property, prepared to defend themselves by force. Good sense prevailed; moderate elements secured the election of Solon, a businessman of aristocratic lineage, to sthe supreme archonship. He devaluated the currency, thereby easing the burden of all debtors (the he was himself a creditor); he reduced all personal debts, and ended imprisonment for debt; he canceled arrears for taxes and mortgage interest; he established a graduated incom tax that made the rich pay at a rate twelve times that required of the poor; he reorganized the courts on a more popular basis; and he arranged that the sons of those who had died in war for athens should be brought up and educated at the government’s expense. The rich protested that his measures were outright confiscation; the radicals complained that he had not redivided the land; but within a generation almost all agreed that his reforms had saved Athens from revolution.
The rooman senat, so famous for its wisdom, adopted an uncrompromsing course when the concentration of wealth approached an explosive point in Italy; the result was a hundred years of class and civil war. Tiberius Gracchus, an aristocrat elected as tribune of the people, proposed to redistribute land by limiting ownership to 333 acres per person, and alloting surplus land to the restive proletariat of the capital. The senate rejected his proposals as confiscatory. He appealed to the people, telling them, “you fight and die to give wealth and luxury to others; you are called the masters of the world, but there is not a foot of ground that you can call your own.” Contrary to Roman law, he campaigned for re-election as tribune; in an election day riot he was slain. His brother Caius, taking up his cause, failed to prevent a renewal of violence, and ordered his servant to kill him; the slave obeyed and then killed himself. Three thousand of Caius’ followers were put to death by Senatorial decree. Marius became the leader of plebs, but withdrew when the movement verged on revolution. Catiline, proposing to abolish all debts, organized a revolutionary army of “wretched paupers”; he was inundated by cicero’s angry eloquence, and died in battle against the state. Julius Caesar attempted a compromise, but was cut down by the patricians after five years of civil war. Mark Antony confused his support of Caesar’s policies with personal ambitions and romance; Octavius defeated him at Actium, and established the “Principate” that for 210 years maintained the Pax Romana between the classes as well as among the states within the Imperial frontiers.
After the breakdown of political order in the western roman empire, centuries of destitution were followed by the slow renewal and reconcentration of wealth, partly in teh hierarchy of the Catholic Church. In one aspect the reformation was a redistribution of this wealth by the reduction of German and English payments to the Roman Church, and by the secular appropriation of ecclesiastical poperty and revenues. The French Revolution attempted a violent redistribution of wealth by Jacqueris in the countryside and massacres in the cities, but the chif result was a transfer fo property and priveleg from the aristocracy to the bourgeoisie. The governmetn of the USA, followed Solon’s peaceful methods, and coomplished a moderate and pacifying redistribution; perhaps somene had studied history.  The upper classes cursed, complied, and resumed the concentration of wealth.

We conclude that the concentration of wealth is natrual and inevitable, and is periodically alleviated by violent or peacable partial redistribution. In this view all economic history is the slow heartbeat of the social organism, a vast systole and diastole of concentrating wealth and compulsive recirculation.

            <Title>The Sumerian World</Title>
            <Text>Third millenium sumerian world was a linguistically diverse group of people - sumerian&gt;semitic dialects.
Invention of a writing system that was flexible enough to represent simple commercial transactions, historical data, and abstract thought.

Complex irrigation systems using gravity feed, weirs, dams, and lifting devices to bring fertility to the area and hold back floods.

Some profession names are also generally thought to be pre-sumerian while the undoubtedly sumerian ones tend to be for more sophiticated urban-based professions such as that of scribe, suggesting that society was not very well developed before the sumerians.

It has also been suggested that the decimal system found in some of these very early texts is a pre-sumerian substrate survival.

Arguments have been made for their presence from the time of the earliest inhabitatns, based on the perceived continuity in the pottery style and of monumental architecture. 

Once the previously assumed link between specific groups of people, on one hand, and material culture, on the other, is broken, as it is by most scholars tody, the question fo the arrival of the sumerians becomes less significant because the culture concerned no longer has to be equated with the arrival of a single group.

The evidence we have for sumerian culture is incomplete, mediated by the twin accidents of discovery and survival. Also strongly skewed in favor of urban settlements and public buildings.

It is crucial to understand the dynamic interplay of water and sediments through rivers and marshes, levees and plains, lagoons and estuaries, and, finally, the esa. 

As the earth warmed, vast rivers fed by melting ice and heavy rains carved their way through the earlier sediments that had infilled the alluvial basin between the zagros mountains of iran and the arabian plateau. They dumped those sediments into the shatt al-arab valley, creating the floor of what is now the arab-persian gulf. Throughout the early holocene, even newer sediments then infilled those channel scours. For the most part, this re-leveled the basin floor. - in some places burying the earlier surface beneath tens of meteres of alluvial sands and silt;in others, leaving older remnants exposed, like turtles’ backs rising above the still waters of a pond. Over time, the interplay of tectonic uplift and subduction with rising and falling sea levels, rivers and floods, and windborne sand scouring its way across that silty plain shaped and reshaped optimal zones for a variety of biological activities.

Water drainage throught souther iraq is controlled by a great downwards flexure that results form slippage of the arabian plate beneath the upward-thrusting iranian zagros mountains.this silippage forms an unstable shelf upon which quaternary alluvial sediments were depositied. The topology of theis warped bedrock ultimately influences not only hydrology, but also sedimentation, marine incuriosn, marsh formation, and the likely hood of archaeological sites being preserved and visible at the surface.

While the entire mesopotamian zone tips slighlty from the northwest (at samarra) to the southeast (at basrah), its plane is also twisted northeast towardthe zagros as it is subducted below the great mass of those mountains. Between najaf and kut, it further twists west to east along an oblique fault zone…
The combined outflows (euphrates and tigris) passing southward, are slowed by the zubair sill, behind which fresh water tends to pond, and to which tidal action extends.

To the west, the alluvial shelf is defined by an abrupt rise in elevation of 10-20 meteres to a miocene limestone plateau, punctuated by small step faults that are most easily visible on the surface at Hit. During wetter periods and seasons, those faults funnel intermittent streams falling from the plateau, creating sediment fans below their nick points, as is clearly visible for the wadi al-khar near HIt. The most dramatic of these fans is that of the plio-pleistocen wadi badtin fluvial cone. During drier seasons, windborne sand pours down from teh plateau, forming dune fields that are pushed southeastward ahead of prevailing winds.
The mosopotamian zone’s eastern boundary is sharply demarcated by the folded uplands of the zagros piedmont. Piedmont sediments, carried downstream during pluvial periods, have deeply buried that boundary in a series of merged alluvial fans that tend to push tigris waters sowthward from the southeast-trending flow. Thus, as the shatt al-arab crests the ubair sill en route to the gulf, it passes through a sediment framed bottleneck, where much mixing, scouring and re-leveling of sediment occurs during river floods and marien incursions.

Understanding the deep structural effects of this twisted bedrock on hydrology and sediment deposition is fundamentalto understanding the processess of the twin rivers metamorphoses through time. From the eight millennium bc, at their point of emergence onto the alluvium, the tigris and euphrates appear always to have had anastomosing and significantly intermingled flows.

As the surface slope of alluvial channels levels off - either because the land itself levels or because their channels empty into a large body of water - river beds undergo threshold changes from braided, to meandering, to straight or sinuous with the latter in some cases assuming multi-channel, anastomosed patterns. Thus, in mesopotamia, braided channels are typical of the arid uplands, where the tigris and euphrates are deeply incised into the syrian and arabian plateaus, however, on dropping from thos stable shelf lands into the alluvium, the slope abruptly diminshes to less than 1 percent. There the rivers assume meandering courses through the river floodplain, within fairly stable banks. 

Most sediments are dropped in flood deposits along river distributaries, over time building broad, weak levees.
Because alluvial soils comprise the best-drained agricultureal soils, direct association of htese levees with past agricultural activity is common.

Finally, as rivers abruptly slow on encountering slack water, they dump their remaining sediment loads, resulting in the multiple, bifurcating channels of a ‘bird’s foot’ delta, with newly deposited sedimetns becoming webs of marshland between the toes. 

Channel flipping as distributaries become blocked by their own sediments.

The ocean’s rise and fall is most significant in it’s see-saw effecto n the river’s deboudhmetn into the gulf. When the ocean levels drop, the rivers’ gradients increase and their water flow speeds up, leading to upstream downcutting, and downstream sediment dumping., that rapidly builds out (progrades) the rivers’ alluvial fans. When sea levels stabilize head-to-tail slope levels off and the rivers slow. As they do, more sediment accumulates within their floodplains, along their levees, and across their existing deltas, creating ideal conditions for formation of freshwater marshlands and brackish estuaries.


The aeolian deflation of later river and canal levees, which formed dune fields that then scoured their way across  the plain. In some cases, this destroyed archaeological sites entirely. In others, it barely scraped the top of hte surface ,revealing more recent material, but leaving hte older foundations buried. In still others, it buried sites utterly - or, alternatively , left archaeological features pedestaled above the deflated surface, standing on columns of sediments protected from deflation by archaological debris.

The thin black line of the shatt al-khar canal is all that remains to indicate that a onece- mighty watercourse - a channel teh size of one of the marsh-feeding tigris distributaries south of amara - once flowed here.

A ganglion of canals.

Southern part of the mesopotamian plains make up the lad of sumer have been subdivided into four broad soil ones 

- floodplain of the tigris and the euphrates rivers wher the sinuous or anastomosing rivers usually flow on low levees with levee slopes ideal for gravity flow irrigation. They include floodplains where water tables are higher an salinisation can be a chronic problem.
- the delta plain of the tigris and euphrates where the rivers are PRONE to branch into a network of channel. Here drainage is slow, water tables are high, many soils have a tendency to be waterlogged, and flood basins are often coverd by water or marsh.
- marsh region where rivers are virtually lost in reed-fringed extensive shallow marshes where groundwater is always high.
-the estuarine zone - here the tidal effect of the gulf is felt so that the rises and falls of water level contribute to both irrigation and drainage.

The most obvious, but profoundly deceptive, feature of the lower mesopotamian plains is that they appear almost flat. Even minor differneces of elevation can make a significant difference to the flow of water. The gradient is only 5-10 cm per km in places, but is sufficient for the river to flow and to discharge that flow into the gulf. Channels in the lower plain have a tendency towards straightness.
Flow on slightly raised levees raised up a few meters high that result from the preferential deposition of sands and silts closer to the trunk channels, and finer clays further away. 

Rivers would occasionally burst their banks and adopt new channels, a process known as avulsion. These were catastrophic events, could lead to entire sttlement systems being left without water, but could have created new channels and new opportunities for settlement.

Drains rather than canals

After water was conducted along canals, it was necessary to get this water into secondary, tertiary and smaller channels, ultimately into fields. This was probably effected by using either regulators or weirs. Canal regulator excavated by Parrot at Tello, ancient Girsu. Constructed of baked bricks and bitumen, this feature appears to have taken a large volume of water and funnelled it through a narrow bick built channel which would have constrained flow to a given discharge after which the water then flowed into a widening funnel, presumably back into another channel.

Dams or weirs constructed of reeds, palm trunks and mud, raise and divert flow into subordinate channels.

Economies of scale were more efficient due to larger areas of fallow allowing for larger herds.

Little support for the notion tha the need to irrigate large systems ctually created the state. Instead, shorter canals leading from the main channels could have been readily organised by sumerian communites in the same was as recnt kin-based social systems in souther iraq. There is also no reason why the state should have controlled everything because in modern systems both state controlled administration (upstream) and independent or privately owned systems (downstream) coexist.

Sumerian language
-then follows an account of the language: its sounds, its words, how those words combine to form phrases, and how those phrases combine in turn as clauses.

A language can be classified in two independent ways: ypologically in terms of its grammatical features, and genetically in terms of the languages to which it is related. 
Smerian is typologically an agglutinative, ergative, and verb-fial language, genetically unrelated to any other.

Agglutination - word structure, morphology
Words can be described as consisting of at least one morpheme (minimal grammatical unit), which is called a free morpheme or base and can itself function as a word (such as the verb run). Words can also include one or more bound morphemes (such as the s in runs). Most langages use a combination of different morphological strategies but favor one more than others. Sumerian favors agglutination: typically it forms complex words by ‘gluing’ a a seqence of single-function, easily identifiable morphemes to an unchanging, generally monosyllabic base. The immediate contrast is with fusional morphology, as in languags ssuch as latin that fovor instead base-alterations and multifunctional bound morphemes with boundaries that are less easy to indetify.

Pg 96 - 2nd paragraph nominative-accusative vs. Ergative-absoltive. 

Subject - object -verb. The verb is the head or governing element in the clause, and verb-final languages tend to be head-final elsewhere. 

A problem that arrives in any attempt at classification - some scholars are splitters and some are bundlers.

Sumerian refers first and foremost to a language, not an ethnic group. 
The sumerians referred to themselves as ‘bleck headed people’ - sag gi ga - and called their homeland simply, ‘native land’ (ki-en-gi, native tounge land.) Kengi - place-native
The origin of the sumerians remains a mystery (either aliens, or you know, because they didn’t document this shit)



The earlists texts offer little historical information if one is interested in a hostory of events. Textual genres that we cnounter in early mesopotamia are admin texts, word or lexical lists, literary texts, royal inscriptions and legal documents.

Administrative texts are among the first text that we encounter after the invention of writing. These texts recorded economic processes and offer important sources for the study of socio-economic histories. 
Kings began naming every year after a special event of the preceding year. Among the events are military conflicts (concquest of cities), religios eentes (appointing high priestesses or fashioning prestigious object of worship)

The earliest literary texts did not appear ntil about six-hndred years after writing was invented. Most was concerned with religion, praising deities and temples. The bulk dates to the Old Babylonian period (c1800 bc) Royal correspondence of UR, and sumerian kinglist.





Nearly one hundred years ofUr 3 state is best documented period in all of ancient mesopotamia history. Almost no texts from earlier part of state domination. Roughly 83% of known ur3 tablets with a date are from a short period of 25 years.

Climactic changes, warming, less precipitation. Over a few hundred years, the annual floods that regularly covered large tracts of land in the south ewere  largely stemmed, leading to the gradual silting up of much of the swamps and marches that made up the estuary of the two rivers. New and fertile land became available for cultivation, while the decrease of violent spring floods made longterm settlements along the rivers possible. 

These people are obsessed with material conditions, and it is impossible to escape the conviction that irrigation agriculture or the comparative security, population density and stability, and social differentiation and complexity that induce - was at the very heart of these material conditions.

1.) necessity of strict adherence to fallow requirements
2.) need for extensive irrigation systems.
3.) volatile and shifting nature of the mesopotamian rivers and canals, which would obliterate any physical field boundaries.

The early mesopotamian concept of a royal dynasty was closely tied to the city that was its power base; this differs strongly from modern conceptions of royal dynasties, which are mainly defined through blood ties. - rarely information on parentage of kings, instead, ings stated that their rule was legitimised through divine favour.

Sumerian kinglist - skl created afiction that southern mesopotamia was always ruled by a single dynasty and therefore served as a tool of legitimisation for the old babylonian dynasty of isin, who laid claim to a hegemonic rule over mesopotamia. Differences in copies show that the old babylonian scribes took some liberties in transmitting the kinglist.

‘Like all territorial states of the third millennium, the ur III state was relatively fragile and centered on charismatic rulers, such as sargon, naram-sin, ur-namma, and sulgi.
Food shortage, sky rocketing food prices during the reign of ibbi-sin indicate the beginning collapse of the centralised administration.

When mapped regionally, settlements often occurred in linear arrays, on account of their close adherence to levees of the rivers and major canals. The tigris and euphrates dropped most of their suspended sediments in this upper part of the plain, resulting in the substantial aggradation of silts that have buried the earliest sites. Further southeast, anatamosing and branching patterns.

River diversions could be intentional acts of war that could leave citiesor entire regions suddenly without reliable water for irrigation, at which time they would have to be abandoned, or the watercourses restored with herculean effort.

The precise timing of the first urban growth remains a matter of debate. The urk period, defined archaeologically, covers almost the entire fourth millennium. Pg.138

Pearls-on-astring model of agricultural settlement, cities along river/canal


The age of city states and initial political unification (2600-2100 bc)

By the mid-third millenniu, the use of cuneiform writing had expanded byond administration to include propagandistic statements by rulers, occasionaly in the form of monuments that also feature ryoal and divine iconography. Each city was envisioned as the home of a god to which the fortunes of the city and its ruler were tied, and in whose name temples were built and wars were fought. The inter-city warfare described in these monuments has given rise to the notion f a landscape of city states, small autonomous polities based around a single major city.

If nucleation and endemic conflict were closely relate,dthe historicallyknown city states phase may have been an unsettled time, since so few communities felt secure enough to settle permanently in the countryside beyond city walls. The mid third millennium represents teh apex of urban nucleation, almost 80 percent clustered into centeral sumer. Simultaneous warfare and culeation characterized northerm esopotamia. 

Basiclly, period were settlement were more spread out, then nucleation as people got raided. - Elrahet longs for this brief period of time in which human liberty was absolute. You could be who you want and go where you want. Then the issues of security. 

City state model is just one of many possible political forms. The lagash state, for example, included girsu and nina, each a large city in its own right.

Whoever controls the headwaters controls the river - so the five kings instigated a shared settlement.

When major political and religious centers - palaces and temples = are located next to each other in the middle of a settlement, this indicates a concentration of both religious and political power; when separate, they likely have different spheres of influence.

Thus they embody the practical and symbolic separation between the religius and secular which is the hallmark o fmesopotamian rule from this time forth.

None of the early dynastic houses have staircases.

At both lagash and at khafajah, houses in very different parts of these cities have the same range of room widths, providing a strong suggestion that the physicla divisions between residentail areas occupied by people of different classes so prevalent in today’s cities did not exist in ancient mesopotamia.
Room widths differ consederably between cities.

At both abu salabikh and lagash, walls circumvallate the individual component mounds that make up the ancient city, but no single wall surrounds the whole.

Late early dynastic - high-density occupation with little in the way of open space. Houses built around courtyards and sharing party walls strung along quite narrow streets and alleyways, some with dog-leg bends in them.
Differences in density were limitations in space imposed by the presence of city walls. 

It was during this time that secular rule evolved. In some instances, residential structures were clearly connected to the main temple, such as houses with the temple oval at Khafajah. 
Southern Mesopotamia was never again as urbanized as it was during the late early dynastic period.

Cities settlements with populations too large for everyone to know each other and with an institutional complex unknown earlier wer first seen in sumer.

How to identify public building.
Architecturally unique, size, location, decoration and building materials and will. Exceptional forms means exceptional function.

Villages and towns developed into citeies, cities became centers of trade, cult centeres, and the seats of political power. Global trade developed, dynastic succession became the norm, rebels usurped power, and worldly kings proclaimed themselves gods.s

Tripartite floor plan - two parrallel rows of rooms with an open hall in between.

A square basic form, built of four wingsthat enclosed a huge courtyard. Square building. Unique in the history of uruk.  Other buildings were torn down, but not this one.

The builtorder can accordingly be read ass igns of the ruling order. Monumentality and an accumulation of monumental buildings signal unlimited availablity of resources and thus unliited power in the hands of those responsi le. 

The use of monumental architecture as a demonstration of power.  The opposite is the destruction of earlier monument. 

Brics built into the walls of the inner courtyard in which the ziggurat was the dominnant feature were inscribed with the sumerian name e-temen-ni-gur-ru - the foundation carries shiver

Royal propopganda promoted the view that kingship was the very basis of civilisation and that it was sared. It descended from heaven. Chosen by the gods, the king was their representative on earth. He formed the link between mundane and transcendent worlds. He feed the gods, establishing justice, and prevailing over wilderness and foreign enemies. A paragon of manliness, and through his link with the divine world he was god-like. In contrast to egypt, explicit self-deification with a royal cult was confined to two short periods during which mesopotamia was united under kings of akkad and the third dynasty of ur. 
Kings were men. The only female king in the sumerian kinglist, ku-baba of kish, is characterised as a brother keeper, obviously a mockery that bespeaks the attitude towards women in the male-dominated early mesopotamian establishment. 

Inscriptions on dedicatory objects and seals identify woen through their husband or father. Stereotypical gender roles existed at least since the mid-third millennium BC: in a birth incantation from Fara, the great midwife brings the girl to the world with a spindle and needle and the boy with two types of weapons.  Grave goods - men weapons, women jewellery. Men to the public, women to the domestic.
The fact that they figure as heads of estates in administrative texts should not seduce us into concluding that the organisation of the state was the product of a strategy impleented by women and women in which women were on par with male counterparts. 
Royal women formed part of the elite. Accordingly a man could, in exceptional cases, be identified through his affiliation with a royal woman rather than through his father. Elite status however, should not be confounded with direct political influence. Even if royal women had power behind the throne, they remained subservient to the establishment. Thus Enheduana prayed for her nephew Naramsin in order to regain her office of Nanna’s high priestess in Ur, from which she had been schased away by the rebelling local governor. 
Women were tools in political marriages to produce heirs.

In a recent study on Cyrus the Great of Persia, Amelie Kuhrt revealed the discrepancy between this king’s image and reality: rather than the liberator, the wise and tolerant statesman which he stylised himself as and which continues to dupe his audience today, he actually treated his enemies in much the same way as his imperial predecessors and successors.

In every communication, the circumstances - source, channel of transmission, receiver - are vital for understanding the message - there are diverse channels that transmit visual images of kings and queens: statues, stelae, door plaques, cult vessles and implements, foundation figurines, rock reliefs and cylinder seasl. 
Dedicator objects, especially royal statues, were ritually consecrated and could receive offerings. 

Most dedicatory objectes which have survived the tooth of time were carved in stone.
Both materials were precious in mesopotamia: metal was imported from anatolia or iran and, while limestone existed in north meso, most other stones were imported from farther away, the kings of akkad, for example, imported diorite from oman for the manufactor ofe size statues and stelae and the fact that they metnion this specifically in their inscriptions confirmsthe value that was attributed to the material. 

Two principles of compositionar the distinction between culminating and episodic scenes and the notion of core and expansion. Culminating scenes depict one group of figures at the climax of a series of events, while episodic scenes juxtapose successive episodes of a story; 

The uruk vase depicts the cosmos of the first urban society in hierarchic order over several registers to be read from bottom to top. Water as a precondition of the agrarian state, crop and animal husbandry, the labour force carrying the products of the economy, and in the culminating scene on top, the encounter of the ruler with the goddess inanna. Barley and flax, rams and ewes surplus harvest to storage.

Presentation scenes that render the prosperity that the gods bestow on the ruler by streams of water issuing from overflowing vessels that the enthroned deity offers to the approaching ruler. 

Since the king is invested in his office by the gods and performs his duties towards them, his authority to dispense justice is divinely sanctionned.

Kings were also expected to prevail over the wilderness. The Hunt Stela. Fighitng lions with a spear and bow. Heroic thing to subdue a wild animal.

Divine kingship was neither the apex of a long development towards a centralised mesopotamia, noran autonomous symbolic system, but a component of complex reformations that took place in teh aftermath ofalmost fatal state collapses. (michalowski 2008: 39)

The nature of a ritual of kingship known as the sacred marriage has long puzzled scholars. With one contested exceptio, the famed uruk vase from the rotoliterate period, the testimony has appeared to be exclusively textual. 

Between two deities or between a deity and a human. 
The present study begins, therefore, by setting aside the mega-category of ‘sacred marriage’ if the term is to be retained, it needs to be used mor judiciously, not as a category that encompasses every union conceivably possessing a sacral character but as a familiar name for a uniquely mesopotamian institution whose native referent has been hard to pin down, namely, the poorly understood relationship between mesopotamian rulers and the goddess inanna.

Uruk the first city, all about the temple. Then arhitecture of cities starts showing two new elements, a monumental building with a different layout from temples, first attested  at kish, and city-walls, first attested at uruk. They suggest that a non-religious source of authority had arisen, connected to warfar, which was perhaps on the increase because growing poppulations demanded greater hinterlands and fought over the agriculturalzones between the cities. The people reacted by seeking protection behind walls and military leadership. The person incharge demanded his own special residence, the palace. Army leaders aquired supreme powers. The earliest preserved documentation of a war, the conflict between the cities of umma nd lagash over border territory, which lasted several generations, shows how rulers gained prominence through victory in battle.



Middle of the third millennium did away with the parallel existence of two sources of power, secular and religious, and merged them into one. 
Urukagina’s reforms, already mentioned here as an edict to protect the people from abuse, claim that the king restored domains that since time-immemorial had been owned by the city ruler and his wife to the gods ningiru and bau.

The usurpation of divine powers did not stop there. The fourth king of the sargonic dynasty, naram-sin, became a living god himself. The official announcement of that transition is preerved; the incription on the Bassetki tati pleaded witht he various gods to make naram-sin a god as well. Naram-sin’s successor Sharkalisharri.

The ophidian snakes, wheich entowine down the length of the portal and point their heads at the spout, the water delivery system has been conceptualized as interconnected streams flowing between heaven and earth. 
The merger of symbolic liquids in some specific manner reversed the dominance of one stream over the other, flipping the existing current, sending moisture toward the fields during growing season, and directing water away during the harvest.

The clergy of sumer pg. 246

Cultic celebrants could lead rites in and outside various sacred spheres. 

Onesumerian poem describes the fashioning of the gala (‘lamentation priest’): Enki, god of wisdom, creates the gala and provides him with prayers, laments, and musical instruments to soothe the raging heart of the goddess Inana that was troubling heaven and earth. 
Another sumeriran tale, ‘enlil and namzitara’ recounts how the high god enlil disguised as a gcrow, meets manzitara, a servant of the gudu priests (‘cultic officiants’), going home after having completed his daily work.  Namzitara recognises and acknoledges the power of enlil, who rewards him by giving hima hereditary prebend (offices having the right to an income from the temple in return for the performance of services connected with the cult, a benefice) in his temple. 

Copious large temple institutions with sundry and numberous staff proliferated in the citie. The clergy who served them were divided into specific groups, each associted with a particular temple and god;. 

The apex of the sumerian clerical hierarchy was occupied by the en, whose gender generally depended on that of the deity. If the deity was female, the en was male, and vice versa. The en was considered the spouse of the deity and this metaphorical relationship expressed the harmony of the divine and human worlds in his/her person.

In the ordination ritual, as in any rite of passage, each phase has its typical symbolic expressions. The first phase is the separation from the profane world after the eselection of the en-priestess through divination.rites of preparation such as purifications and ablutions. After describng her divine election from birth for the office of the en and her physical purity, an essential requirement for the priesthood, the en-priestess enanedu alludes to some rite she performed as princess in front of the palace as she leaves it.

The second phase is the liminal period, the novitiate, in shice the novice is to learn the rituals that she will be clled upon to perform. Learns the principles of human society together with the divine ordinances, the ground plan of heaven and earth, the gishur. 

The third phase, the incorporation of the enpriestess into the the sacred world, is attested both in administrative and in literary texts. Administrative texts record disbursements made on the day or days of the celebration of the entrance of the priestess into the gipar, the place that will be her ecclesiastic residence. 

The celembration ceremonies began by the en priestess festively entering the city and leading a ten head of female livestock, one white cow adn nine black ewes. After having taken up residence in the city, the priestess entered the temple of Gula, the goddess of healing, where she remained for the first four days. On the fourth day, the en-priestess performed the ki-utu-rites, possibly at the rising of the sun, which involved invocations and sacrifices of male animals - a bull, ram and billy goat as the siskur  offerings. In all likelihood, these rites were designed to bring about the ritual purification of the new priestess.

Specific garmets, grades of wool and textile were reserved for oyal and temple personnel and public displays in ceremonies and feasts. People in lower echelons were provided with cloth of coarser varietes.

Cotton hemp and jut, but outside of reeds and palm, there are no records for the use of any other fibers in mesopotamia. Wool of sheep and from flax for linen.

‘In sumer, the shift to wool catalyzed ‘the initial development of large textile workshops and the labor class”’

Linen fiber is produced from the flax plant. 

Fabric and garmets made of linen were restricted to elite clothing and a vvariety of accessories.

When and where special breeds of sheep for wool were developed is less certain. Although spindle whorls were discovered in 7000bc, it is unclear whether they were for spinning linen or wool. 

By Ur III, textile production had become an industriral activity. Standardized qualities fo wool were established, earmarked for specific fabrics, adn recorded by weight .

Until shearing implements were invented, the wool was hand plucked from the animal. On a single day, 2,259 sheep were plucked, three month period, 203,310 sheep were plucked in Girsu alone.

Fat-tailed sheep were teh highest quality and ranked as first and second class, while highland mountain sheep er e third, fourth and fifth. 

Plain weave in chich long fringes of fleece were woven into the fabroc or a asheepskin worn with th efleece side down.

Men wear kilts with a long wool fringe. Over the kilt they wear a cape of either cloth or sheepskin and a helmet of similar materias. The cape has a neck clasp and holes perforating the cloth at intervals. 

Sashes became more elaborate. For men, they were worn at the hip, loins, and waist, as shawls, and as a kind of undershirt. Could be worn with a wrap around cloak. 

Most fabrics were produced in a balanced weave in which the ratio of warp to weft was equal(vertical threads to hori threads) .

Cleaning the wool, combing it, teasing it by hand, then rolling and stretching the fiber,
Flax - plant needs to be soaked, beaten and xcraped, then combed out. Much more difficult

After preparing and cleaning the wool, the next step is to spin it into yarn suitable for weaving. The purpose of spinning is to convert a massive quantity of fiber into a stable yarn. This is usually done with a spindle consisting of a shaft and a whorl with a perforation near its center. Spindle whorls stretch back to neolithic.
The spinner holds the spindle with one hand while drawing and twisting the fibers with the other. This twisting process presses the fiber together and strengthens the thread.
A round object with a centrally pierced hole is more likely to be a whorl than a bead.

Whorl typologies based onweight, diameter, and perforation at the center. Whorl diamter determines the quality of the yarn spun, since a whorl with a smaller diamtere spins faster and produces a tightle spun yarn.

Imports alone motivated trade, never exports. In south mesopotamia, true trade was focused on the importation of the raw materials which the region lacked, notably metals, high quality timber and both building and semi-precious stones. 
Such materials were acquired in exchange for manufactured goods, ainly textiles, foodstuffs and oils. Cerals do not seem to have played a major role, probably, because of the difficulty of transporting such bulky items by land.

Moto is just there, sword drawn.
Moto kicks sand. Sprays up high. Blnds. Ducks, twirls swipes.
If either hit. 
Shade reluctantly impressed.
“You demon!” it said.
“Look at you!” said Moto.
The Shade laughed. “Self-taught? You mean to say that you’ve.”
“I’ll teach you something, if you’re willing.”

Moto, calmly grasps his scabbard. Adopts a different stance. Mandri there was a fight within the fight that his untrained eyes could not see. The Shade seemed quite amused with it all. Whatever Moto was doing amused him, and out of habit the Shade tried to find a sympathetic eye to share in the absurdity, but all there was was Mandri, so the Shade. Then he walked towards Moto, the most casual stroll, like he was out to buy some lunch.
Goes in a goes for it. 
Zing zing swish
Moto rushed to his feet, keeping the tip of his sword trained on the Shade’s .
“Incredible,” said the Shade.
“Feeling scared?”
“Why would I?”
“I cut you.”
“No you didn’t.”
“I know what a blade slicing bone feels like.”
Shade looks down at his robe, and . He stuck his gloved fingers into it and probed the .
“You cut my horn. And even then you barely scratched it”
Shock fear in his eyes.
“Oh shit.”


You smell like a mazyd.
Where is he.


The stone made a funny noise wherever it landed; a kind of delayed echo. It didn’t bother Moteah, but Pyetle was intrigued - there seemed to be another pit. He walked over to check it out, and sure enough, a deep and wide hole opened up into the ground. Another pit cave. No one was in this one, and it didn’t seem to open up into the Underworld. It was just a big hole in the ground, unconnected to anything but the outside air. 
It got Pyetle to wondering just where he was. In the Sand there is a place called the Pitted Portion, a place filled with sinks and holes and caves, but that was a thousand leagues from Dissel, and he couldn’t have made that journey in just one night.
Just to be sure, Pyetle scrambled up a little graveled hill and climbed atop a boulder to get a better view of the place. He expected to see something familiar, like the Blackshell hills or the . The Blackshells were indeed there to the east, but only their peaks, so far away that their white tips barely gleamed through the thick haze of distance. 
The rocky ground all around wasn’t clay, it was rock. Thickly pitted for miles. Most pits weren’t so dramatic as the one he’d come out of, as most edges were sloped and sagged or cratered instead of dropping sheer into the earth. In between these holes there were wide, flat spaces of dry sandstone, but there were also great mounds of boulders and gravel, just like the one he was standing on. Undoubtedly , this was the Pitted Portion. 
No one knew how these pits came to be. There was no river running through it, nothing to carve a winding canyon. It was just like the rest of the Junei plain, only with holes and the rubble that had, presumably, once filled them. Standing there, Pyetle felt certain in Truth of the Solean Myth of Damdromidon - what else but a great demon looking for the buried heart of the earth could explain this cavernous plain?
— When Pyetle had looked at maps to trace the route had taken, he’d come to expect a clear delination between portions. Pitted is here and windy is there. But looking out he wondered if the pitted portion ever ended, if the names given were even useful. If the different parts of the sand were even clear enough to warrant a category, or if it was one big clusterfuck.
Then a voice shouted from the base of his little promontory.
“Pyetle! What are you doing?”
Pyetle turned in fright and saw Ayram standing there, looming large even though he was a good thirty meters away.
“Just taking a look!” Pyetle shouted back. “Is this really the Pitted Portion?”
“Did Moteah not make it clear to you that there are Imps about, looking for us?” Ayram asked.
Pyetle took a quick look around for any sign of Imperial riders.  “I don’t see any.”
“Do you think that they might see you?”
In his rush to scramble off the boulder, Pyetle fell butt-first onto the slope of the hill. He was able to catch himself, so instead of rolling down the scree, he slid down it. When he got to the bottom, he stood up in front of Ayram and apologized.
“I’m sorry. I was just curious. I’m not used to the whole desert bandit thing. Hiding in holes and whatnot.”
Ayram wasn’t looking at Pyetle. He was looking at the cloud of dust that Pyetle had kicked up when he slid down the scree. It was rising slowly into the air, twirling in on itself, measuring both the vortex/convective wind and the magnitude of Pyetle’s shame.
Ayram shook his head.
“Pyetle, do people find you to be annoying? Is this kind of thing a common kind of thing with you?”
Pyetle’s jaw would have dropped at the bluntness of the question if it weren’t already drawn tight by embarrassment. As such, Pyetle could barely stammer out the word, “No.”
“You need to understand something, so I’m going to state it clearly,” Ayram said. “I invest in people. My people. Ayramun. And I’ll invest in you if you do something with it.”
Pyetle nodded.
“I haven’t made the point yet,” Ayram said. 
Pyetle, looking up, thought Ayram seemed inhuman. Greater than human. He was so much bigger, too big to be the same kind of thing as he.
“You’re a little careless, Pyetle. That’ll get you killed. There’s no shame in getting killed - but carelessness? Is that how you want to go?”
“No.”
“Then keep in mind that things out here are trying to kill you. Right now they’re trying to kill you. Not just the Imps. Bugs. Lizards. The sun. Hell, there could be a beatboar hogging your scent. If I can smell the drink on you from here, then he can from a mile away.”
“I’m sorry.”
Ayram smacked his teeth, like he’d just tasted something foul. “Out here the kind of mistakes that require apologies are the ones that get people killed. So don’t ever say that. ‘I’m sorry’. Not to me. Just do better. Else I’ll be trying to kill you too.”
“I understand.”
“You don’t. But I have a way to make it a little clearer. Come.”
Pyetle followed Ayram around the lip of the pit and back to where Moteah had left him. From there they went to the hill with the cave where he was to take his oath. The entrance to it was narrow, and it matched Pyetle’s height, so Ayram had to duck down and shimmy sideways to get in. Pyetle stopped at the entrance, and tried to see inside.
The interior was lit by a narrow sliver of sunlight that cut down from the entrance and crawled along the floor. It was enough because the cave was small, and the light could bounce around. It was almost like the inside of sandstone ball, with Ayram standing at the far end. To his right, was Pella, hunched and. To left was the witch Elrahet. In between them, cut into the rock floor, was a round hole the width of a foot. 
When Pyetle stepped into the cave, his body cut out the light. Elrahet and Pella each grabbed a wrist, and then Ayram dropped something into the hole.
“How do you feel about the Empire?” Pella asked. Her grip was firm and tight, stronger than Pyetle had expected from a woman of her age.
“I don’t really care about it one way or the other,” Pyetle said. He was sure that Pella had been expecting him to say he hated the Empire. All the other Ayramun seemed to. But something about the scene suggested simple honesty was the best course of action. He felt that something was considering him, sniffing him out. Some sense oustide the normal, which could target truth.
“The Empire kills and it rapes,” Pella replied. “It grinds the wealth and culture of the world to dust. Have you not seen it? Is that not why you are here among us?”
Pyetle was unsure of what to say. His answer would obviously be ‘no’, so he didn’t understand why Pella was pressing the issue. She was trying to catch him out. For what reason, he couldn’t fathom. Maybe she just didn’t like him. 
In the end it was Ayram who answered Pella’s question.
“Pyetle is here because he followed me here. It is as simple as that.”
“No passion, then,” Pella croaked. 
“Remove your shirt.”
Pyetle did.
An odor began to rise out of the hole in the ground. A green glow.
Then Elrahet stabbed in him the belly with a knife.
He doesn’t feel much. Wanted to scream but couldn’t. The words caught in throat, and he couldn’t breath. 
Ayram then reached out, grabbed his shoulder, and threw him him face down to the earth. Pyetle’s belly, and his open wound, was flush over the hole. Then his sense started to dull. He could no longer smell the sulfur. But instead of going dark, his mind began to swim with visions. Flashes of  color, different scenes. The outlines of Ayram’s eyes swirling through them, part of them, edges lost but still there, watching. 
‘Coming to’ moment where ayrams true visage are loaded behind the eyes. Pyetle begins to wonder if Ayram gave him the vision or share in it. If he knew what he was thinking, etc.
After some time, which Pyetle later learned was only a minute, Ayram pulled him up from the ground. When Pyetle searched his belly, he found there was no wound, and that in its place was the brand of the Ayramun.
&quot;Rise my child, Pyetle of the Ayraman. You have been consecrated.”


Purpose of this hallucination is to hint at Ayram’s capacity to truly end a human’s soul.

Father and son merchants.

The first in a line of modest men, with access to a higher truth.
The schism in the modern world is between those who feel that their version of the truth demands that it must be enforced, and those who feel that the only right you have is to make your case to people who are then left alone to agree or not agree. 

Son talks with priest:
You are old enough now to know the truth of it. There are two different approaches to understanding what has been revealed to us in the Four Pillars; you take someone else’s word for what the scriptures mean, or you can quest the meaning for yourself. 
You’re saying that what I’ve been taught isn’t true? 
No. Certainty in spiritual matters is an illusion. Careful analysis of the Pillars will reveal to you how men like Comtois hide the nuance of the Ogma’s revelation within practiced sermons and a confident smile. The truth is that the scripture of the Pillars are a guiding light. This light is bright, diffuse, and holy, blinding to us who look into it. One can not outline the sun, lest you go blind. Those of us who claim to see a clear outline of the source are deluded. 
Speak plainly, good father.
A child’s mind requires clarity, Domel. The simple story that Comtois taught you as a child filled that need, but you are a man now. You’re going to need to learn to make peace with complexity of reality, for complexity leads to uncertainty, and uncertainty leads to doubt, and from doubt, apostasy.
Should I not fulfill what the Emperor commands of me? Is he not Divine?
Comtois taught you that the Emperor is literally and wholly the Divine Ogma. I say to you that the Emperor is a reflection of it. When you worship the Emperor you worship the Divine vis-a-vis the Emperor.
What is the difference?
A reflection can be distorted. Look down into the water - you see yourself. In one moment the image is clear, and the water moves, and the next it is fragmented.
As Senka and Dobril looked into the waves Father Comtois interrupts. 
Don’t Listen to him, boy.
Ah, Comtois. Skulking about in my shadow again?
You’ll hang for your heresies, Senke. 
You have tried already Comtois, and the Bisphoric Council has settled this matter.
And you think the Council is the final authority on scripture? Only God’s incarnate presence can judge this matter! 
The Emperor? But he is not also a man? Is it not impossible for him to wholly understand understand his own nature?
Comtois laughs. “Do you see what is happening son? Bishops like Senke play language games to hide their political ambition. Instead of interpreting the Four Pillars plainly, as is right, they ferret out interpretations of the Pillars that wrest power away from the Emperor, so that they might have it. They deny his divinity so that they may deny his commands!
And I can say the same for the Emperor, peace be upon him.
If the scriptures had wanted us to think of the king is merely a reflection of God’s true nature, it would have said as much!
It just an analogy to -
But Senk’s point was cut short by the Comtois’ righteous indignation.
“Many wander blindly, who claim to see the path.”
“For the true path is hidden, for it is not well traveled.”
These people know what is due a king.

“Grey, grey, grey,” Colm Triton muttered, shaking his head in disgust. He was still several leagues out from his legion’s bivouac, but already the scene was damnable. For as far as the fog revealed, the trees had been hewn for lumber, and their ugly stumps pocked the rolling foothills like warts on an ogre’s ass - and it was all just as grey, just as muddy, just as riddled with tufts of fungus. Absent sun and absent shadows, the land was absent life. 
“Cursed,” was the word that sprung to Colm’s mind. It was as if all the trees and bush and bramble had fled the place. Even the stoutest rocks seemed to want to burrow into the ground. Yet, men made their way into the valley from every corner of the Empire to swell the ranks of the Mud Legion. 
Whether they were all brave or stupid, Colm was  unsure, but he was one of them all the same.
 He eyed his comrades warily, noting how each face was more sullen and weary than the last. Just skin and bones, save a few. 
“We’re fools, at the very least,” Colm reasoned. Only a column of fools would march towards the thing from which mutilated soldiers limped away. No clearer display of their prospects in battle could be arranged than those that littered the highway: A weary captain slumped in his saddle, arm slung tight to his chest. A footman whose whole head was swaddled in bloodstained rags. Another with no wounds to rival his comrades, but his face wore their trauma all the same.  
In this last day alone Colm’s troop had passed twelve of these decimated companies, and yet they kept marching. So, brave or stupid, they were fools at the very least, brave fools as they may be.
But there were far more people heading towards the camp than away, and it pleased Colm to see that most of these weren’t soldiers. That meant the camp, and the wall that it worked to maintain, had reached some measure of stability. 
A distant, roaring horn.
Its echo muted the rumbling of wagon wheels and the squelching of mud underfoot. 
An Orc horn, sounding like the scream of an Epegrine Eel out of water.
Colm troop take it in like noobs.. 
One of the wounded veterans leaving the front caught Colm’s eye. He seemed to be laughing at them. A bloody stump of a left arm and yet he laughed.“Hear that Comrades?” the laughing wretch asked. “The horn blows for you! Go and earn your wages!” At that he reached into the wagon next to him and pulled out a bag of coin and shook it. “It’ll only cost an arm or a leg!”  The other weary sods around him laughed, but not even this bit of humor pausing their rueful exodus. 
“Fool’s gone mad,” said the former beggar boy, Trim, who marched to Colm’s left. 
“No, I don’t think so.” said Colm. “That’s you or me in three months.”
“You or me?”
“Did you count how many men were left in that poor sod’s column? Less than half I’d wager.”
“Well, we could both be part of the less-than-half that lives,” said Trim. 
The fallen priest to Colm’s right chuckled at Trim’s innocent resolve - but it didn’t go too far as his neck was wrung so tight by the chain of excommunication that he struggled even to breathe. In fact, that chuckle was the first peep Colm had heard from the scrawny young heretic since their journey began twelve weeks ago. 
Colm appreciated how, as a group, they formed a neat tableau of the waste product that oozed out from the Empire’s machinery. Colm himself typified the numberless poor that wandered the countryside, somehow lucky enough to be born a freeman, but had done nothing with it and so was forced, at thirty, into soldiery. Trim was refuse from the Capital. Here too was an excommunicated priest. There was even a woman, marching right ahead of Colm. She was at least forty, with skin as leathery as the Sergeant who had assembled them. Still, Colm had made his passes at her. In their months of marching, all he had gotten in return was a nasty array of scowles. 
amped in that desolate place for five months, more than long enough for their twenty thousand white canvas tents to become so thickly matted grey with grime that Colm Triton mistook them for massive rocks strewn about by a landslide.
“What am i doing...” he muttered as he crested the last foothill. From there he could see the Mud Legion’s camp in its entirety; a city unto itself.  People everywhere, headed to and fro. Soldiers, families, a whole network of eager merchant stalls. Thousands upon thousands of cattle grazing in the shadow of the northern range. Buildings too, perhaps a thousand of them, worked up against each other, stilted and shanty. It had the makings of a metropolis. Present, even, was the stupefying haze of smoke and stink and clamour.
Colm let it wash over him in a nostalgic embrace. 
A proper writhing mass of humanity. Perhaps a hundred thousand. 
He inhaled deeply and let the seasoned vapors fill his lungs before letting loose a contented sigh. “Glory to the Empire,” he whispered. 
He could sense opportunity nestled in every nook and cranny of that sprawling micro-nation. All thoughts of woe and dread were driven from his mind in an instant. As if sharing Colm’s rapture, Trim said aside, “The orcs don’t stand a chance. Not a chance!”
 “Yes boy! Not a chance!” shouted the Sergeant in reply as he hopped up on the back of one of their carts so that the troop could eye him neatly. 
“Men!” he shouted, drawing the rest of the troop to attention. The sergeant was a man’s man and his voice bellowed with vigor. Went by the name of Burgh. “We’re nearly to the front. Once we're through the checkpoint, I’ll drop you off with the rest of the muster while I go fetch our orders. I’ll also see to getting you a key for that thing on your neck,” he said, motioning to the ex-priest next to Colm. “I’ll be back with ya’ll by nightfall, so get a fire going. Also, some good news,” he held up a white slip and flagged it back and forth. “A barrel of beer on arrival, courtesy of the General Elect.” At that a few cheers went up, and Burgh passed the slip off to his corporal. “Jan here is in charge of it. Don’t give him any beef. Save it for the enemy. And don’t,” he paused for effect, staring down a few of the more troublesome men, skipping over Colm, “I repeat - do not -  get mixed up in anything unsavory. If my ass gets chewed out, your ass gets torn up. So. Orders tonight. Ration the booze till I get back - might have marching sticks on the morrow.”
At that there was a collective groan, but Burgh just laughed as he hopped off the wagon.

Here, the onslaught of the orc was a daily affair, but the legion did well to hold its ground behind their massive palisade wall. Stake by stake they tried to advance the wall to the western valley entrance and secure access to the Vand, but progress was uneven. Two steps forward in one spot meant two steps back in another. The orc were too numerous. Slay one and another seemed to apparate out of the fog, or rise from the very earth all caked in mud and blood to nip at your tendons. Even the rocks seemed alive with the chattering squeal of orc-gibber. It was whispered through the ranks that to battle against this foe was to battle against the Way of Nature itself. “The Vand belongs to the orc, it always has, and that’s how it’s meant to be.” Some men would nod and agree, but there was never time for discontent to take hold - too present was their task, too deadly their enemy. At any moment a band of bloodbeasts and berserkers might spawn at the foot of the wall and threaten to chew a gap in the timber wide enough to unmake the whole Mud Legion. 
Suffice to say, it was not a good place to be. The Empire’s elite Yarmukan Guards would have struggled to keep their heads on their shoulders, yet much of the Mud Legion were soldiers in name only; those on stake-watch were barely fifteen years old, hairless balls and all, fitting into their lamellar like lambs in wolf skin.
Stake crews had the worst of it. These were the men tasked with mounting pockets of stakes beyond the wall, patterning them that they might be defended with bowshot, and connecting them with wall-proper when possible. In this way the wall was meant to blob westward, and it was damnable work - but there was hazard pay, highest for the shovelers, who had only their shovel to defend themselves. Their spears had been taken away by orders of the presiding General Elect, Binganham, in the hopes that they might “Spend less time fighting and more time digging.”
“You’ve got a five volley count until the orc reaches you,” Binganham would shout during the stake crew drills, “And by that time you better have dug the hole and planted the stake, or you'll all likely be killed.”
From his commanding heights Binganham understood that tactical speed, not force, was the only way his wall was going to reach the western side. He drilled the stake crews relentlessly. “The Emperor won’t save you lads, God-King he may be. I sure as hell won’t save you. Your egress crews might save you, but they’re as likely to get pricked by an orc needle as anyone. Get this stake mounted and be back up the rope in a whisper-click and you live. Plus, a barrel of booze to the crew that plants the most stakes each day.”
In this way, when a particularly gaunt orc jumped into a trench filled with shovelling legionnaires, he was not seeking to disrupt the extension of the palisade wall, nor did he seek a glorious death of the body, he sought the death of his mind - a subtle but powerful distinction, for once the flesh is dead the fighting is done, but once madness takes hold, and Comprehension gained, he becomes a ‘Kharmisar’, ‘one who thinks in blood.’ 

“Pek Morgash Gra!” screamed a mighty orc beast as he swung his cleaver at the shaft of Rhyn’s spear, trying to break it as it lay stuck in the belly of an orc rider. Instinctively Rhyn tried to twist the spear out of the felling arc, but the orc moved like lightning and Rhyn pulled free only a splintered haft. 
He had already lost his rondel dagger to the mud. Now with only a heater shield, he was at his end. The beast in front of him was a monster. A full seven feet - taller than any orc he’d yet seen. Skinny like a basketball player.Silhouette aginst the fires of battle. 
Rhyn cast a sideways glance in desparate hope of relief, but in the dark of night he could see nothing. His only hope was to

Only the darkest pit of night but respite. It was then that all orc aggression ceased, in ritual adherence to some profane principal. It was in these few hours that the soldiers of the Mud Legion were at their busiest, inching their wall pilar by pillar further up the pass. Their objective was their only true law: establish a foothold for the Empire in orclands.

Chapter 2 : Pyetle


	The poet Mandrameen believed that the empire’s religions were all distortions of the Truth, but even so, they were our only way to access it. As such, he taught that any honest seeker of theTruth must be a practitioner of all religions. For this he built an analogy out of the famous Library of Jeket.
If an artist were locked inside and wanted to paint a perfectly accurate picture of the marble Pillar of Saulistides which stands out in the garden, the artist must look through the building’s windows to see it - windows whose glass was fogged and warped with age. In the one window pane, the pillar would appear stretched. In another it would seem waved. In yet another it was so curved that the friezes of Saulistedes’ armies which wrapped around the marble seemed to climb up into the sky. 
Since each window pane distorted the Pillar in its own peculiar way, it would be a mistake for the artist to paint their picture using only the information gleaned from a single view. The artist should instead move from window to window, from distortion to distortion, averaging out the truth of the Pillar’s shape from the lies.
This was how Mandrameen practiced religion - by moving from one religion to another, averaging out the true shape of Reality from ancient myths so distorted with age. He would consider them together, and start with their similarities instead of their differences. From this exercise he found what he believed was the core of every religion: a story to explain the existence and nature of suffering.
The Cult of the Dreamer, for example, believed that all suffering is caused by nightmares that emerge from the minds of those who still sleep in the Waking Dream. Only those who recognize the Dream for what it is - a fabrication or an illusion - can achieve Lucidity and escape these nightmares.
The Soleans believed that we were created by their gods to be slaves. Suffering comes into play because Sol and his mistress Luna intentionally created us with certain particular deficiencies which keep us angry at each other instead of angry at gods themselves. Chief among these faults were an abundance of lust (Libis), innate love for those who are kin and hatred for those who are not (Paroch), and an insatiable desire to improve our own personal status (Egos). Even kings are never happy with what they have and who they’re fucking. 
The Kalemites believed that we were once a link in the Great Chain of Being, once part of an indistinguishable whole. However, the profane lure of individuality caught a hold of one of the Number, and so this misguided soul severed its link to the Chain, spawning all life on earth, dooming us and the animals to loneliness, to an existence where our minds can never touch one another’s, to a state of being where it is possible to be lost, forgotten, and unloved.
In all this, Mandrameen believed, was something of the true shape of Reality: whether it be by accident or intention, we were designed to suffer.
The cynic Seculla was not impressed. She thought that Mandrameen’s wide study of religions was biased towards those that survived. Her calculus was simple: any religion which might preach that Paradise is here and that Peace is now would be trampled underfoot by the hordes of the suffering and damned, for they demand answers and atonement for their troubles, and a religion which preaches contentment with the present cannot give it.  
She quoted the difficulty that priests of the Dreamer had in converting the isolated tribe of Het. “They cannot see through the eyes of the Dreamer for they are not plagued by His nightmares,” one priest wrote. “Here, food is plenty. War is absent. They spend their days swimming, fishing, and building houses high in the trees. They are happy… they simply do not understand.” Two of the priests sent to convert this tribe abandoned their frocks and took up wives in that Hetian village. This was proof, to Seculla at least, that suffering was not an intrinsic part of the human condition. It comes from somewhere else.
Whether or not she is correct is a matter for theologians and philosophers. For common folk, like Pyetle, it does not matter from whence suffering comes, only that it comes too often. When his business began to fail, and when his wife took a lover, he could not console himself with thoughts of happy Hetian villagers. The only thing that could tear his mind from the look on his wife’s face as she pleaded for him to stay, was the rainstorm that caught him drunk in the streets of Jeket. 
Sol had conjured this whipping rain just to torment him, he thought. What other purpose could there be for a storm so fierce and so far out of season? Surely, it was a joke of the Gods. As Pyetle staggered and slipped along the cobbled street of the Sauline Hill, the high center of the city, he cursed Sol and all His Creation. 
“This, and this, and this, and this,” he muttered, counting his sufferings. The drink kept his blood warm and his legs moving, though he was not headed anywhere in particular. When he reached the quarried cliff of the hill, he sat down. From there he could see the city of Jeket in all its splendor.
Eight wide boulevards  spread out from the Hill in the eight directions, and they stretched far across the river plain. From these branched roads, and from these branched alleys, all ordered and angled according to the symmetry found in the Solar Fern, the plant which grows all along the banks of the Jade River. Flat and square mud brick tenements sprouted out from these stems, and scurrying amongst them were tiny specks of people. They seemed like blackflies, jumping from leaf to stem to leaf, tending to the needs of the plant which gave them shelter and life, suckling at the fruits of their labors:  The clay Pyramid of Larat. The roofless columns of the Temple of the Dreamer. The sky-eyed domes of the Solean pantheon. Each was more magnificent than the last. 
The most grand of them all, the massive granite walls which ringed the city, were distant enough from Pyetle that they seemed small. From there, a patchwork of farms and canals stretched to the banks of the Jade River, then continued on from the other side to the horizon. 
High above these distant fields, massive anvil-head thunderstorms lumbered like giants, walking on misty columns of rain. Their hearts rumbled with thunder, and their bodies blocked out the sun. All was grey save for the yellow sliver of a horizon, but that was enough to fleck the river, the canals, and flooded fields with gold. Even the rippling puddles at Pyetle’s feet sparkled. 
It was beautiful. 
Beautiful - just not meant for him. 
Jeket. The world. This beauty - no place in it for Pyetle.
“Fuck it,” he said to himself as the rain beat his back and the cold began to creep in. “It’s not worth it.”
He took the knife that he had just bought out of his pocket, unsheathed it, and cupped it's blade in the palm of his hand. It was an exquisite piece, as a thousand specks of tin had been hammered into the cherry hilt, forming a twisting, wind-like pattern. The blade itself was so finely polished that he could see his reflection in it. He could see how his eyes were red and witless, how his nose was runny, and how his cheeks were sunk and sallow. He looked older than he expected, with wrinkles and furrows and sun-spot blemishes. Older than he felt. 
The sight of his aged self transformed his feelings of despair and shame into anger, as it made visceral the notion that he had wasted his years of youth and vigor, that he had already played his hand and had lost, beaten by Nature, the Gods, and greedier, cleverer men. 
He stabbed at the puddle with his knife, then he stood up, turned his back on this privileged vista, set his shoulder against the wind and rain, and made his way to Salavan Saran’s house to kill the man who had ruined his life. 
After that, he had only to decide how he wanted to die, for he had decided against killing himself. A better way would be to wander down one of the thief infested alleys near the Heberdee Gate. One final stab in the back would be a more fitting end.


---


“Pyetle, my friend! Come in, come in,” said Salavan Saran with a smile. He was a huge man, tall and rotund, clad in a yellow robe replete with roses embroidered in pink. He beckoned Pyetle past his guards and onto his covered stoop and out of the rain. “I was beginning to wonder if you were coming,” he said. “Marta and the girls are out, so it’s just us.”
“I hope Marta was able cook a little something before she left,” said Pyetle.
“Yes, yes, I told her you were on the way,” Sal said with a chuckle. “She finished a few potstickers before she left, just for you.” 
“Your wife is Divine.”
“Indeed she is. And how is Claire?” 
Pyetle paused and removed his sandals, then stuck his feet out into the rain to wash them of mud. “Well, I took her to the Fordwell the other day,” he said.
	“Ah yes, I recall; you said you two were having some issues. Did your little sojourn through nature have the desired effect?” Sal asked.
“No.”
“I see,” said Sal as he gave little Pyetle a practiced but insincere look of concern.
The little man was a pitiful sight, so drenched and drunk as he was, with his skinny neck seeming barely able to support his weary head. 
“You’re soaking,” Salavan said, “Let me get you a towel and some clothes.”
“No, no, that’s fine, I won’t won’t be long.”
“I insist,” Salavan said, then clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out with some dry towels and a simple white tunic. Pyetle followed the boy into a washroom, dried and changed, then came out into the main hall.
As if an honored position on the Sauline Hill were not enough, Salavan’s home was nearly as large and as tall as any other in Jeket, and its opulence was second to none. It had cost Sal three siver-strings of imported lumber just to burn enough lime to make enough plaster to coat the massive walls. The rare paints for the fresco that wrapped around the open-roofed atrium took another fortune more - though it was worth it, for it was a magnificent work of art, in skill and in subject. It depicted Sol at the very moment of his apotheosis. The sun-god wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his blade jutting out from his father’s chest.
“To business then!” Salavan exclaimed as he appeared from behind Pytele, clapping him on the back and guiding him up to the second floor, where dinner awaited. As they took the stairs, Salavan tried to prepare Pyetle with some flattering remarks.
“Pyetle, you know I’ve been impressed with how you’ve handled things, considering the circumstances. Lesser men would have folded a year ago, but you’ve persisted. I value that in a partner.”
	“It couldn’t have been more perfect,” Pyetle lamented.
	“Eh?”
	“As soon as we stepped foot in the Fordwell, she must’ve said, ‘So beautiful’ at least twenty times.”
	“Ah, I see. Business can wait, I suppose.”
	“Sol could have descended in a cloud right then and there to give me his blessing. I mean it was a beautiful day.”
	“Well, so is today,” said Sal as they came up to the second floor with its high windows that offered a stunning view of the city. Protected from the rain as they were, it was all so calm and soothing. Sol himself hung just above the western horizon, peeking through the clouds, a resplendent golden orb, almost winking at them.
The furnishings of Salavan’s second story were muted and tasteful so as to pick up Sol’s light instead of overwhelm it. Here the floor was covered in massive rugs that were subtly patterned and white and trimmed with glittering gold ropes, so that they served as giant picture frames for the colors that Sol threw upon them. There were pillows upon pillows for comfort, with gold tassels and ivory lace threading them together. In one corner the floor had been carved out to accommodate a hefty hotstone, heated by the kitchen below, and it was already portioned with meats. At the sides of the stone were reclining chairs made of rope strung into angled ebony frames. Pyetle sighed as he reclined into his, then munched on a potsticker that he had pulled from the hotstone. 
“Claire has been the hardest bit for me,” Pyetle said in between bites. “The losses, the caravans, the thieves, I can handle those. But her… I invested myself into her.”
	“You two aren’t separating are you?”
Pyetle sighed. “She was cheating on me, Salavan.”
“Oh?”
	Pyetle eyed Salavan warily, trying to catch some degree of recognition or hint of worry. But Salavan was a master of his emotions.
“Pyetle, you’re in a tragic spot and I’m sorry for that,” Sal said as he lit up a wrap of freeweed before settling into his chair. “But, I’ve got to be honest - I can’t relate to what you are going through. I’ve heard stories of loves-lost and loves-lorn and I’ve tasted it a little, but, well you know that Marta and I were kids when we were married.”
“I know.”
“So,” Sal said before taking a long drag from his wrap, “I can give you financial and business advice, but what you need right now, I can’t give it to you.”
	Pyetle bit into another potsticker, and he savored the sweet peach sauce in which the shredded chicken had been baked.
“This is so good. If only I could steal Marta from you.”
“You are certainly welcome to try,” Sal said, smiling.
“I suppose I would fail.” Pyetle moaned. “It seems the only time I've really been shown intimacy is when I pay for it.” 
	“Pyetle...”
	“It’s this face. This damned body. Like my father’s - I don’t understand how he ever got a woman to stick with him.”
	“Your father was richer than I am.”
	“It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter,“ Pyetle asserted, eager not to be distracted from his endgame. 
Sal took another drag from his wrap before continuing on to his point. “Just settle for a woman that will have you for your money. You’ve not got much of it left, but any little bit of money has a way of motivating a person to look deeper into a Being. First she’ll have you for your money, and I trust, in time, she’ll have you for you.” 
	“I’ve been married to Claire for 13 years, Sal. You’re saying I should move on already?”
	Sal leaned back in his ornamented chair and folded his hands across his stomach and sighed. “You’ve spent your whole life getting what you want in the way that you want it, Pyetle, except this one thing. You’re spoiled - no, that’s not fair - You’re stubborn. Women of consequence, women like Claire, they pick up on that as soon as you open your mouth. No one wants to be stuck with a stubborn ass for a lifetime.”
	“Is that so?”
Sal had expected Pyetle to leap into defence of his character, as he usually did whenever Sal got in a personal jab. The flippancy was disturbing. Sal looked down his nose at Pyetle, and in the flickering firelight he caught the glimmer of tears streaking down his face. He looked away in disgust, and caught sight of the horizon. There, Sol’s light was dimming, the rain was letting up, and through it he could make out the evening song of Swassel birds drifting in on a cool breeze. The mood would have been delightful if it weren’t for Pyetle’s downer.
“Have some freeweed,” Sal demanded.
	“No.”
	“Pyetle, I may not know your kind of sorrow, but I’ve had my share of sorrow in general, and a wrap of freeweed blunts its edge. It’s the only thing I can offer you. Take it.”
	Pyetle wiped his eyes with the palm of his hand and tried to compose himself before taking a wrap from the tray near him. He then stood up to light it in the fire that burned above the hotstone.
	“I think this is it for me,” Pyetle said as he rolled the tip of the wrap in the flame. “I’m done. I’m finally done.”
	“What do you mean?” Sal asked.
	“You’re going to make me say it?”
	“Say what? You’re giving up?”
 	Pyetle simply smiled, turned his chair to face Salavan, and sat back down to nurse his freeweed and glare at Salavan.
“Well, I’m sure you’ve considered all alternatives.”
“Alternatives...”
“Did you ever get to hear old Pella Germin speak?”
“I don’t go in for that.”
“I heard her preach once. She said that we are expected to kill ourselves.”
“Did she?”
“She said something like, ‘Corruption is a stain that does not wash off. To be free of it, to achieve peace, you must first kill yourself.’”
“You were there when she preached this?”
“I was. For a while I marked it as the ravings of a common Dreamer, especially considering what came of her. But, in time, I saw some wisdom in it. Perhaps I put the wisdom there, but it felt like I found it. So tell me, have you tried killing yourself? Figuratively, I mean.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“I guess it means, try living for a little bit as if Pyetle Pernderser were dead.”
“That’s a bit heretical, even for you.”
“No, no, no. Follow me here. From this moment on, Pyetle is dead, and residing inside 
this fleshy vessel is… whatever you want to put in there.”
	“If it were possible... I would like to rip out my heart. But I don’t think it works that way.”
	Sal leaned forward. The freeweed was working its energy into him. “Your broken heart is there because you put it there. Pyetle put it there. If you kill Pyetle, he can no longer stop you from throwing away his treasure.”
	“I put it there?”
	“Yes! You have to accept that.”
	“I was thinking it was Claire who put it there.”
	“Only because you let her.”
	“I was also thinking you put it there, Sal.”
	“Me?” Salavan asked.
	“Weren’t you the one who was fucking her?”
	Salavan’s face contorted into a quizzical look.
	“Is that what she told you?”
	“That’s what I gathered.”
	“Pyetle, you’re so goddamned stupid. You’ve been running from responsibility your whole life and now that it’s catching up to you... You… Ah, you came to kill me, didn’t you?”
	Pyetle reached into his tunic for his knife, but it wasn’t there. He had left it in wet clothes downstairs.
	“You did, didn’t you! I was wondering about this - ” Salavan held up Pyetle’s knife. “I know you’re one of those loony Dreamers who never travel armed, and so I wondered. But I thought you were just trying to kill yourself.”
	Pyetle gulped his fears in. The prospect of losing even this final encounter terrified him even more than whatever painful plans Salavan had in store.
	 Salavan stood up out of his chair, and moved towards Pyetle. “I’m impressed, Pyetle. Perhaps now your eyes are being opened to the potential that lies in your still beating heart. Perhaps now you realize the Will of your own Being. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it. Perhaps it was the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing?” 
Salavan grabbed Pyetle, then threw him down to the ground. “What did you dream of, Pyetle?” Salavan shouted as he used his great bulk to wrestle Pyetle’s flailing limbs into submission. It wasn’t difficult considering Pyetle’s drunken stupor. “Was it a great and terrible crime? A radical act of charity?” Salavan put the knife up hard against Pyetle’s throat, and his large weight squeezed the air from his lungs. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here at death’s door you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this, it’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan began to choke Pyetle with his heavy hand, and Pyetle gasped for air. “Yes, I can see it! Hah! I can see it there inside of you now!” Salavan held the knife up to Pyetle’s mouth as the little man kicked. “Yes! What is about to happen here is a great crime - but it’s yours! When you pass on into the Hellespont, that should be your final thought, that you let it come to this, you let your Will stagnate, and here I am,” Salavan declared, “about to take it from you. Because I can!” 
	Before Salavan could plunge the knife into Pyetle’s throat, an arrow whizzed in pierced his hand.
	“EAAAUUUGHHH!” Salavan screamed, dropping the knife. Pyetle pulled himself out from under Sal’s weight, and wriggled up against the wall. There at the window was a man, a giant man, massive even when compared to Salavan, yet lanky and coordinated. In his hand was a bow that was nearly as tall as he.
	“Thief! Brigand!” Salavan yelled, clutching at his pierced hand.
	“Scream all you like, Salavan,” said the giant at the window. “None of your house is alive to hear you.”
Salavan went silent, then scrambled to his feet and ran towards the stairs, but he stopped when he saw that it was blocked by another dark figure. Sal stumbled backwards, then turned and faced the intruder with defiance.
“Take what you will and be gone!” he shouted.
The giant just laughed, “I plan to. But first, do you know who I am?” 
Salavan eyed the man up and down to get his measure. A man of such stature could only be the famous Giant of the Junei. “You’re Ayram. We’ve done business.”
“We’ve recently done business,” the giant pointed out, “and you didn’t hold up your end of the bargain.”
“What do you mean?”
“The information you gave the go-between was bad. My people -” he said, nodding to whoever was at the stairs, “have got it in their heads that you set us up.” Salavan looked behind him, and a short, squat figure all wrapped in black came up the stairs, blade drawn, pointed at Salavan’s ass. 
“What!?” Salavan exclaimed. “I never would - why would I do that!? I’ve nothing to gain by doing that. There’s only the-”
“Yes,” the giant interrupted. “I was thinking the same, Sal. Getting me to pick off your competitors is certainly more valuable than anything the Empire could offer you. So there’s got to be something deeper going on.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“Maybe you don’t. It could be that someone funneled bad information to you, knowing you would funnel it to me. In which case, where did you get the information from.”
“You know that I’m the exchequer for the mining guild. I have access to all of the -”
“That wasn’t a mining column, Sal.”
“What?”
“That was a column of Imperial cavalry, Sal.”
“What?” Sal asked, before letting out a shrill “EAUGGHH” as the short figure behind him prodded in between his buttcheeks with his sword.
“I have no idea what you’re -”
“I think you do! You knew there was a Mensan among them, didn’t you.”



“Yes, but do you know anymore. Don’t lie to me. I’ll know if you’re lying.”
“
	“Burning Gods, bless this stupid man with light.” Grabs him by the shoulders. “You’re right, Pyetle, you’re right. No one - and I do mean no one - cares about you. If you kill yourself tomorrow, the rest of us here will be back in our routines within a month. For me, your memory will bring a pang of ill-humor now and then, but I’ll muddle through. So do it. Kill yourself. But do it in such a way that your corporeal body can be used for something greater. If you hollow out your Being you might even become an instrument for the Divine. Offer your body up as a tool for the Gods if you’ve no more use for it.”
“Closter Germin taught this?”
“Gods, man!”
	Sal released Pyelte. “Life has put you on a path, Pyetle. Unfair as it may be, it does not lead to the Plenitude. I just think you owe it to yourself, this one final

            <Text>Artist.
Mandrameen despised the word.
Who isn’t an artist?
A dancer, a poet, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a hole-digger? He can be an artist too if he digs holes in a way that’s true to himself. Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and likely as not he’ll have mounded up a penis.
Is that art?
Mandri thought so. Its sublimity surpassed, by a few hundred yards, the triptych’d nudes of Allasoreen. Even a tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed. Mandri believed that all tax collectors are artists.
A true artist, though, that is a distinction with walls, and it has almost nothing to do with what a person does—whether it be dancing, digging, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never do anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artistry—god-given talent—that is a state of mind. To be sure, its not a noble one. It’s about comic excess; too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense self that it becomes impossible to describe without resorting to sarcasm.
For example: Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.
When asked what he did for a living, he’d say, “Nothing important. I make things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. Then he’d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and this charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then he’s flash a knowing smile. 
He’d say these things right to an artist’s face if he could get to it. He didn’t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. Maybe they were the only safe targets, because it’s not really the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are completely different things. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity.
Now, none of that is necessarily true, but the truth of it doesn’t matter. The point is that Mandri believed—in his bones if not his brain—that true artists are all pricks, they say prickish things, and that he was a true artist.
He would to say to a young Hrkan prince, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” The prince’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Budding lordship be damned, Mandri’s knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if he wasn’t correct in the literal, figurative, or spiritual sense, well, the other person certainly wrong as well. 
This he believed with the certainty of a Solitant priest: subjectivity does not exist.
Such a miracle of denial seems like it shouldn’t be possible. Two people look at the same painting and walk away disagreeing about its worth. Who is to say who is right? Mandrameen, that’s who. He’d bob his narrow face, scratch his peach-fuzz chin, sigh like the weight of he world was on his tiny shoulders, and then he’d say that one of those people was wrong. Maybe both were idiots. He’d tell you who was what once he’d seen the painting for himself.
And people accommodated him. All his bright-eyed years he was told that he was Solraheen’s gift to humanity, and it wasn’t just his grandmother saying this, it was everyone. They said it because Mandrameen, at the age of ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
These were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait, he observed a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of color he could define the skin, the cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, and even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman’s portrait using just twenty-four strokes—count them, twenty-four. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. Nobody noticed them. It didn’t stop scribes from marveling at how he packed so much information into so few slaps of pigment. 
“These are the marks of genius,” they’d say. No sarcastic smiles.
Then, as happens to young men and not to old, Mandrameen fell unawares into the deepest pit of love.
Things happened.
Soon after he was broke and would not leave his room. When someone knocked on his door and tried to commission a piece, he said no, they asked why, and he said, “I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.” Then he shut the door.
These hysterics weren’t only about a girl. In such a craft as painting there are limits. Once he achieved a certain degree of skill, he reached that elite tier where everyone is more or less as good as everyone else, and outside of the true artists, who are recognized only to themselves, the only thing that separates these professionals is how willing they are to ingratiate themselves with governors, princes, priests, and the like. Maybe novelty plays a role, but success was about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It was about how many people knew the raw fact of his existence. It was about manufacturing popularity at the expense of the real. Being the true artist that Mandri was, he refused to play this game. So, at the age of eighteen, he walked away from the craft and dived headfirst into hallucinogenic drugs.
The first time that Mandri picked brown burgeons, crushed them up, and smoked their dried juices instead of using them for pigment, a fundamental truth was revealed to him. Art was pointless. Obviously pointless.
Why?
Because every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. 
Mandrameen had traveled to every city on the holy continent, and he had seen every painting and every sculpture worth seeing and they all fell short of true beauty. The problem was always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see. When it comes to Nature, well, Nature is complex. If artists were smart, they might be able to approach it, but artists are people, and people are dumb, so they boil that complexity down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible lump of something which has got them transfixed; A flower, a nice pair of tits, a pretty face. Maybe it’d be a flower. What matters is that an artist tries to preserve the things that make life worth living by ripping them out of the fabric of reality and stitching their hides to a frame. Then, after having captured and killed the sublime, they sell it. Some plucky merchant without a care buys it and mounts it on his wall right next to the sprawling, headless hides of lizards.
The commissions tore at Mandrameen. Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d have to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf—its complexity, its pattern, its anatomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one—all that complexity, that beauty, reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if you must paint the leaf, is to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. Maybe remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ bosom. Then you’ve really done it, you’ve not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, you’ve erased it from existence entirely.
And it wasn’t just the leaf, it was the rock, the cloud, and the tree, and how it all fit together. Even the sand played a role. Maybe one can say that Mandri wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture Nature’s essence, but that hardly matters. “Go and try and paint Nature,” Mandri would say to Meskalim’s bully children during a burgeon binge. “Take as long as you like. Take twenty five years on a single piece. Take a lifetime! Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…”
And then he’d forget what he was on about.
If he were sober, he would have said something about standing at the edge of the wilderness, a place with a big sky and maybe mountains. Go there and smoke some valley burgeons to get in the mood, then let the shock of Nature’s overwhelming beauty hit the spinal cord. If the mood is right, it will hit with an intensity that no poet or painter could ever hope to achieve.
So, there was no point in trying. It’s almost perverse to try—unless a young man needs to buy some burgeons. Then it’s perfectly acceptable for him to dip his toes back into the craft and give portraiture lessons to a wealthy man Vigram Druamalun.
Vigram was a burly old gentleman with a bald head and long belly-beard that he kept oiled, curled, and trimmed. He lived in a countryside villa, a good ways away from the must and crust of Meskalim, and he could afford to staff it with serving girls and a tiny private army.
Vigram was not a true artist, let alone an artist. Worse than a tax-collector, he was a creditor. He’d tell his life story to Mandrameen during lunches, and he’ d tell it in a way so as to suggest that his success was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too.
First, inherit two ounces of silver. Then, scrounge up another two ounces. Then, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure its a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing to be put to the torch in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, but get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and a pile of silver and the bleary shine will blind him.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s budding bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it’s got a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, its a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’re a human spider able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the continent. People will walk right into the debt. The wiggling only sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed. As long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it’s all self-sustaining. And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you want. Vigram spent his by dabbling in the sacred art of the oil portrait.
He was kneeling now in his trellised, red-brick patio. In his fumbling hands was an off-kilter easel which he’d made himself. Mandri stood behind him, the very picture of considered consideration.
Mandri said, “Are you sure you want to do this here.”
“Why?” asked Vigram. “Is there something wrong?”
“No. There’s nothing wrong, exactly. It’s that this light is going to make things so much harder.”
The patio’s trellis was crawling with vines, and that meant dappled light.
Vigram was looking at Mandri like the boy had 
“The sun moves, the shadows move…it’s a whole other thing to worry about. It’ll be easier if we keep it simple—clean light—that way there’s no leafy shadows drifting across the face when you’re trying to figure out which eye goes where.”
Vigram shook his head, and that sent his great brown beard wiggling like it were alive. He said, “My dear Mandri, the patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
“I see.”
“Yes,” said Vigram. “A magical vesture, for a magical subject.”
Vigram stepped back from his newly upright easel and smiled beneficently at his daughter, Ora. She was his favorite subject. Mandri’s age. The only one of his five children willing to sit for him. 
“Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?” asked Vigram.
“Undoubtedly,” said Mandri.
Mandri’s eyes flicked to Ora without intention, but Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions, and the old man’s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give his patriarchal blessing.
Ora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with a fertility goddess, but Mandri didn’t want to have children.
“Help her up,” Vigram commanded. “I’ll ready the canvas and palette.”
Mandri did as he was told and helped Ora up onto a high-legged stool. Ora let her fingers linger on his arm, and then Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.
Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.
Vigram picked up a stick of soft charcoal and began to map out the image. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong too. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner’s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. Ora’s head was, somehow, too small, and too left-of-center. There’d be an awkward expanse behind her curls.
“Hold—hold on,” Mandri said. “You’re moving too fast. Don’t think of this as a portrait—not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on this canvas. All you’re doing is putting an oval on the canvas. Where’s the best place to put it?”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.
He stepped back.
He studied Ora.
He stepped again to the canvas.
Then he scratched a big black oval right back where it had been.
“Is that better?” he asked.
Mandri took a step back, eyed the drawing, and then Ora, then he said, “It needs to be a little bigger, I think.”
Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger.
Almost every mark he made, he’d look to Mandri for reassurance.
When Mandri had, and when this happened too many times, he broke and said, “Don’t look at me, look at her.”
“But I need to know if it’s right or wrong.”
Mandri said, “Assume that it’s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it’s wrong, and then fix it.”
Vigram looked at Mandri like he’d said
“If it’s always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I’ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.”
“You move on when you want to move on.”
“Then I want to move on. I’m here to paint, not draw.”
Mandri sighed. “It’s your paint,” he said. “but you need to understand the importance of the drawing.”
“I do understand. You talk about it all the time. I just can’t do it.” Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.
Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first flurry of hues. What he was building was an affront to the senses. Mandri couldn’t look away because he was getting paid to have his eyes on it. There was only the canvas, and there was Ora, but he didn’t want to look at Ora because she was eying him up like he was her next meal. But dammit, he couldn’t help it, his eyes would instinctively wander to the sitter, and Ora’s smile would perk up. 
“Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.” The way Vigram said it, he wasn’
“I assure you, I’m not. I’m checking proportions.”
“If that’s the case, what do you think?” 
There’s a old folksy wisdom that claims that talented people don’t know how to teach. The idea is that talented people didn’t have to try to acquire their skills, and so how could they ever communicate the secrets of the craft when it all comes instinctively? 
That was bogwater. Mandri could write treatise on Vigram’s painting technique. Mandri also knew that Vigram wouldn’t be able to handle an unvarnished critique—almost no one can. The man might get offended, and then there’d be no more money for burgeons. So, teaching for Mandri was an exercise in patience and pretending. No matter how horrifying the work was, always, always, start off with a compliment. 
“It’s good,” he said after long .
Mandri sat back in his hips, crossed his arms, and let his eyes race around the painting. He made every honest effort to take in the observations that Vigram was finding, or rather, losing in that blur of muddy color. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner’s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes. It can be done, but its dangerous. Oils dry too slow. 
“Vigram…”
“I know, I know.”
“I’m gonna say it anyways—get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the pallette is there for.” 
Mandri watched as Vigram as he mixed a bluish shade of beige for Ora’s chin. It was a color that only works for the chin a man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, “That’s not quite right.” He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, rubbed it into the manly chin, and of course, that wasn’t quite right either. 
This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
“It’s not bad,” he said.
The charcoal lines looked like they were bleeding pus.
The worst part was the dappled light. One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Ora’s left eye, and on the canvas it looked like the girl was wearing an eye-patch.
Vigram looked like he needed a compliment. 
“It’s good,” said Mandri. “No really, I mean it. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.”
“It’s on a path, that’s for sure.”
Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him .
Mandri said, “Do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to learn to draw hands,” said Vigram, smiling.
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. He hadn’t even tried to draw Ora’s fingers. They were chicken scratches.
“If you aren’t going take what I say to heart, then what’s the point of me coming here?”
“I’m sorry, Mandri, but hands are too hard to paint. If a hand had one or two fingers it’d be a different matter entirely. As it is, they’re difficult things to draw.”
“But you can think of it as having three fingers. The middle two share a tendon so the tend to move together.”
“Yeah, but then there’s the thumb, too. The whole thing is just too weird.”
“Vigram, if you truly want to get better, you have to try, and when it comes to painting, ‘trying’ means putting in the time and effort to learn how to draw hands.”
“I know, I know.”
“The only things that matter are the face and the hands. You could give Ora forty ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
“You say that, but I feel like next time I come over you won’t have drawn a single hand.”
“Probably.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time—or it would be if there weren’t burgeons at the end of it.
And almost stepped on the toes of on of Vigram’s soldiers as marched on into the patio.
“Sorry to interrupt, my lord.”
“What is it?” Vigram asked.
“The young master’s ox is eating the apples.”
The soldier pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines. Some twenty meters away was Mandri’s yellow ox, named Gil. Gil was was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, trying in vain to lick the apple off its stem for the apple was little too high up. All his tongue was doing was batting the unripe fruit around.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said firmly. “He’s as much a human being as you or I.”
“Hah!”
“It’s true. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil and shouted, “Gil! Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. He stared back through the vines with that dumb, bovine ogle as the slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. 
“Gil!”
Gil blinked.
Then he got distracted by the healthy grass below him. He bit off a mouthful and started chewing.
“Gil!”
Gil looked up again.
Blinked again.
A second later, and he was trotting towards the patio, dewflap flapping, his short-hair hide rolling over his pitiful ribs.
“Poor old creature,” Vigram muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said.
Gill clopped into the patio as if it were his living room.
Ora slid off her chair and hurried behind Mandri and Vigram.
Then the soldier lowered his spear.
“Woah, Woah, woah!” Mandri exclaimed as he pushed the spearhead away. “Relax!”
Vigram nodded to the soldier and said, “Thank you, you’re dismissed.”
The soldier spun on his heel, more in imitation of professional discipline than the real thing. Mandri stared daggers into his back as he left.
“If he pricked Gil I’d have him up for attempted murder.”
Gill nuzzled up against Mandri’s shoulder.
Vigram eyed the beast with some. “If Gil was eating my apples, I could have him up for thievery.”
“Oh, please,” said Mandri. “Gil’s the nicest old ox you’ll ever meet. Watch this,” Mandri presented Vigram’s painting to Gil with a flourish, then asked his ox, “What do you think of Viggi’s painting?”
Gill looked at it.
He gave his grass a chew.
Then he mooed. 
“See!?” Mandri exclaimed.
“See what?” Vigram asked.
“He likes it.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
Ora sauntered over to Gil and scratched him into a cooing moo.
She said, “He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is.”
Vigram said to Ora, “What do you think of my painting?”
Ora eyed the painting with some suspicion that quickly morphed into a stifled laugh.
“It’s not that bad, is it? Ora, I’ll have your honest opinion.”
“It looks like a demon.”
Vigram’s brow nit tight and leaned back yet again study the face he’d painted. 
“Yes, you do look disturbed, don’t you.”
“Maybe it’s the hands. They look like claws.”
Vigram’s shoulders slumped in defeat. “I can’t paint hands! I haven’t got the dexterity.”
“The dexterity?”
“Painting hands feels like needlework. Especially when I use this tiny brush. I don’t have the dexterity for it.” Vigram held up a brush with thin, only a few horse-hairs wide. 
Ora leaned into Mandri and said, “An artist needs strong and dexterous hands, don’t they?” 
Mandri’s face lit up like he’d just been punched in the gut. So , but the man was smiling like he was about to stamp a return on interest. 
Mandri said, “Uh…No… well yes, but I don’t have any, uh, dexterity. I haven’t painted a portrait in more than two years.”
“Really?” said Vigram. “Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
Vigram rolled his eyes and shared a with Ora. It was common knowledge that Mandri’s farm couldn’t grow a weed.
“Right,” said Vigram as he clapped his hands. “Time for lunch. I’ll come and get you two when it’s ready.” With that, he stomped his way into his villa’s anteroom, leaving Mandri alone with Ora and Gil.
“Why don’t you paint anymore?” Ora asked.
“Uh…it would be too hard to explain.”
“Try.”
“Well, painting is, uh…to put it simply, it’s too much work.”
“Wouldn’t that be the artist’s fault?”
“No. Look. There’s not a…” Mandri tried to think of a more palatable excuse, and he found it when he picked up Vigram’s muddy pallette. “It’s expensive to paint. I mean look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it’d take me a year to afford all this. Your father makes this in a week.”
“You could that much too if you worked for him.”
“That’s not happening.”
“You’d barely have to do more than sign a scrap of paper every now and then.”
He’d stumbled into a trap.
“Look, Ora, I’m just here to teach.”
“Are you dense?”
“No?”
“My dad doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for the lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t.”
“Is that how he feels about it?”
“Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. He’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”
“It is too. I have an ox! It’s a farm. Isn’t that right, Gil?”
Gil had already clopped off and was back to licking at that apple.
Mandri was alone.
She set her hands on her hips and said, “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“Excuse me—what?”
“They say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch.”
“Couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
Mandri almost dropped the paints onto the brick.
“You want me to bare myself?”
Ora crossed her arms and gave Mandri an expectant look.
Mandri recoiled . “I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
“Why not?”
“Why not?!”
“I’m a woman, Mandri. What’s your problem?”
Mandri was too thin to absorb the shock of such bluntness. by squishing up his face and pretended like he had no idea what she was talking about. But Oya was a girl who had no patience for 
“Ora…” 
He had to be very careful here.
“You’re a beautiful girl, but-”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No!—no. I’m not fit for a married life.”
“I could be good for you.”
“And what do you get out of it?”
“You could be good for me.”
She. Mandri had to 
“You would not say that if you knew me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
Had to bite down to hide his contempt.
“Yeap. Look…”
Building to a head.
“What is wrong with you?”
“See that’s what I’m talking about! This is what I’m talking about!”
But stopped when he realized he was forgetting something.
“Gil!”
But Gil was already trotting down villa’s gentle hill towards Mandri. Together they walked down to Vigram’s swing gate.
“Mandri! Stop!”
Vigram was running down his thoroughfare. The old man had to keep his beard tucked under his arm lest it fly up and bother his face.
Vigram arrived out of breath. He had to rest for half a moment against the fence post before speaking.
“What did you say to Ora? You’ve got her in a dizz.”
“I barely said anything. I just walked away.”
“You walked away?”
Mandri shrugged.
“What’s going on, Mandri? Is Ora not a beautiful girl?”
“She is, but Vigram, I’m not interested.”
“She could be good for you.”
Mandri laughed.
“Alright. I am leaving now.”
“No you aren’t. You can’t leave until I pay you.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
“Mandri, it’s my job to worry about on-time payment.”
Vigram reached into a fold in his robe and pulled out a small sack of coin. It was fatter than usual.
“Take it,” he said. When Mandri hesitated, he added, “I will get upset if you do not take this money.”
“Okay, fine.”
The bag slapped Mandri’s palm, but Vigram jerked it away. He wagged his finger in Mandri’s nose and said, “I want you to promise me you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“Burgeons?”
“Please, Mandri, I’m not a fool. I know you’ve been buying burgeons from Geem.”
“I haven’t.”
Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, “I’m going to give you this money, but don’t go and use it to buy more burgeons. Buy some apples for old Gil here.”
“I will.”
Vigram put the coin back in Mandri’s hand, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.
“You’ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. Don’t smile, I’m serious. Solraheen’s given you a gift. It’s a sacred gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later, Viggi.”
Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. 
“I’m serious!” said Vigram. “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift. Not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but everyone would be less impressed if they saw him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he’d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. People only ever saw was the finished product, those twenty-four strokes and they assumed that Mandri’s brush went slip-slap-boom and there’s a true likeness. Couldn’t be further from the truth. Mandri’s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and he suspected that’s all a talented mind was—a mind inexplicably immune to hard work and drudgery. It’s something a person can lose. Mandri was living proof. 
When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram’s villa, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. Vigram waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons, Mandri!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
“They’re gonna fry your spark!”
Mandri wasn’t about to get into an argument at that kind of distance, so he waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle, so the insides had a tendency to dry out too quick for Mandri’s liking. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. 
Then Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back Mandri’s dust bowl of a farm. </Text>

The heat is like an iron weight, radiating back from teh ground, creating little eddies of convection turbulince, like sitting on a grill beneath a toaster. 

Petrified forest half-smothered in sand.
Sand as fine as flour, drifts through the camp and overhead, turning the sky a hazy yellow and blurring the sun.

Interesting scene there in the beginning. Nomads passing through camp, shuffle through the blur back out into the emptiness. People huddled against the sand. Low visibilty. People march through. High tension.

Romantic notions of plunging into the desert.
All of this is outsider thinking,. People who have gone into the deseret as a challenge or an adventure, or as a prospector, or simply to seek solace in a place as remote and empty and perilous as it is possible to be, hoping to find their center by becoming lost in the eternal, hoping, perhaps, that the soul can be healed there, in a place where it must perfroce contemplate only the starkest of choice. 
It’s also outsider thinking to talk of the pitiless sun, to impute malevolence to the waves of heat. It is not pitiless, it just is. Yes it will kill you if you’re careless. It is unremarkable. 

This may seem like the end of the earth to you, but it is not for us…. In the desert we are free; there are no restrictions. We can see forever. We can cast our eyes to the horizon, and all we can see is sand and sky. In the desert, our spirits can fly. 

“Allah removed all surplus human and animal life from the desert so that there might be one place for him to walk in peace… and so it is called the garden of allah.”

Some time in the first centuries of the present era - even speculative dates are hard to come by - 

Capital of mauritania, Noukchott.

The Funj people were neither Arab nor Muslim, and except for the fact that they migrated down the blue nile, their origin is not known.

Tuareg and tubu nomads were ungoverned and ungovernable

Lord kitchener finally put paid to him, with immense slaughter and a considerable degree of imperial callousness. It was later reported that he used the mahdi’s skull as an inkstand, but the queen professed herself shocked and the skull was decently buried at wadi halfa.

Traveler joining ‘to see what’s on the other side’

First to penetrate the sahara and leave a detailed account of his journeys, was Ibn Battuta, or, as he’s styled with admirable precision in a fifteenth century arabic dictonary of eminent persons, “Muhammad b. Abdullah b.Muhammad b. Ibrahim b. Muhammad b. Ibrahaim b. Yusuf, of the tribe of luwata and the city of tanja.

He was born, we knokw, in tangier in 1304 to a family of scholars and lawyers, and went to mecca for his pilgrimage at the age of twenty-one. There he determined “to travel throughout the earth”
Basic rule “never so far as is possible, to cover a second time any road”. Marrying, along the way, countless wives.

He visited arabia, india, and china and traveled down africa’s east coast, possibly as far as modern mozambique. He twice crossed the Sahara to Niger and beyond.

The urge to explore - the urge to tidy up the chaotic unkown, to extend the borders of the knkown.

Dutchwoman explorer Alexine tinne, who had her arm hacked off by one of her tuareg escorts and was left to blled to death in the Libyan sand. Her caravan advanced slowly. Due to her diseases (attacks of gout and inflammation of her eyes), she was not able to maintain order in her group.  who visited the same area in the 1870s, met participants of the assault and learned that it had been a blow against the &quot;great old man&quot; of the Northern Tuaregs, Ikhenukhen, who was to be removed from his powerful position, and the means was to be the killing of the Christians—just to prove that Ikhenukhen was too weak to protect travelers 

The huge sand seas of mauritania, mali, separated by the assifs of the central sahara. There are mountains parallel to the north coast and in the center; the desert ends, west and east, in clifs along the atlantica nd the red sea. Long-vanished watercourses lie in patterns like lace over the whole, and there are huge salt flats whwere lakes had once been. These are the boundaries that the nomads of the desert follow, boundaries imposed by nature, dictated by subterranean water and not by police posts, by passages through the massifs and not by national frontiers, by the endurance of camels and not by the edicts of parliaments.

Five deserts of leo africanus

Archibald robbins, an  american mariner shipwrecked on the shore in the early nineteenth century and enslaved by a ragtag band of moorish nomads, later descibed his first sight of cape barbas, western sahara. After his party picked themselves up from the beach,”we soon began to ascend… we at length ascended the top of the precipice, and O merciful Heaven! What a prospect presented itself to our affrighted view! What despondency sunk into our hearts! Cast upon a barren heath, a boundles plain, made up of burning sand and flinty stones, producing neither a gree nvegetable, or refreshing; there to be famished with hunger, devoured by wild beasts, or become slaves to the most merciless of creatures that wear the form of man.

Dune cover almost half of mauritania and most of western shara, many of them a score of miles long, in long ridges, often three hundred or four hundred feet high. They butt an d intersect and overlap in complex patterns, a network of ridges and dips, crescents and curls, that from above resmeble the whorls of gigantic fingerprints. The central plateaus are cut by a network of wadis and drainage basins locally called gueltas. 

A rugged landscape of deep gorges and sheer cliff-edged mesas, softened by gently rolling dunes, scalloped and rippled, enfolding the upthrust spears of volcanic rock, a rich palette of golds and browns.  Tucked up against these cliffs are oases that nourished medieval trading cities.

Immense ledges of white marble, cut straight and square, as though ramparts for a castle.

God willing - they say, but their white knuckles and terrified expressions were not reassuring.

Mali’s landscape is flat and mononotous to the north, riven with gullies and sandstone liffs to the south, where the dogon people a thousand years ago took refuge from invaders, buried their dead in high caves in the sheer cleiffs where they couldn’t be disturbed by marauding armies.

A deeply eroded sandstone massif, barren and scrubbed by the wind, pressed in by the tanezrouft and the chech, great ergs, shifting seas of dunes.

The tuareg won’t travel with the moon except in dire necessity; they pitch their tents in the oonlight, they make music against the malign spirits and demons of the night, and sometimes they dance, but often they withdrawinto silence, goatskin cloaks wrapped around them, and wait for dawn.

Some travelers have called tenere, in central niger, the Land of Fear, though this is at best an uncertain translation from the tamashek, the spoken language of the tuareg ( others have said tenere really means nothing, but some suspect that it doesnt mean nothing - it just doesn’t mean anything.



Caillie remembered being first to have visited timbuktu and returned unscathed

Alexander gordon laing, explorer who met a treacherous end near timbuktu in 1825 - libya - “forlorn, black-looking plains;the eye of the travleler roams in vain over the wide, unvarying superficies, in search of some object to rest on, till at length, wearied by the bleak and tedious sameness, he is willing to pull the folds of his turban over his eyes and to shroud his head in a burnoosa.

Leo africanus - the people there are black, vile and covetous, yet exceedingly rich.

Egyptians rapidly running out of water of their own. South, the sudd marshes of sudan, hold extraordinary amount of water. Training them, by some measure, would each year add almost a billion cubic meters of water to the nile.sudan, not surprisingly, is vigorously resisting this notion.

Bubble rocks in sand dunes - curiously, craters and even small hills are found in various places that consist entirely of small round stone balls the size of peaches, ‘as nearly golbular as anything in nature - a bubble, a drop, a planet. They must be cemented with some tough ingredients, as they were excessively hard to break.”

Dead green - serpentine marble


Dig a shovel down into the soil, a yard, two yards, maybe more, and there they are, looking no different form earthworms anywehere else, six or eight inches long, dirty red in color, slimy to the look and touch, unprepossessing and unlovely. To farmers and gardners and to ecologists and the ecologically correct, theyre the preeminent symbol of an ecosystem’s health. Judge the fertility of local soil by the number of earthwormo casts to be found in it. Earthworms aerate teh woil, bring it nutrients, prepare it for planting.

Geologically, the entire desert sits on the african shield, bare and intricately folded pre-cambrian crystallinerock. This shiled has remained stable throug hmany geological epochs. About 580 million years ago, this stability was rudely (if briefly, in geological time) interrupted by the socalled pan-african episode, a violent twisting of the continent’s surface, caused by tectonic plates colliding. Its effects were startling, long north-south folds in the continental structure, including two in the sahara: the dahomey-aggar belt between ghana and algeria, and the mauritanide belt from senegal to morrocco.

It is said that the gold of old ghana once stuck up out of the ground in large rods or spikes, there for the taking.

And tehre is salt. The trade in salt kept the caravans moving long after the gold and then the slaves had diminshed. 

Caravan from oasis to oasis through the stony regs

Remnants of petrified tree trunks, as thick as boulders in places, some several feet across but mostly splintered into smaller fragments of light brown stone. All over the desert, these melancholy relics are stood on their ends by the tuareg as trail or water markers, generally treated with casual contempt; pieces are chipped away to give as souvenirs.

Reeds and grasses petrified too: around many of the salt pans that were once lakes, particularly in teh souther sahara,are curious calcified reeds, looking oddly glasslike and resembling nothing more than tiny ventilation shafts,marking out the former extent of now vanished lakes.

Every depression in the desert has its store of shells, stirred to the surface by the shifting winds.

Slouched about, disconsolate, kicking up the sand when his boot hit a hard black stone, the size of a man’s fist, a sort of molded rock lava incredibly present on the surface of a bed of shells a thousand feet deep.

Deposits of travertine, presence of soils thaf rom under tropical conditions, rock weathering requiring standing pools of water, vast dune areas that were once fixed in place by vegetation, alluvial deposits interpreted in terms of climatic change. 

Desertification - as vegetation is stripped from the land, the surface dries out and reflects more of the sun’s heat. This conditino in turn alters the thermal dynamics of the atmosphere in ways that suppress rainfall. Incresased dust( itself a product of desertification) or other atmospheric pollutants are causing changes in the climate. Desertification results in declining water tables and the salination of topsoil and the remaining water. Increased erotion and the extinction of vegtation make that climate drier.

Population growth, the engine of all increased resource demands, is at the heart of the desertification problem. More people, means more animals and more vegetation cut for fuel and construction. The additional herds needed by greater numbers of humans trample and compact thes oil, reducing the infiltration of the little water that exists, causing erosion and damaged soil. In the sahel, humans have come to use cattle dung as a source of fuel, but even so what sparse vegetation remains is being hacked back for kindling. 

Petrified wood - botanists call it a pseudomorph, where the natural wood fibers are replaced by silicon dioxide or by what is called cryptocrystalline quartz, or chalcedony. The process involves the trees imbibing solutions containing silica, presumably from alkaline-saturated water; the mimicry is so accurate that the original cell structure can be determined after transformation is complete.


It was easy to imagine, in the steely sun of midmorning, that the sand had advanced, had crept farther into town. It crunched underfoot on the packed-earth walkway; there were little eddies in the el made by the house and the public bake oven to the left, already smoldering with a small fire of camel dung this early in the day. A  probing finger of sand crept under the curtain serving as the house’s front door, pushing for the center of the room , and there was more sand on the sills. In the road, if the sand was deeper by an inch or two, it wasn’t immediately obvious as the roads are made of sand in any case.
	Down the street to the east, toward the edge of town and the desert beyond, the stubby square that served as the minaret of the mosque, or what had been the last of the town’s three mosques, still peeped from teh sand, an incngruous sight, a massive building drowned in sand.

Sand attracts sand. It’s how dunes are made - a little patch makes a bigger patch, the patch makes a mound and the mound a hill. In a short while, after a few years in which the townsfolk struggled to keep the growing things alive, most of the the trees in the oasis were engulfed, the wells had to be deepened, the shifting sand making for perilous digging. 

Cities lost in the sand. Armies lost in the sands. On such is the story of Dhu’l-Adhar, “ a king of yemen at about the time of solomon” - who raided the Magreb and forced it into submission. 

The arabic word, Sahra, which simply means desert, derived in turn from the Tamashek Sahar, which means “ sand alone, without stones, rocks, or water, with a smooth horion and no permanent paths.” Other Tuareg gradations include ghrud, dunes and sand hills of whatever height; serir, plains of gravel, whether rounded, sharp or polished; warr, a rough plain with some boulders, hatia, implying places of potential fertility, with scrub bushes and grasses, on which a camel may survive;  wishek, sand hills or plains, productive area no infertile; ghraba, date groves with no town attached; subkhar, salt plains, usually hard as a stone; wadi, a valley in which shrubs grow and in which, when the rains come toorents may rush, and jebel, which defines a stone mountain or mountain range.
	Most of the regs are plain beyond belief, without color, without any memorable feature whatever, it is quite possible to wake up in the morning, travel all day, camp, wake up the next morning, repeat the previous day, and all the while to have seen neigher a tree, nor a shrub, nor a blade of grass, nor a boulder of any sie, nor hill or mountain or mesa, nor wadi, nor well - to have seen, in point of fact, precisely nothing but a flat gravel plain. It is peopled with djinns, the spirits who embody nothingness , whose only sound is a moan and whose dominant characteristic is malice.

Golden dunes are streaked with reds and browns of a startling intensity. Classic dunes the color of caramel, massive sand hills three hundred feet high and miles long, the color of a delicate pink rose. The sands of nothingness stretch toward the ancient salt mines at bilma; some have called them the most beautiful dunes in the desert, golden and gorgeious, deep and deadly.

How quickly the dunes move! One day there’s nothing much, the plain bare and scrubbed, barren soil, thorns, broken stone, gravel, ocher and dun, shimmering in the incandescent desert heat. Then just a few weeks later, there it is - a full-fledged dune the color of honey, sculpted by the wind into ruffles and flutes, a knife edge to leeward, fifty, eighty, a hundred feet high. 
Dunes form in a bewildering variety of shapes- tied dunes, which form in the lee of hills; echo dunes, which appear windward of other dunes; barchans, which are shaped like crescents; and seifs, which are sharp-edged and sinuous, meandering, and often isolated on larger sand sheets. Parabolic blowout dunes, transverse dunes, shifting shapes associated with the sand seas, sigmoidal dunes, pyramidal dunes, domes, star shaped dunes.  Giant sand mountains of sixteen hundred feet or more, mountains with hills of their own on their slippery backs.

When dunes are massive the shifting sand creates an eerily evocative hissing, atnight when the desert air is sweet and still. 
The sand accumulates, but first it chokes and stifles, and makes men feverish, as claustrophobic as miners at a eep seam. In a high wind, the dunes smoke and alow-prichted drumming is heard, the spirit of Raoul, the Drummer of Death, and the Tuareg draw theirveils across their faces, and cast their eyes downward. 
The drumming is the avalanching of billions of tiny grains slowing as they reache the bottom of the slip face,

Since the 13th century, records have revealed a unique sound in the desert. A hum or perhaps a groan. Some even say it sounds like an airplane. Yet there is nothing in the sky. And the noise cannot be heard in the dunes either. So who is singing in the sand? The noise cannot simply be dismissed as an auditory mirage, it is much too loud for that. In recent years, sounds measuring 100 decibels have even been recorded. So are there ghosts in the desert? Demons in the dunes? Naturally, that’s how people came to explain the phenomenon—telling passionate and dramatic tales of these strange events. The legends are much the same, and pertain not only to the Sahara, but also to the Gobi and Namib deserts. Even in smaller regions, the phenomenon still occurs today.
The secret to this auditory mystery lies in the avalanches. A discovery which was only made recently. It was just a few years ago when the Laboratory for Physical Statistics in Paris presented their research results—and even managed to “recreate” the sound. But in order to understand the sound, they first had to simulate how a desert avalanche is actually structured. It consists of up to 500 layers with a thickness of approximately ten centimeters. These layers slide down the dune one after the other, creating air cushions. The weight of the avalanche then eventually pushes the pent-up air outwards, causing vibrations. If we imagine these vibrations magnified 500 times, it is no wonder that the sound becomes almost demonic. Almost threatening. A gruesome song that echoes through the dunes.



Dunes move not by drifting but by jumping. When the tiny sand grains, skitter acoss the sere landscape they do so not in fluid motion, in straight lines, bu in little hops. They don’t roll, or slide. They skip, cause ricochets, jump. Called saltation.

If the conditions are right, the dune will grow very rapidly; in days it will be taller than a man, and in just a few weeks it can reach sixty-five or one hundred feet, and keep growing. Over time, the windward slope eventually adjusts itself. 

A nagging question for some days had been how they, the caravanniers heading out to the salt mines at bilma, in eastern niger, navigated across featureless wastelands, with each horion of dunes apparently identical to the hundreds that went before and the many hundreds to follow. Perhaps an answer lay in these ripples?
A’Yoba grinned, delighting in the less. “It means nothing, “ he said, you can learn nothing from it. The movement is random. Whenthe wind gets up , and a storm is coming, the ripples disappear, the surface becomes smooth, the visibility diminishes. But we don’t need tiny signals to tell us a storm is on the way.. It is already obvious.
	Entire dunes migrate downwind, but winds are necessarily variable. There are generally prevailing winds, but in the course of a year, the dunes may shift in several directions. They will move, but they also might grow, or diminish, be absorbed into others, disappear entirely. Dunes will move but dune patches will tend, he said, to stay in more or less the same place, withi a few dozens of miles. The ergs, teh sand seas, don’t move. Only the dunes.
	Like swells in an ocean.

Fermented palm juice.

Many of the winds are hated and feared, and every oneof those has a name.

The dry south winds that carry the glowering towers of dust are known as the ghibli, chili, samun, jefhya, and irifi. The ghibli is bad, and can seem never ending. In the fezzan of southwest libya, the camel-masters say that if the ghibli blows forty days, god preserve us from the evil! The camel becomes pregnant without the intervention of the male. 
The sky appears of a dusky yellow and the sun is barely perceptible. The eyes become red, swelled and inflamed, the lips and skin parched and chapped, while sever pain the chest is invariably felt in consequence of the quantities of sand unavoidably inhaled. 

The harmattan which blows northa nd west, is the worst the driest hottest, most enervating of all. Known as shai-halad, the mother of storms. In teh north african campaign of ww2,. Gales of ninety miles an hour.
	It strips the air of moisture. Humiidity falls from 80 to 10 percent within hours. When the gale is in full cry, visibility is reduced to a few yards. Sand penetrates everything. Grit in food, grit in water (milky grit) , grit on the shets. If you close the windows, the temperature can climb steadily and reach 120, 125 degrees, when the air sears the lungs.
	Sandstorms can be black as night or a lurid yellow or a bleak greay the color of old ash. They may hiss or roar, rumble like thunder; the air is oven hot and crackles with static and a hand run ofver a canvas tent pops and sparks like methane breath on a smoldering coal tip; nerve-ends tingle with electricity and firefly sparks jump and snap. The camles squat in teh sand, their backs to the wind, and close their long-lashed and double lidded eyes.
A static charge in the air. Everything sparks. Dog Cant be stroked without producing crackling sparks.

In a wadi in the tenere, a shallow well had been dug. Nearby was a young woman in a black robe, black aba hood over her head. She herself was small and black with a toothless smile, bold eyes, legs stringy with musle, bare feet. She had two small children with her, but they ket their distance, wary of strangers. 

Only then did she offer the children a few sips from the can, and lastly she herself drank, but sparingly. To drink too much or more than you need is anathema.

Like most wadis, this one was broad flat, sandy, with occasional acacias rooted in the sand, their leaves torn and tattered from rasping goat and camel tongues. The river that had once run here would have been placid, slow moving, and the well was almost in the center of what would have been its course. It was only four or five feet deep, but there was better than six inches of water at the bottom. It was kept from collapsing in onitself with a crude bracing of acacia branches, but in a week or so it would fill in anyway, and need to be reopened. The young woman offered her visitors a can. The water was clear, a change from the saharan standards, and had a slight metallic taste from the can. 

When asked why they hadn’t camped closer to the well, she shrugged. To walk a mile or two to the well with the goats helped fill up the day. 

If it hardly rains, and there are no perennial rivers, where does this water come from? 

A thredony of anxiety that permeates decisions.
A threnody.


If one were somehow able to see through the desert sand and its underlying rock, and if somehow in this magical lens water was t oappear in brilliant color against the underlying dun, one would see a complicated, slender, three-dimensional lattice of blue, in some places shifting and changing with the seasons, in others remaining stable for geological epochs. At times there would be splashes of blue underneath ancient river courses and wadis, shallow, erratic, spiky with endless branches and tributaries, with neither beginning nor end, dependent on ancient drainage systems but no longer containing enough moisture to reach the oceans or any other outlet. Someo f these would be permanent water, shallow but not transitory, left over from earlier epochs… sometimes there would be vertical ‘pipes’ of emerald, dropping through fractures in the crust to pools of water lying on the impermeable layers below; some would go down a hundred feet, some many thousands; some would be a sliver wide, other doezens of yards. And in places, very deep down, in the permeable sandstone laid down on the oldest rocks, would be virtual seas of blue, the size of the american great lakes. These are the nubian sandstone aquifer and the other great reservoirs that underlie so much of north and central sahara. They are ‘fossil aquifers’, so clled because they were filled with water in earlier epochs.

In the sahara, where the aquifers are not being replenished, or are being replenished very slowly, the water table is often thousands of feet down. In most of the sahara, where no permeable rocks exist, there is no water table at all. In other places, such as in the oases that make desert life possible, there are artesian ‘springs’, which are really just water being pushed up through natural fissures in the rock from confined aquifers that are under hydraulic pressure. These aquifers, then are not pools or lakes of water in the conventional sense - even if you could somehow reach them you could not swim in them - but merely supersaturated porous rock and gravel, charged in earlier geological epochs. Wells drilled into the aquifer work by creating open spaces into which the water from the surrounding rock can flow, and from which it can then be pumped. 

There are even fish, deep beneath the desert sands. In the middle years of the last century the french academician jacquess couelle dug a well in the desert near el-golea, south of the western great erg, and at 130 feet his men struck water, brackish and churning, but water nevertheless. The next day the crew returned with baskets and found themselves pulling out fish, “completely blind, with only a membrane where there used tobe eyes; they ahve reproduced, survivng more than 100000 years. There were hundreds of thousands of htem. We cooked some of them and they were delicious.”

In the very largest dunes, rare ‘seeps’ can be found, the sand weeping water, though the surrounding desert floor is dry to a depth of many feet. If you know what you’re doing, even in the deep desert you candig down a yard or so in the dunes and press moisture from the sand.
However, it is never enough to live on. Many a traveler has sucked damp sand, but died of thirst nonetheless.

Spring fed saline lakes - Mavo Lake changes color -sometimes water is blue, green adn sometimes a striking red. When it is pink, it is because it is tinged with billions of timy shriplike creatures known as doud, arabic for worm. The people who live around its shores are known as dauda, which means wormers.
Lake gabraoun is as salty as the dead sea, but if you dig a shallow pit, even a few feet from the lake’s edge, it fills with freshwater.date palms and reeds thrive on its shores.

On the north side below the bank a black substance like mineral tar oozes into the water, and a crust of salt forms on the top like half-thawed ice. Natron forms in cakes at the bottom; the local people use it for tanning, for baking unleavened bread, as an animal feed, and to mix with pipe tobacco, among other things. 

The great lake chad, glowing with the golden rays of the sun… on theh shores there were prosperous little villges, most houses having a cow or two, some goats, and chickens int he yard and the lake itself was thronged with birds and animals. All was not so peaceful, for the villages were subject to constant raids… piratical buduma, warlike people who inhabited the islands of lake chad and controlled the waters from their battle canoes.

            <Title>Setting Out</Title>
            <Text>
Mandri tried fighting, he tried running away, he even tried dying - none of it worked. No matter what he did, he couldn’t get away from well-adjusted people. Now here he was, shouldering a knobby sack of stuff that wasn’t his on a forsaken road some inestimable distance away from civilization, and there was Moto Mundi, striding alongside him. And Moto wasn’t just a well-adjusted person, he was good-and-well-adjusted. There’s a difference. It’s worse.
All the other Ayramun were oddballs. Moto’s sister, Moteah, was well-adjusted too, but Mandri liked to look at her so he gave her a pass. So in effect there was just one person amongst the thirteen Ayramun that Mandri knew he wouldn’t like. There was a decent chance Mandri he wouldn’t like any of the Ayramun once he got to know them, but Moto, that was a man that Mandri could hate on principle. That principle being, of course, that well-adjusted people are assholes.
The signs were there on the surface, with Moto’s flawless black skin, his clean and even features, his chiseled jaw, his height, his broad shoulders, his bird-bright eyes looking at the world like it’s just a game. Even when standing still he was dynamic, a slight swerve of coiled strength like the muscled statues of Zos - firmly fixed in granite yet about to burst into action. And is garb was disgustingly fashionable, tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. The dress was an affront to the struggle for survival out in the desert. Everyone else was done up in rags by comparison (excepting Moteah). Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. 
The sum of the effort put into his appearance might lead one to believe that Moto cared what other people thought of him, and if that were the case Mandri might have been able to stand him. No, Moto was well-adjusted, and well-adjusted people don’t really consider others to be sentient beings - that’s what makes them well-adjusted. If you take other people’s feelings into consideration, or how they might be judging you, well that leads to doubt, and that leads to indecision, and snip-snap it becomes a habit, leaving one anxious, uneasy, and more to the point, having to adjust themselves. As far as Mandri was concerned, that’s where empathy leads, it leads to a vicious, unceasing cycle of adjustment and so a well-adjusted person, by definition, lacks empathy, meaning they’re all assholes. So, Moto looked the way he did for no other reason than because it pleased him, and that made him an asshole. Well, it didn’t make him an asshole - it was a sign. Most people who look so pretty are only pretending to be well-adjusted. Mandri knew Moto was the real thing because of how he laughed.
The two were walking side by side and Mandri said out loud that he wondered where they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. Mandri didn’t see any road, so he asked, “What road?”, and then Moto laughed.
Laughs come in infinite flavors so they can be hard to place. This laugh was one that Mandri had a special sensitivity to. It was the laugh of someone who’s well-adjusted laughing at someone who’s not. It comes with a twinge of disbelief. There’s a note of derision. Not necessarily loud, it’s a simple, lively, full-bodied, challenging,“Hah!” that leaves a bitter afterthought. Mandri would have preferred Moto to just say you’re-out-of-place and be done with it.
Moto then turned that twinge of disbelief into a question. “You’re saying you don’t know about charnel roads?” 
Mandri didn’t answer. He kept his eyes down, hoping the Moto might go silent as well.
“This is the Bazul Road,” Moto said.
Mandri only saw dirt. He looked forward, left and right, and there was more dirt. Yes, roads were made of dirt, but they had sides to them, or at least a waystone, or wheelruts - some sign of a thing passing through. Even lizard trails through shrubby brush carved clearly defined paths where green things didn’t grow. There was none of that here. You had step over the little grey shrubs, you had to walk around sunken pits of clay. The only thing that suggested a road were the tracks of the Ayramun who were walking ahead of him.
“I don’t see it,” Mandri said.
“Of course you don’t see it,” Moto answered. “You don’t know what to look for. But it’s here. The whole Sand is webbed by charnel roads just like this one.” Moto kicked the ground, as if doing so made the road’s existence more believable. Mandri began to wonder if Moto was trying to put him up and make him look a fool.
“They’re ancient things,” Moto said. “Let me ask you, if you had to build a road in a rainy place, how would you build it?
“What do you mean by ‘a rainy place’?”
“Used to rain here when this road was built.”
“How long ago was that?”
“Just answer the question. If you had to build a road in a rainy place, how would you build it?”
“I guess I don’t know.”
Moto clicked his tongue in disgust. “If I ask you a question at least try to answer it.”
“I really don’t know.”
“‘I don’t know. I don’t know.’Give it some thought. Think. Do you a think?”
“Of course I think.”
“Then look like it, cause you look dumb. You looking like it hurts to think.”
Mandri shrugged.
“I told you everything you need to know to be able to see the road, so look for the road.”
Mandri saw the road almost immediately but didn’t want to give Moto the satisfaction of having shown him something, so the two walked on in silence for a finger as Mandri pretended to look for a clue. But it was there, the Bazul Road. It was the gentlest raised hump of earth and it snaked on ahead into the distance; a slope so slight and obscured by brush that it was easy to miss, and it was wide, at least twelve men across, so wide that it was easy to mistake for a natural deposit of dirt blown in from one of the Hazisads, one of the sandstorms which the heat whips up in the summer and spins aimlessly in the Sand for weeks. Mandri thought that a natural explanation like a storm was a much more reasonable explanation for this ‘road’. It was just too big, and went on too far. More likely it was the result of some tectonic shift of rock than mere men slaving away. 
Mandri wasn’t about to voice his opinion, though. Instead he furrowed his brow, looked at nothing in particular, scratched his chin and took as much pleasure as he could in the mild anticipation building in Moto’s stare before finally shrugging and saying, “I don’t see it.”
The tall Zosan recoiled in shock.
“Are you dumb?” Moto asked.
The bluntness of it made Mandri laugh. That tapered off when as soon as Mandri realized that Moto was serious. The man really thought he was dumb.
“I’m not dumb. I just don’t - what does it matter whether or not I can see the road? Is this some kind of test?”
“It wasn’t before, but now it is.”
“Well what does it matter?”
“A man needs to know if his traveling companion is dumb.”
“Why?”
Moto sighed in frustration. 
“Let me start on a different foot here, Mandri: I don’t care about you at all. Ayram has saddled me with the burden of getting to know you, and so here I am.”
“I’m sorry to hear that.”
“You want to know where we’re going? We’re going to a place called Minting Rock. It’s off the road a few leagues north of here. And the road is here. You see its this hump here.” Moto traced the contour with an open hand. “They made it a hump so that water rolls off it. there’s even gutters on the sides if you dig down there. You see there between those hills, that little sump there? The slope that runs between them? Follow that all the way down -“”	“So you say.”
“You don’t believe me?”
“No, I believe you.”
Moto smiled. “It goes further than you’d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?”
“I don’t.”
“Don’t suppose you can figure out why they call them charnel roads?”
“I don’t know what charnel means.”	“Means of place of death.”
“Then I guess it means things die on these roads.”
“You guess?”
“It’s just a figure of speech.”
 “You know the sun can kill you, right?”
“Yeah. But-”
“But what?”
“Can’t people just walk the roads at night?”
Moto raised his arms to the sun revelation, as if a long-awaited answer to a prayer had finally come. He smiled and shouted, “The boy thinks!” A mocking gleam shone out from under his imposing brow, and he said Mandri, “I shall thank Sol that you are not well-and-truly dumb.”
“Oh, so I’m just regular-old-dumb then?”
“That remains to be seen. But what you undeniably are is ignorant.”
“It was an honest question.”
“It was! It is. But you see, it’s not any old thing that dies on a charnel road. It’s pilgrims that die. And as anyone who’s ever spent any time in the Sand knows, pilgrims don’t walk the roads at night because the whole point of walking the road is to suffer.”
“I thought it was to get to where you’re going.”
“See, you’ve never met a pilgrim.”
“Pilgrims don’t go to Meskalem.”
“Ask a pilgrim why he doesn’t make the Bazul Road at night and he’ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn’t have been martyred out in the Sand.”
“I see.”
“If Bazul wanted a pilgrim to lead a life of comfort, then he’d have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. But oh, no! No, no, no! Bazul’s shrine is set deep into the Sand because Bazul deemed it fit to be killed there.”
“Ah,” Mandri muttered. 
It was an indifferent ‘ah’. If Moto were a normal person, an utterance like that would get him to clam up. Not the well-adjusted. Mandri might as well have been a bush rustling its branches. Moto just kept on going.
“Walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. So true Solitant pilgrims don’t trivialize the road by walking it at night. No, no. They trudge along the road in the blaze of day, and sometimes they die doing it.”
“Tragic.”
“Show some respect, boy.”
“Sorry. I’m sorry. I’m just having a hard time. In general I mean. And this damned pack. Heavy as a kumkwat. It’s put me in a mood.”
“You’ve never journeyed outside of Meskalem, have you?”
“Not until recently, no.”
“What are you doing out here in the wilderness if you’ve got no experience with it?”
“You tell me. You guys are the ones who raised me from the dead.”
“I mean before all that. We found you found you murdered in a ravine in the Junei. How did that come to happen?”
“I’d rather not talk about it.”
“I’d like for you to talk about it.”
“Well, I don’t want to.”
“That’s unfortunate, because you’re going to.”
“Is that so?”
“ I’m going to need an answer. What were you doing dead in that ravine?”
“Can I ask a question first?”
“No.”
“Why not?”
“Because.”
“Well why not?”
“I don’t need to give you a reason, just do what you’re asked.”
“Why can’t we have a normal conversation? You ask a question, then I ask a question. Talk about the weather. Why you got to be all, ‘I’m in charge here, I do the asking’?”
 Moto stops walking. Folds his arm. Looks Mandri up and down like he’s seeing a djinn. Mandri felt compelled to stop walking too, like he was tethered to mandri’s stare.
“Mandri, I’ll warn you now and warn you once - there is no place in Ayram’s graces for a scrawny boy who won’t do what he’s asked. I do what Ayram asks me to do. Ayram asks me to find out what you were up to in that ravine, so I am here trying to find out. So you tell me that, and we can get along. ”
“I’ll make deal.”
“Oh?”
“You’re a strong guy. I’m weak. If you carry this sack for me, I’ll tell you anything you want to know.”
Moto shifted his weight forward.
“I get the sense that you haven’t quite grasped the situation here.”
“I don’t. That’s why I want to ask some questions, but you won’t let me. I don’t even know where I am.”
“Where you are is at the end of my patience, and if you need to ask a couple questions to figure that out then you aren’t going to last long out here. We left the last boy who got lippy half buried in a mudpan down in Kokuma.”
“Scary.”
Moto’s hand flicked up then slapped the impertinence out of Mandri’s cheek.

THWACK

 Mandri didn’t see it coming. He was looking right at the man, but didn’t see it coming. Moto was shaking the sting out of his fingers by the time Mandri realized his jaw felt like a wallop. 
An arresting threat in Moto’s eyes rooted Mandri to the spot. 
“You don’t belong out here Mandri. You’re gonna need adjustment.”
 
Adjustment.

What a word to use, adjustment. Moto could have said one of twenty words that mean roughly the same thing, but he didn’t. He could have told Mandri that he ‘needed improvement’, and likely the two would have gone on to trade insults all the way to Minting Rock. The slap, all that did was sting. The sound of the word adjustment whistling out from under Moto’s pampered mustache, well that ripped the lining right out of Mandri’s mind.
Funny how a word could do that, revert a budding man into a child - not even a child, in that moment Mandri was a sense organ, a bundle of light and sound and confusion incapable of comprehending what it was and what was happening to it.  And it wasn’t just the word that did all this, it was the lifetime of indignities that had glommed onto it, a veritable wrecking ball, one his father had been forging for years, ever since the first time he’d caught Mandri’s wrist and told him to stop acting like a fag.
All this, it was a hindrance to living. So, for the second time in as many weeks, Mandri decided to simply stop. He unshouldered his pack, let it hit the ground with a thud, and marched off. 
Moto, ignorant of the explosion he’d just caused, saw saw only disrespect.
“Don’t walk away from me!”
Mandri didn’t answer.
“Actually, you know what, keep walking! Let the sun do the work.”
Mandri only got a few steps away when Moto decided to set out after him. He hadn’t yet learned who’d killed the boy.
“Careful where you step, Mandri. Don’t step right next to a rock that big or you’ll end up with fangs in your ankle.”
Mandri wasn’t even looking at the ground.
Moto put his hand on Mandri’s shoulder. Mandri shrugged it off. There was an energy in his body that Moto felt, and that was something Moto recognized. Electric twitch of an animal, or a man, ready to fight for it’s life.
“You’re gonna die out here.”
“Done it before.”
“But you ain’t just gonna die. This is a charnel road, and you’ve plumped up with water.”
Step step step.	“It could be days before you end up dead. That’s not a good death.”
Step. Step. Step.
“You ever seen what the sun can do to a person? There’s no karkle bushes here for you to hide under. Imagine rubbing your eyes with no moisture in them. Imagine an ache that splits you from your head to your toes, peels open your stomach, gnaws at the marrow in your bones like a fever. All the while your mouth is turning black, drying out, and your tongue swells up to bursting.”
Mandri is getting rigged.
“You ever seen a black tongue the size of a hermit slug?”
“Holy hell, shut up!”	“I haven’t even got to the worst of it. There’s an old pile of pilgrim’s bones not far from here that I could show you. And when you look at those bones you’ll see they’re scattered about and he’s missing a few limbs. That’s because lizards got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you’ll still be alive when they do it.”
“I get it.”
“Ha! I do not think that you do.”
Moto leans in. 
“They just start chewing. A drag-belly’s venom stings worse than fire, and the way it works is they chew the venom into you. They got about a hundred teeth the size of arrowheads . That knife wound there in your chest, it’ll be that pain times a hundred. Times a thousand for the venom. Times twenty more cause a pack of drag-bellies numbers at least twenty. And that’s when you learn how smart a drag-belly can be, because they won’t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible. Keeps the meat fresh. ”
Mandri laying there in a gutter. Gutter used in ancient days to stop the dregs from getting their carts on the road without paying the tolls.
Moto face broke into a smile. 
“I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking you can just kill yourself before any of that happens. But you’re not thinking, thinking. You need to remember what I said earlier about leaving a boy half-buried in a mudpan. Ask yourself why this man named Moto would do a thing like that.”
Moto stood up straight and waited for Mandri to give an answer. It wasn’t a full-wait, it was a half-wait, a token gesture to suggest this was a conversation. As soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead.
“You want a hint? You look like you need a hint. I mean, it’s simple, really. I’ll just tell you. It’s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can’t bash his own brains in. Make the mistake of tying a man’s hands and legs and nothing else, and you know what he’ll do when he gets bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He’ll get on his knees like a groveling postulant, then he’ll bend back, face to the heavens like he’s rapt in prayer - that’s what I thought he was doing - and then he’ll swing forward and smash his head against a rock.”
As Moto said all this, he imitated the action, headbutting the air. 
The jerky movement drew the eye of one of the Ayramun who was walking on down the road. It was Sob.
Sob called out, “Hey Moto!”
Moto twisted around to see Sob and Chopper walking there where he and Mandri had been a moment ago. Sob looked winded. Chopper looked like a pack animal, the bulk of leather and cloth on his back incongruous atop his skinny legs.
Sob shouted, “Ya’ll takin a shit, or what?”
Moto shouted back, “Hey Sob, you got any rope?”
Sob’s bald head gleamed no, but Chopper reached into the amorphous blob of pack on his back and pulled out a length of coiled rope. He held it up against the blue sky.
“Bring it over!” Moto shouted.
Sob upset with Chopper for showing the rope.
Sob said something to Chopper, and the two came running over. When they arrived and saw Mandri lying down in a ditch, Sob laughed.
“What, the boy needs help to pop a squat?”
“Chop?”
“No chop. no chop,” Moto said. “Sob, gimme the rope.”
“What you need the rope for?”
“Mandri here wants to get eaten by lizards.”
“What?”
“Don’t worry about it, just gimme the rope.”
Sob pulled the rope away from Moto’s outstretched hand. He coddled it close to his chest like it was a work of holy scripture.
He asked again, “What you need it for?”
“I want to tie Mandri up to make sure he gets the full experience.”
Sob looked from Moto to Mandri with concern. Mandri thought that concern was for him, but that was dashed as soon as Sob opened his mouth.
“I only just made this rope!”
“Give it here,” said Moto.
“Oh, come on. I been at this thing since we left Urun.”
“Give it here.”
“Use your own rope.”
“I don’t have any.”
“And why is that, huh? Cuz you a lazy, rotten,thieving mooch!  You are overripe, Moto! That’s why!”
“Settle down, Sob. You’ll get it back.”
“I’ll get - I’ll get - I’ll get!” Sob stammered  those words in disbelief. He raised the rope in his clenched fist, knuckles white, and shouted, “You already owe me forty feet!”
“Shut up. Give me the rope.”
Telling Sob to shut up was the surest way to get him riled up, and Moto knew it. Sob knew that Moto knew it. and that made it so much more unbearable. He also knew he couldn’t do anything about it. He had to give him the rope, because Moto’s left hand was resting oh-so-casually on the pommel of his sword. 
Moto saw Sob’s eyes flick to the sword on his hip.
“Please, Sob. We both know I wouldn’t need a weapon to get you to give me that rope.”
Mandri watched as Sob 
With a huff, Sob handed the rope over.
“I’m gonna tell Ayram about this.”
“Be sure that you do.”
“Oh, I will.”
“And tell him where we are. We’ll be here. Might be at one of the lizard pits back by that elbow we just passed.”
With that Sob stomped off in a storm to rival the . Sob casts a ‘lucky’ stone aside.

Moto turned to Chopper.
Chopper asked, “Chop?”
“No chop. Hold the boy still.”


Little bit about pain poking through that frustration.
“Alright. I’ll tell you what you want to know.”
“I haven’t started yet.”
“Just go away.”
“What part of anything I’ve said suggests that I’m going to do that? Why even ask? Think, Mandri, think. Tell me who killed you and why.”
“I said I’ll tell you.”
“Alright then.”
“Can you at least get Chopper’s breath out my face?”
“Chopper, give him some space.”
Chopper backs off.
“So who killed you?”
“I killed me.”
The look of complete disbelief on Moto’s face.
“It’s the truth. I killed myself. I went out into the Junei because I wanted to die.”
“If you killed yourself, then where was the blade?”
“I threw it.”
“You stabbed yourself in the chest, pierced your heart, and then you threw the blade away?”
“Yes.”
Moto look at mandri like he’d seen him for the first time.
“Why’d you do that?”
“Do I need a reason?”
“Were you running from someone?”
“No one in particular.”
“The hell does that mean? You have debts?”
“No. Look, it doesn’t matter. I told you what you want to know.”
“You have done no such thing. I want to know who the hell you are. I want to know precisely why you were out there in the Junei, and I want to know what brought you to kill yourself - if that is indeed what happened.”
“My name is Mandrameen. I was in the Junei because I wanted to die, and I wanted to die because...”
“Yes?”
Mandri fought it impossible to say out loud. There’d be no point. Communication.
“Boy. Out with it. What are you, one of those sad saps who can’t get loving?”
“Something like that.”
“Something like it? Or is that it?”
“I don’t know.”
“Was it a girl?”
“No.”
“Hah! Boy your age gets upset, it’s always a girl.”
“It wasn’t a girl.”
“Sure.”
Mandri shrugged. “Believe what you want.”
“Mandri, a man’s got to have a reason to be sad. See, Chopper gets here sad when you don’t let him chop.”
Chopper, who had been waiting patiently this whole time, perked up at the mention of his favorite word. It reminded him of something - maybe someone needed some chopping. He knew the answer was no, but decided to ask anyways.
“Chop?”
Moto spared a glance for Chopper and said, “No chop.”
Chopper’s heart sank.
“You see?” Moto said, pointing to Chopper with an open hand. “Sadness is cause and effect, like everything else.”
“Why do you care?”
“Again, Mandri, I don’t care. I don’t care about you at all. It is Ayram that cares. He’s going to want to know all about you.”
“Why?”
“So that he can know what to do with you.”
“Gods, just leave me here.”
Moto stood up to his full height.
“Just leave you here, huh? You sound…You sound…” Moto swirled the air with his hand as searched for the right word.
“Jilted. Yes, that’s the right word. Yes. Look at you. A young man, a jilted lover-”
“I’m not a-”
“No doubt born into wealth. I mean look at your frame. You wouldn’t survive in the streets of Meskalem. No, you were a coddled child who didn’t have enough problems to solve and so he made up his own. And that’s it! That’s what’s wrong with you.”
Moto, pleased with himself.
“You suffer from a lack of practical problems. And what luck, here I am!”
“You see, Mandri, I was just like you once, a young man, a jilted lover, mind stuck in the muds of ennui. There is no more fitting person in all the world to cure you of your affliction.”
Moto motions to Chopper. That didn’t get his attention, so he resorted to calling the name.
“Chopper - ”
“Chop?”
“No chop. I want you hold the boy down.”
Chopper holds mandri down.
“Wait! Wait a hair. You said you were going to let me go.”
“When did I say that?”
That got a growl out of Mandri.
“Settle down, boy. This is for your own good.”
“Get your damned hands off me!”
Moto wraps Mandri up. Stuffs a cloth in his mouth.
“If you spit that out, I’m going to have Chopper here take your balls. Got it? Nod if you got it.”
Chopper heard his name said and Mandri was like shit.
He nodded.
“Alright. We’ve got to walk a little ways.”
Went off back the way they had come.
“So , Mandri. Mandri, Mandri, Mandri. Mandrameen. Mandram-een.” Kept saying the name until it became foreign even to Mandri.
“The thing that you need to know... The thing you need to understand is that humans weren’t made to do anything other than solve practical problems. 
Still sad. 
Don’t feel like fight for yourself, huh? Just giving up?
I am.

Take him to lizard pit.
Throws him in
Now that’s a problem. There’s no room in the Ayramun for people who can’t defend themselves.
Well that’s fine. I don’t want to be in the Ayramun.
More scared of you than you are of it.
Scream
Maybe not.
Chop?
Give him a sword.
Mandri is like fuck you.
Fuck you!
Shake
AH shit. Chopper- 
Chopper jumps in, chops up the lizard.
Opens up the lizard jaw off the wound.
Mandri screams.
Moto picks Mandri up.
“Here, chew on this.”
Ah shit. Tried to warn ya.

I don’t trust a man who hasn’t thought of killing himself. Shows he’s sane.



You gotta move fast - but do it slowly
What!?
Don’t let it sense your fear. They get riled up if they do.

“There men of opportunity. They won’t fight you if you don’t fight back.”

 unlike the highways which keep to the river banks or hop between oases, these roads cut through the vast expanses of the Sand, and that means exposure to the sun, the wind, and the heat - it is certain death if a pilgrim goes unprepared. The longer the road the deadlier it all is, though that’s only a rule of thumb because the worst Charnel Road, the Bazul Road, is one of the shortest. It sits just north of the Uncharted Portion and it runs up and over the crest of a low-lying range of hills. An eon of blasting sand had reduced those once proud mountains to a dump of gravel, and it does much the same to pilgrims who dare to make the scramble.
It only takes a full day to make the Bazul Road if you start at the nearest Hrkan outpost at Shahiz, but the Bazul road is a shadeless world of chalky gravel, white as bone, so the sunlight doesn’t disappear into the ground, it gets thrown right back up into the face. A pilgrim can’t even hide in her own shadow. She gets baked from below as much as from above.

            <Title>Old Salavan Convo</Title>
            <Text>“This here is what opened my eyes to Mid.”
“What does it say?”
“It says, ‘You must kill yourself.’”
“For a while I marked it as the ravings of one possessed, especially considering what came of that woman. But, in time, I saw some wisdom in it. Perhaps I’m putting the wisdom there, but it feel like I found it. Tell me, have you ever tried killing yourself? Figuratively speaking.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“Have you ever tried living for a while as if Mandrameen Andramawmun were dead.”
“Again, I don’t quite follow.”
“Come now, Mandri. Standing here before me, is not Mandrameen, but a fleshy vessel. Inside, there is whatever you want to put inside.”
“
“You’re not getting it.”
“No, I’m not. Should I just pretend I’m not me? I don’t think it works that way. I’ll know I’m me.”
 Sal leaned back and sighed. The freeweed seemed to be sapping his energy. “What’s your trauma, Mandri. I’ve got a working theory that every really good artist has some trauma.” 
“So what is it? A broken heart? Young man your age, in decent health, that’s usually it. The thing you’ve got to come to understand is that your broken heart is there because you put it there. Mandrameen put it there. If you kill Mandrameen, he can no longer stop you from throwing away his treasure. You’ll no longer be broken hearted.”
“I didn’t put it there.”
 “You must see that you did.”
“You want me to blame myself for what other people have done to me?”
 “You take no responsibility?”
 “I’d sooner blame you.”
 “Me?”

“You know, I’m impressed,” Salavan continued. “Perhaps now you realize the strength of your own Will. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it - the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing? And now here you are! Doing it! Well, you tried to. It’s the attempt I admire.” He took a step forward. “But here, let me show you how it’s done.”
 “Did you ever dream of committing murder?” Salavan asked. He put the knife up against Mandrameen’s throat. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this? It’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan peered into Mandrameen’s gasping mouth. “Yes, I can see it!” Salavan exclaimed with glee. “Hah! I can see it there inside of you now! The way everything is squirming in there.” He set the knife’s blunt edge against Mandrameen’s tongue and pressed down. “Yes! Gods, you really fucked this up Mandrameen. When you pass on into the Hell, that should be your final thought, that this is all your fault.” 

Salavan was a tall, large man. Easily twice Mandrameen’s size. too, and rich enough to be wrapped in a yellow silk robe replete with roses embroidered in pink. He standing on his stoop, out of the rain, and beckoned Mandrameen inside. 
“I was beginning to wonder if you were coming,” Salavan said. “The wife and girls are out, so it’s just us.”
“I hope Marta was able cook a little something before she left,” Mandrameen said as he stomped up the wide portico stairs to where Salavan was standing.
“Yes, yes, I told her you were on the way,” Salavan said with a chuckle. “She finished a few pot-stickers before she left, just for you.” 
“Your wife is divine.”
“Indeed she is. But where is Soreel?” 
Mandrameen paused to remove his sandals, then stuck his feet out into the rain to rid them of mud. 
“I don’t know. She said she’d meet me up here, but I haven’t seen her.”
 “She said that? Well that’s no matter. How are you? Haven’t seen you in years! You’re not drunk already?”
“A little, sure.” said Mandrameen.
Mandrameen’s eyes were red and witless, his nose was runny, and his mouth seemed as if it were stuck in a permanent sigh.
Salavan gave Mandrameen a practiced but insincere look of concern. Mandrameen was too weak to be of any real concern.
“You’re soaking and muddy,” Salavan said, “Let me get you washed up. A towel and some clothes.”
Mandrameen tried to brush him off. “No, no, that’s fine. I won’t be long.”
“Nonsense, I insist.” Salavan said.
“I won’t be long.”
“Mandrameen, I don’t care about you being dirty, I care about my floors being dirty.” He clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out with a lump of soap, a scrub, and a towel. 
Salavan made sure the boy gave Mandrameen’s arms and legs a good scrubbing, then made the boy fetch a tunic. Once Mandrameen was dried and changed, wearing the same dull garb that the boy was, he was ushered into the main hall.
As if an honored position on Meskalim’s Hill were not enough, Salavan’s home was the one of the largest around, certainly its opulence was second to none. It had cost Salavan three siver-strings of imported lumber just to burn enough lime to make enough plaster to coat the massive walls. The rare paints for the fresco that wrapped around the interior atrium took another fortune more - though it was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Sol at the very moment of his apotheosis - the sun-god was laid out across the eastern wall, wearing a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as he plunged it into his brother’s back.
“To business then!” Salavan exclaimed. He clapped Mandrameen on the shoulder and led him towards the staircase which climbed up to the second floor, where dinner awaited. 
“Mandrameen, you know I’ve been impressed with how you’ve handled things, considering the circumstances. Lesser men would be looking for someone to blame. Blame the Gods. You could have even blamed me.”
“Blamed you?”
“You know, small men, they delight in nuturing resentment against the man who buys them. That’s all they have, really.”
“Oh. That doesn’t sound like me.”
“Quite right. That’s what I’m saying. You’re a good man, and a good man never dwells on failure. It’s on to the next opportunity.”
 “No, no, no,” Pyelte said. “That’s not why it doesn’t matter.”
 “Oh?”
“It’s the wife.”
“Ah, I see. Business can wait, I suppose.”
“I really thought she would... I mean… I took her to the Fordwell, and really, it was so beautiful. Sol could have descended in a cloud right then and there to give us a blessing. I mean it was a beautiful day.”
“So is today - in it’s own way.” 
The second floor of Salavan’s house had a high ceiling and high windows that offered a stunning view of the storm outside. By now, the rains had started to move on, and they made room for Sol’s golden light to shift into pink and purple pastels as it played on the city and the clouds all around. 
Common to the fashion of the Solean elite, the furnishings of Salavan’s second story were muted and tasteful so as to pick up Sol’s light. Here the floor was covered in massive rugs that were subtly patterned with white lilies and were trimmed with glittering gold ropes. They served as giant picture frames for the colors that Sol cast upon them. On top were pillows upon pillows for comfort, all white with gold tassels and ivory lace threading them together. In one corner, the floor had been hollowed out to accommodate a hefty hotstone. It was heated by the kitchen below and a burning brazier above. It was already portioned with meats. At the sides of the stone were reclining chairs made of rope strung into angled ebony frames. Mandrameen sighed as he reclined into his, then munched on a potsticker that he had pulled from the hotstone. 
Half an hour ago, the rain was cold and overwhelming. Now, it was a cozy and soothing murmur set against the warm light of the brazier.
“Claire has been the hardest bit for me,” Mandrameen said in between bites. “The drought, the fields, this cursed storm that’s going to ruin the land… I can handle those. But her… Twenty-two years… Its the kind of thing when you lose, its gone forever.”
“You two aren’t separating, are you?”
“She was cheating on me, Salavan.”
“Oh?”
Mandrameen pauses as the emotion wells up.
“Mandrameen, you’re in a tragic spot and I’m sorry for that,” Sal said as he lit up a wrap of freeweed. His great bulk was still settling into his chair. “But, I’ve got to be honest - I can’t relate to what you are going through. I’ve heard stories of loves-lost and loves-lorn and I’ve tasted it a little, but, well you know that Marta and I were kids when we were married.”
“I know.”
“So,” Sal said before taking a long drag from his wrap, “I can give you financial and business advice, but what you need right now, I can’t give it to you.”
Mandrameen bit into another potsticker. He savored the sweet peach sauce in which the shredded chicken had been baked.
“This is so good,” he said. “If only I could steal Marta from you.”
“You are certainly welcome to try,” Sal said, smiling.
“I suppose I would fail.” Mandrameen moaned. “At this point, I would have to pay for it if I wanted intimacy.” 
“Mandrameen...”
“It’s this face. This damned body. Like my father’s - I don’t understand how he ever got a woman to stick with him.”
“Claire’s not that shallow. Besides, your father was richer than I am.”
“It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter,“ Mandrameen asserted, eager not to be distracted from his pity. 
Sal took another drag from his wrap before continuing on to his point. “Just settle for a woman that will have you for your money. You’ve not got much of it left, but any little bit of money out here can go a good ways. Money has a way of motivating a person to look deeper into a Being. First she’ll have you for your money, and I trust, in time, she’ll have you for you.” 
“I’ve been married to Claire for thirteen years, Sal. If that wasn’t long enough to… wait, are you saying I should move on already?”
Sal leaned back in his ornamented chair and folded his hands across his stomach. “You’ve spent your whole life getting what you want in the way that you want it, Mandrameen, except this one thing. You’re spoiled - no, that’s not fair - You’re stubborn. Women of consequence, women like Claire, they pick up on that as soon as you open your mouth. No one wants to be stuck with a stubborn ass for a lifetime.”
“I guess so.”
Mandrameen’s flippancy was disturbing. Sal looked down his nose at the broken man, and in the flickering firelight he caught the glimmer of tears streaking down Mandrameen’s face. Sal looked away in disgust, and caught sight of the horizon. There, Sol’s light was dimming, the rain was letting up, and through it he could make out the evening song of Swassel birds drifting in on a cool breeze. The mood would have been delightful if it weren’t for Mandrameen’s sorrow clouding the room.
“Have some freeweed,” Sal demanded.
“No.”
“Mandrameen, I may not know the depths of your sadness -” Salavan said with a sarcastic bite, “but I’ve had my share of sadness in general, and a wrap of freeweed blunts its edge. It’s the only thing I can offer you. Take it.”
Mandrameen wiped his eyes with the palm of his hand and tried to compose himself before taking a wrap from the tray near him. He then stood up to light it in the fire that burned above the hotstone.
 “I think this is it for me,” Mandrameen said as he rolled the tip of the wrap in the flame. “I’m done. I’m finally done with it all. I’m going to do it.”
“What do you mean?” Sal asked.
“You’re going to make me say it?”
“Say what?”
Mandrameen simply smiled, turned his chair to face Salavan, and sat back down to nurse his freeweed and glare at Salavan.
“Well, I’m sure you’ve considered all alternatives. I don’t need to remind you that in the eyes of the Gods killing yourself is the same as killing any other.”
“Alternatives...”
“Did you ever get to hear old Pella Germin preach?”
“I don’t go in for that.”
“I heard her preach once. She said that we are expected to kill ourselves.”
“Did she?”
“She said something like, ‘Corruption is a stain that does not wash off. To be free of it, to achieve peace, you must first kill yourself.’”
“You were there when she preached this?”
“I was. For a while I marked it as the ravings of a Dreamer, especially considering what came of her. But, in time, I saw some wisdom in it. Perhaps I put the wisdom there, but it felt like I found it. So tell me, have you tried killing yourself? Figuratively, I mean.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“It means, try living for a little bit as if Mandrameen Andramawmun were dead.”
“That’s a bit heretical, isn’t it?”
“No, no, no. Follow me here. From this moment on, Mandrameen is dead, and residing inside this fleshy vessel is whoever you want to put in there.”
“If it were possible... Well, what? I should just pretend I’m not me? I don’t think it works that way.”
 Sal leaned forward. The freeweed was working its energy into him. “Your broken heart is there because you put it there. Mandrameen put it there. If you kill Mandrameen, he can no longer stop you from throwing away his treasure.”
“I put it there?”
 “Yes! You must see that.”
“I should blame myself for what other people have done to me?”
 “You take no responsibility?”
 “I’d sooner blame you, Sal.”
 “Me?”
“What? You didn’t think I’d find out?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Salavan, I saw you two fucking.”
The accusation fell like a hammer blow, it flattened out the mood and stunned Salavan into silence. He narrowed his eyes, sat back in his chair, and glared at Mandrameen while the moment passed between them. Only when it was good and gone did he grunt and snarl and huff and say , “I see.”
 Mandrameen leapt up out of his chair, his face flushed and his limbs tight with purpose. He reached into his tunic for his knife.
It wasn’t there.
He had left it with his wet clothes downstairs. 
“You’re so god-damned stupid,” Salavan said, “You’re looking for this?” 
He took Mandrameen’s knife out of his own pocket.
“You know I was wondering about this - I know you’re one of those loony Dreamer types who never travel armed, and so I wondered… but I thought you were just going to kill yourself. But my! How could I forget - you’re an ambitious man!”
He stood up. The great bulk of him dwarfed Mandrameen. 
Mandrameen’s knees almost buckled. 
“You know, I’m impressed,” Salavan continued. “Perhaps now you realize the strength of your own Will. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it - the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing? And now here you are! Doing it! Well, you tried to. It’s the attempt I admire.” He took a step forward. “But here, let me show you how it’s done.” 
Mandrameen turned to run, but Salavan kicked out at his feet. It was enough to knock a drunken Mandrameen to the carpet. 
Salavan pounced.
 “Hold still, Mandrameen! Hold still!”
“Stop! Help!”
Salavan used his great strength to wrestle Mandrameen’s flailing limbs into submission, and used his weight to squeeze the air from Mandrameen’s lungs. He delighted in the pitiful sound that Mandrameen made as he wheezed. 
 “Did you ever dream of committing murder?” Salavan asked. He put the knife up against Mandrameen’s throat. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this? It’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan peered into Mandrameen’s gasping mouth. “Yes, I can see it!” Salavan exclaimed with glee. “Hah! I can see it there inside of you now! The way everything is squirming in there.” He set the knife’s blunt edge against Mandrameen’s tongue and pressed down. “Yes! Gods, you really fucked this up Mandrameen. When you pass on into the Hell, that should be your final thought, that this is all your fault.”
Tears streamed down Mandrameen’s face and his lungs burned in agony. Salavan paused his ramblings to delight in the picture. 
“There’s no greater feeling,” he muttered.
As Mandrameen’s vision started to blur, he thought he could see something at the window - a shadow of a figure. It pulled itself up and into the room. It was shrouded and skinny and tall, absolutely massive, nearly the height of the ceiling. 
Mandrameen thought that Death incarnate had come. His time was at an end.
Salavan screamed.
“EAAAUUUGHHH!” 
The knife fell from Mandrameen’s mouth and Salavan tumbled off him to the floor.
Mandrameen coughed and spat and wriggled up against the wall. When his vision cleared he saw that Salavan’s arm was struck with an arrow. At the window was a man, a giant man, taller than even Salavan by at least a foot. At his side was a massive bow. He knocked another arrow.
“Thief! Brigand!” Salavan yelled, clutching at his pierced arm. He scrambled to his feet and ran towards the stairs, but he stopped when he saw that it was blocked by another hooded figure. 
“Hill!?” 
A short, squat man all wrapped in black ascended the stairs. He held a scimitar in his hand, and pointed it towards Salavan’s fat belly. 
“Hill, what are you doing here?” Salavan asked.
“You know why. No games,” Hill said. His speech was thick with a southern Jandreen lilt.
“Take what you will and be gone!” Salavan shouted, but Hill ignored him. Instead, he pointed with his sword to the giant at the window.
“Do you know who is he?” 
Salavan twisted round. He had never seen a man as broad or as tall, but he had heard stories. This could only be the famous Giant of the Junei. “You’re Ayram.”
“Yes, he is Ayram.” Hill walked round to where Ayram stood. He gave quick glance to Mandrameen, who sat frozen on a heap of pillows. “Ayram is boss, and you make me look bad.” Hill poked Salavan in the stomach with his sword and then cut the knot which held Salavan’s robe together. It fell apart to reveal a large, hairy belly.
“What are you talking about? 
“Ayram trust me, I trust you, you betray me, it look like I betray Ayram.”
“Betray you?”
“No games.”
“Dammit Hill! At least tell me what you think I did.” He turned to plead with Ayram. “Ayram, Ayram whatever this cretin told you about me -”
Hill lashed out with his sword-arm and cut Salavan’s belly. It wasn’t deep, but the speed and shock of it put Salavan off balance.
“You little demon!” he roared. 
Hill just tut-tutted and shook his head.
“You no talk to Ayram,” he said. “You deal with me. You broke my trust.”
“Whatever you think it is that I did - I didn’t.”
“Fine. We play game.” Hill lashed out again and cut an X into Salavan’s belly.
“STOP! Hill! Just tell me what the Hell is going on!”
“You give me bad information. I give it to Ayram. My friends die. You deny this?”
“What? You think I set you up?”
“You didn’t?”
Salavan shook his head. “Hill, you fucking idiot. Why the Hell would I do that?”
“That is why we be here. To find out.”
“Hill… Ayram... You people are more valuable to me than anything. I would never betray you or whatever it is you think. Go ahead! Take whatever you want. There’s no need for this.”
Hill took a step towards Ayram. His face passed into deadly seriousness.
“The call on that caravan - where you get it?”
“I’m the exchequer for the mining guild. I have access to all of the -”
“That wasn’t a mining column.”
“Yes it was.”
“That was Imperial cavalry.”
“Imperial cavalry? I pointed you towards a Sheldri company caravan. Seventy-two hands. Five wagons. ”
“Seventy two, yes. Five, yes. But one Seilsi. You left that out.”
“What?”
“There was a Seilsi.”
Salavan stumbled over his next words. “A - a Seilsi? What would a Seilsi be doing with -”
“Stop.”
“I have no -”
“I say stop.”
“But I have no -”
Hill plunged his sword into Salavan’s thigh. Salavan doubled over then crumpled down to the ground. His blood dripped on to the carpet, and it spread out over the intricate gold patten and soaked deep into the white fibers. 
“Please! Please!”
Hill pulled out his sword and slapped Salavan’s side with it.
“You a big man, Sal.” Hill said. “Ayram, how many he can take?”
Ayram stood still, towering over the scene, stroking his beard with his fingers. He did not respond.
Hill tilted his head from side to side as he appraised Salavan’s great bulk, then he poked it with his finger to test its firmness.
“Very fat. I can cut it all off if you like?”
“Hill…”
“Yes?”
“Let me do some asking. If what you say is true -”
“You doubt the Truth?”
“No! No. Just let me do some asking. I was set up, same as you.”
“You really not know?”
“I didn’t! I swear to the Gods I didn’t!”
Hill looked at Ayram. He nodded.
Hill lifted his sword above Salavan’s head.
“Wait,” Ayram said. “Let the little man do it.”
All three of them looked at Mandrameen. 
“Mandrameen, right?” 
Mandrameen nodded.
Ayram walked over and picked up Mandrameen’s knife. He stood close enough that Mandrameen, looking up, could see his face. The brazier’s fire lit it up from underneath so that his sunken cheeks cast shadows over his eyes. Mandrameen could feel his glare digging into him, digging right through his own eyes and into his mind, into his soul, even. 
“Do what you came here to do,” Ayram said. He held out Mandrameen’s knife. It seemed like a toothpick in his massive, calloused palm.
“I’m… I’m not…”
Ayram smiled. “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I heard the whole thing. You’re a man after my own heart, Mandrameen. He deserves it. Let me help you.”
He reached down and grabbed Mandrameen’s upper-arm then lifted him up like a child and set him onto his feet. His tight grip seemed so rigged with strength and vigor that Mandrameen thought he might snap the bone with an easy squeeze - but Ayram wasn’t rough. With a paternal touch he guided Mandrameen along to where Salavan knelt, and then placed the knife in Mandrameen’s hand. 
“Go on.” 
Salavan cowered in the flickering firelight, bleeding all over, eyes stuck wide with fear. His heavy breathing was the loudest thing in the room. Mandrameen no longer saw him as a man, as an enemy, but an animal - just meat and bone and terror. He expected Salavan to plead for mercy. He even hesitated to wait for it. When it didn’t come he almost asked Salavan if he wanted it, and in his excited mood he might have given it, but his lips quivered and sank and he put the knife up to Salavan’s throat. 
“A last thought, Salavan?”
Sweat beaded down the sides of Salavan’s face. He glanced round the room - over to Hill, up to Ayram, and when his eyes settled at last on Mandrameen he furrowed his brow and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could get out a word Mandrameen split his throat.
Salavan fell forward, face down into the carpet. He gargled and gasped, one arm clutching his throat, one pulling on Mandrameen’s tunic. Mandrameen tried to swipe it away, but Salavan’s grip was still strong. As Mandrameen staggered back he dragged Salavan along so that his body painted a bloody swath across the rug. Finally, Mandrameen slashed at Salavan’s arm with his knife and that was enough to get rid of it.
In a few moments, after a few spasms, Salavan was dead. His sprawling corpse and in his pooling blood was neatly framed by the rectangle of the rug’s golden trim. His head was even placed on a perfect third, drawing the eye. It was as if Sol had composed the canvas himself so that His twilight could play over the gruesome scene with the firelight, affirming to all who were present His majesty, His Will, .
Salavan, at least, had come to a poetic end.

“Somebody’s coming.”
Ayram bounded over to the window and drew his bow.
“The wife.”
“Hold it!” Mandrameen yelled. “Hold it!”
Both Hill and Ayram looked back at Mandrameen for an explanation.
“She’s done nothing wrong!”
“Nothing you know,” said Hill.
“She doesn’t deserve to die,” Mandrameen pleaded.
“Deserved to be made a widow, though?” Ayram asked.
Mandrameen looked down at his feet. Ayram laughed and loosened his draw. “No worries, my little drunk man. No worries. Come, let us depart.” 
Hill jumped out of the window and into evening sky. Ayram tossed Mandrameen down after him, then leapt along beside. The each scurried into the shadow of the wall. Hill moved like mouse, and Ayram seemed to be shadow himself. Mandrameen stumbled along and nearly gave them away as Salavan’s wife, Marta, and her two girls made their way up the stoop.
The two brigands circled around behind and out the gate, and Mandrameen followed along as best he could. Twice, out in the street, he lost track of them. Drunk as he was it wasn’t hard, but even sober it would have been difficult; Hill and Ayram were nearly as one with shadow and the shadows grew long as the sun had begun to set. When Ayram doubled back the second time he took a hold of Mandrameen’s wrist and did not let go again for the rest of the journey through Jeket’s streets and alleys. 
Mandrameen was content to be led. He only needed to keep his feet moving. He didn’t want to work. He didn’t want to think. He wanted only to cry and to be done with it. When at last they came to a stop inside of a secluded shrine to the Dreamer, he collapsed to his knees and begged to left alone. When Hill opened the door to a little crypt behind the Dreamer’s eye, Ayram picked Mandrameen up and carried him under his arm. 
Hill lit a torch. Inside the shrine there were three plain stone sarcophagi. Hill kicked the lid of the center one open. Mandrameen peered into and was surprised to see that there wasn’t a mummified corpse, there was a hole. 
“What is that?” he asked.
“The way out.” Hill said.
“Where does it lead?” 
“It be the Underworld?”
“The Underworld?” Mandrameen asked in a frightened whisper. “Here? A passage down is here?”
“They’re everywhere,” Ayram said. “You just have to know where to look.”
At that he tossed Mandrameen down into the hole, then dived in after him.


 Ayram interrogating Salaman,
&quot;I’m trying to figure out why you told me it was gold out there. You know what I’m trying to do out here. You know I’d jump at the chance to take out a Mazydei. So when I was knocked out by his blast of power, you know what I was dreaming about for two days? Why would Salavan lie to me about it? Why tip me off to a shipment of gold that isn’t there, and instead lead me into the lion’s den?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Salavan said, fawning. “You’re here, you killed him! It’s all good! Good!”
“I can only think of two reasons why you’d set me up.”
“Set you up? No! No. Set up the Imperial scum, sure. Not you.”
“But you could have told me. I might not have lost thirty Ayramun that way.”
“Thirty Ayramun? Forgive me, Ayram. Forgive for saying, with all due respect, that thirty Ayramun is a small price to pay for killing one of the nine, no?”
Ayram gets real close, as if to show by his sheer size that he wasn’t afraid of anything. The mere suggestion that Salavan was up to things Ayram wasn’t was an inslut.
“They were Ayramun, Salavan. They were me. You’ve a blood debt to pay.”
Ayram motions to Hill, who gave shrill whistle. Then Salavan’s family came marching up the stairs.
Horror in their faces.
“Tell me why you set me up. You figured the Mazydei would kill me?”
“Kill you? Nonsense. Impossible.”
“What was it then? Why not just tell me I was up against a Mazydei. You wanted to make sure I killed the beast instead of taking him captive? I think you know they’re worth more to me alive than dead. That’s the only other thing that makes sense here - that he knew something about something and you didn’t want to risk it getting to me.”
“Take a Mazydei captive? Nonsense. They’re too powerful to be -“
Salavan’s words were cut short by a knife to the neck.
“I’m only going to ask you this once: What’s going on that you don’t want me to know about?”
Salavan glances down at the blade.
“Oh, this knife here, not going kill you with it. See there’s a knife just like it up against your wife’s neck. Just want you to feel the edge like she’s feeling it. Same shock of fear. Maybe it will sober you up and come clean.”
“You’re… You’re going to kill her anyways.”
“Yes, but Salavan… because of your lifestyle,” and he stressed the word ‘lifestyle’ as his eyes cast about the room with a disapproving glare, “I don’t expect you to really feel the weight of what I’m about to say, but not all deaths are the same.” 
Ayram could read the confusion writtin on Salavan face, his gibbering lips.
“I’ve seen people die in seconds. I’ve seen people suffer years of torment. And it’s not just a matter of time. I’ve seen people suffer years in seconds.”



Salavan is like, Mandrameen! Didn’t expect to see you! Where’s soreel? Whats the secret to your beer. I hear its date syrup, but every time I put it in, its got this sweet, cloying taste that coats the tongue and its terrible.


A high, stuccoed wall shielded Salavan’s courtyard from the world, and two guards were standing at the gate. Mandrameen walked up them, told them who he was, and they let him in. By now his sparkling vision was beginning to fade.

He knew he wanted to kill Salavan. After that, he had only to decide how he wanted to die. The most poetic end would be to wander down one of the thief infested alleys near the Heberdee Gate - one final stab in the back would be fitting.

Mr pangloss given a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to his mother’s chambermaid.
One day Cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called a park, saw between the bushes, Dr. Pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to her mother's chamber-maid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very docile. As Miss Cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly observed the repeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly perceived [Pg 4]the force of the Doctor's reasons, the effects, and the causes; she turned back greatly flurried, quite pensive, and filled with the desire to be learned; dreaming that she might well be a sufficient reason for young Candide, and he for her. 

There he was made to wheel about to the right, and to the left, to draw his rammer, to return his rammer, to present, to fire, to march, and they gave him thirty blows with a cudgel. The next day he did his exercise a little less badly, and he received but twenty blows. The day following they gave him only ten, and he was regarded by his comrades as a prodigy. 

An able surgeon cured Candide in three weeks by means of emollients taught by Dioscorides. He had already a little skin, and was able to march when the King of the Bulgarians gave battle to the King of the Abares

            <Title>Cromwell</Title>
            <Text>I owe it to my sons to make a better life for them. England is no longer a country for a young man.
I recall you once spoke out in parliament for the rights and priveleges of the common people.
Ah. That was a long time ago. I had a vision then. A great nation. Prosperous. God-fearing. Good laws. Strong. Respected throught the world. That was the England I dreamed of.
Well sir. You are a squire now. A man of property. Perhaps you no longer care for the common people. Perhaps I’ve been misinformed sir. I thought as a puritan you’d see it as your god-given duty to do the lords work in this land, regardless of sacrifice.
Mr. Ireton, I was fighting for the liberty of the common people when you were in knee britches.
Then why are you leaving?
I am leaving because this country crawls with greed and corruption. It is governed by profiteers who think more of their profits than their principles. I am leaving because we have a king who taxes the rich beyond its means and steals the land from the poor to maintain its lavish court and his catholic wife. And when parliament objects against these injustices, he closed his parliament down, and our man dare not speak his mind for fear of imprisonment. Yes, all my life I felt it was gods work to fight such tyranny. But god has turned his back upon this nation, and we are leaving it.
And what if parliament should be recalled.
And why should he do that? To build another palace?
No. To fight a war.
A war, john? A war against whom?
The scots have assembled an army on our border they may invade us at any moment.  The king needs money to raise an army.
How many times did we sit and parliament and how many times did he overrule us? Oh the king can have his war with scotland and we will be in america. 
There will be a war, mr cromwell, it will not be with scotland.
With whom?
Against the king.
The king? You mean a civil war? In england? You know not the ways of this nation. Such things do not happen here.
In my opinion it is long overdue.
God is behind our swords.
Every man who wages war believes god is on his side. God should begin to wonder who is on his. Good evening sir.

People breaking down fences. Land is being stolen from them. 

The rights to pasture belong to the common people. By what authority do you take that away.
By authority of his majesty’s commisioners, granting me and my friends full rights to this land for the purposes of improvement.
Such a contract cannot be legal. It is in violoation of the law of this land.
The king is the law of this land.
On the contrary, it is the kings duty to maintain the law. This is common land, it belongs to the people.
This is my land and you are trespassing. Out of respect for you rank I wont have you arrested for obstructing the law.

To put an effective army in the field the crown must have a million pounds. The crown does not have a million pounds. We must instate congress to provide money. 
Congress!? The king of england to go cap in hand with the common people like a - beggar! Aye! A beggar!
I have no choice.
I say take the money. You my lord are absolved before god and before man on any subjection. For in extreme necessity, can do all that power permits.
Do you mean I should declare war on my own people. 
Aye! Before they declare war on you.


Earl of stratford whispers in the er of the king.
Turns it around on the earl, calls for his impeachment.

You are impertinent
Such issues are byond good manners.

Put your faith in god,
And put your sword in their belly! - my twist

Hope these gallant generals of hol and manchester had taken up with the enemy, for then we’d have a surer chance at victory. For by their reluctance to pursue this war with the intesity that it demands, that have proved themselves treachorous to our cause and to this nation.

Why in the bowels of Sol did we do this!

I have neither eyes to speak, nor ears to ear, save that which the parliament grants me.

Map with pieces of wood symbolizing troops.
King is strategizing.
Marquez’s forces surrendered to cromwell yesterday.
Cromwell. I hear nothing but cromwell. Cromwell. 
My lord this is nothing but a game we play here. A game with wooden armies and paper flags. Tis but a block of wood you hold in your hand.
— reminding commanding heights is different than the pof on the ground.

I will not countenance defeat.

Bribed
“How little you know me, that you think you can buy my principles. How you insult me with such a cheap bribe.”
Is that was England is worth to you? 40,000 pounds?

            <Title>Old bargain</Title>
            <Text>A wry smile spread thinly scribe, and the man cast a suggestive glance at the army behind him. He leaned forward in his saddle, made a joke of assessing Ayram’s motley crew, and then he said to Ayram, in apparent disbelief, “You have complaints my terms?”
“I do,” said Ayram.
The scribe chuckled.
“Whatever complaints you may have can be assuaged. We come only for the lord Mazyd, and we will give you a fair offer. Now, you and your outland clan have broken the law, and so Nature dictates that you should be tromped under by a Hrkan boot, but Prudence dictates that this matter should be resolved cleanly, quickly, and peaceably. Now, here is what is going to happen if you ”

Ayram nodded, as if . He looked up at the sky as if he were contemplating. “One thing my father taught me, is that it is not possible to resolve a conflict peaceably if both sides do not truly understand eachother.”
“This is not the time for your haggling arts. Speak what you want plainly and if it is reasonable it is yours. The sparing of your lives is already a monumental gift.”
“I think it is important that you understand the nature of my complaint with your terms. It’s not a simple as you have something that I want.”
Ayram marches up. Smacks the guys horse in the head and it crumples to the ground. Guy scambles to get away pitifully, but Ayram leapt upon him as fast.

“Tell me, what seems my complaint to you?”
“Beast!”
“Beast, am I? For killing your horse? I’ve seen you break the legs of a thousand of my horses just to rid a road of their encumbrance. And the death of this single horse offends you?”
Ayram turned to his band of outland clay. “It seems I have not made my complaint clear enough to this man! It’s time you understand how it feels to be outland clay.”
Forthwith he brought the point of his spud bar down with the speed of a blur and plunged it into the back of the scribe’s hand, pinning it to the ground. The bar was so thick and so little of the , that in the schock of the moment, he , and ripped the wide open.
He let loose a A blood curdling scream.
“Yes!” Ayram yelled, his voice boomed through the tunnel. “Couldn’t have put it better myself.”
The scribe screamed, into garbled words. “Harber of the Shon, I curse you!”
“Yes! We’ve come to an understanding!”
Clutching his arm. Through the pain, Mandri saw in those ex, a realization dawn that he might be about to die. Confronted with the prospect of his own death sharpens him. Eyes once bright and, now red and annoyed, and already his skin looked sallow. His breath, out of control, channeled into a simmering anger.

            <Text>There’s nothing complicated about terror—or any emotion for that matter. Love, hate, terror, whatever, Mandri was old enough to see through their tired routine: first they startled him into stupidity, and then they spurred him into action, or reigned him in, according to the flavor of the moment. There was no fighting it.
A roaring beam of Mazydfire lit up the night, and next thing Mandri knew, he was running through Shulgi’s bowels, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because that there wasn’t any time to light one up, even though it only took five god-damned seconds. As it goes with terror, love, hate, and whatever; reason is not allowed to have a say.
Mandri hated it. Hating hate might seem paradoxical, but that’s just a trick of language. This was a reasonable hate. It starts with distrust. He distrusted terror and hate and all of those other emotions for the simple reason that it’s possible to feel two of them at once. If you can both love and hate a person, then that proves that there is a truer, deeper, reality of which love and hate are only crude approximations—in Mandri’s terms, there’s a color portrait to be painted here, but all we have are pigments black and white.
And to be clear, this wasn’t a trick of language. It’s not the case that the condition of ‘loving-and-hating’ is, in itself, a unique emotional state for which some genius has yet to come along and invent the right word to label it. What is really happening is that one moment there is a caring love, and in the next there is a spiteful hate, and the mind vacillates between the two, and seeing them pass by in quick succession blurs them together, but if Mandri stopped and noticed he could distinguish them, and as soon as he did that, the insufficiency of it all became readily apparent.
So it is with love and hate, and so it is with comfort and terror. If Solraheen is both comforting and terrifying, well, the fault is not with Him. He could, however, be blamed in a roundabout way. He could have chosen to give Mandri’s Spark a more complete palette with which to paint an inner world. Instead, Mandri ran confused right through those moments where love and hatred bled together, and he despised having to grapple with the fear of a loving Divine. The end result was always the same: he’d get fed up with all the dissonance and decide to surrender himself to the calm, cool waters of not giving a damn, though that wasn’t really possible either, not completely, and not for long. Not long, at least, whenever he was lost inside a temple mountain, fleeing from the threat of a vengeful Mazyd who no doubt relished the chance to put a beam fire through his skull.
And then there was whatever witchy mumblings Elrahet was whispering as she scampered along in the dark.
“This isn’t right. This isn’t right. This isn’t right. That bitch!”
Purl yanked Mandri’s arm and told him to put his sword away. He didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab someone,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“Then who are you going stab? The Mazyd?”
“No,” said Mandri. “I just feel safer with it out.”
“I’d feel safer with it sheathed, so sheathe it.”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade. Good thing he did, because a moment later, Moto took a sharp turn into a dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“Where are we?” Moteah asked with venom. Moto, the prime object of her ire, turned from the  and said, “I think we should wait here for Ayram.”
“Don’t act like you meant to run in here.”
Seb, who was bringing up the rear, said, “There’s no point in waitin’ up for Ayram. He’s dead.”
Moto dismissed Seb’s dour pronouncement with a sneer, and then he added, for everyone else’s benefit, “Ayram’s not dead.”
“Is too,” said Seb. “Consumed by Mazydfire.”
“He fell down a canyon before the flame even touched him.”
“That’s not what I saw,” said Seb.
“You didn’t see shit.”
Moteah asked Moto, “Ayram fell down a canyon?”
Moto said, “He jumped into it. To escape.”
As they argued back Mandri would have preferred the terrified running if it hadn’t been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. No temple he’d ever been in was so black—and it wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps, because there weren’t any fittings bolted to the walls, and the chiseled ceiling was free from the soot of ages, and unlike Minting Rock, there weren’t any holes to let in natural light—Shulgi was much too thick for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help you lose yourself, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
There was art all along the walls that Mandri was just now noticing. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around this apparent dead end, and they were stacked upon the each other from floor to the ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved and , and painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with rows and rows of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, garden scenes where Old Jandri lord strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of martyrs screaming Solraheen’s name as tongues of flame licked their ribs.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of tomb art. Some rich prick decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when the tomb’s door is sealed, no one is allowed to look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste.
It was never creative. They always asked for the same stories to be painted on their walls. Tell the story of the world, in whatever flavor one agrees with, usually starting with Solraheen’s , and then , graven into the inner side of the tomb door is a panel displaying the deceased’s contributions. A dull tradition.
But, ah, wait.
Traditions are cultural memories, borne in the distant past. Maybe that tradition started here at Shulgi, and that long before it was ever the sanctuary of the Greskalun, Shulgi was a tomb.
It was an interesting idea, but not all the pieces fit. To start, Mandri wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn’t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?
Mandri looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight, a light which blinked every time Moto by frantic arms and hands trying to express an argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene. It was the moment of Solraheen’s apotheosis, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face emerging from a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark that dug deep into rock all the way. Each claw was as wide as two fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in argument to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice.
“Hey!”
They all stopped bickering and eyed Mandri with a annoyance.
“Look at this,” he said, and he pointed up at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. 
Seb stepped over, studied the defacement, and shrugged. “It’s just some scratches,” he said.
Elrahet waddled over and held her torch high. She stood on her tiptoes to get here eye close to the claw mark. Mandri thought he saw her sniff.
When she balanced back on her heels her face gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said.
“What does that mean?” said Purl.
Elrahet grunted. “It means we need to leave.” 
Then the old witch twirled, black robes fluttering, and trotted off into the darkness, expecting everyone else to follow. 
Moto pushed past Mandri to confront Elrahet. “What about Ayram?”, he asked.
Elrahet shrugged him off and said, “Ayram can handle himself.”
“But you don’t even know where you’re going!”
“We make for the Backgate.”
To hear Moto say, “But you said you don’t remember—”
Moto’s protestation was cut short when Elrahet stopped in her tracks and he bumped into her.
“It doesn’t matter!” Elrahet declared, and she whacked her conclusion into Moto’s leg with her staff. “The faster we are out of here, the better, and that won’t happen if we’re standing still!”
Their journey through the dark began anew with Elrahet leading the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the smudges in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because she had a vague memory that the Backgate was, in her words, “down around there somewhere down there.”
They ventured so far down into the mountain that it seemed to Mandri this temple was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens, and there should be an ascension to the roof where he could await the coming dawn. But they went down, and the further down they went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling bowed up into a black void. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in on them. And after the ceiling, the walls disappeared, as they were now so far apart that the torchlight couldn’t reach them. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was ‘inside’.  The Ayramun were a splotch of light in a sea of darkness. If not for the hard stone under his feet and the faux-brick pattern on it, he would have supposed that they had wandered straight into the depths of Shis.
“I remember now,” said Elrahet.
She practically sprinted past two enormous coiled columns. These columns were easily four times the size of those in Shulgi’s entrance hall, and they straddled a long tongue of obsidian-studded floor which marked a processional way. The Ayramun hurried past these columns, and ahead was another pair, then another, and another, when finally, they came upon an incredible sandstone throne set atop a plinth of granite. Its seat was smooth and featureless, as if carved by a river, and its back was a petrified spire of flame licked into a curl by an unseen of wind.
 Elrahet stopped before it, took a moment catch her breath, then said, “There’s a hall behind.”
She scuttled around the throne, and the Ayramun followed. There behind the throne was, by Shulgi’s reckoning, a normal arched doorway cut out of the stne. They all filtered through, and they hadn’t gotten ten steps into this narrower hall, when Elrahet stopped again. 
Something on the ground had caught her attention.
She set her torch low to the floor.
There, splattered across a  was an unmistakable splatter of blood.
Out of the dark echoed a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed it was the voice of the mountain itself. 
“What do you make of it, witch?”
The voice rattled Mandri’s bones. Again he was wracked with a paralyzing terror.
An unaccounted-for voice weighs heavy on the scale of terror, heavier still if it comes echoing out a dark abyss, heavier still if it wheezes and warbles as if issuing forth from the throats of a hundred death-marked souls. 
Moto sent his torch spinning in this voice’s direction. The torch clattered along the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop before a fold of skin.
In its upshot light was a beast of for which terror was pure emotion. It was so large, fat, and bloated, that it seemed entirely composed of bleeding pustules and skin. Mandri knew there there must be a mouth in there somewhere, for its rasping voice echoed out again. 
“Let them shee my full gloooory.”
Two enormous braziers erupted in flame to reveal that there was not one creature with them in the hall, but three. Sitting in between them was a creature so monstrous that unmistakably human, a bag of human beef, bloated beyond belief, and sticking out of the top, like a cork, was the upper torso of a skinny, bearded man shawled in a tattered green robe. On his head was a crown. Demon roaches the size of dogs. Instead of legs there pitch black human arms, a human face, eternally upwards, silently gulping air like a fish out of water.
Mandri turned to run, but crouching on the wall behind, were four more of those demon beetles. 
Mandri found his sight drawn toward that demon king.
Moto said what he was thinking.
“What in shis are these?”
Elrahet, who , answered through “Hag beetles. Careful of them. They’ve spines in their shells, and their shells are hard as rock.”
A rumbling laugh boomed out from the amalgamete’s stomach. “Keep your names to yourshelf, whitch.”
Elrahet stepped forth, “Most putrid king,” she said, “none of us are worthy of a names, and yet a name, the bright lord gives.”
The creature smiled. His teeth were black and his spit was tar. The beetle-demons around him clicked and clacked, vibrating with their masters mood.
“A name?” the creature mused. “A NAME!? Hhhhaaaaaahhhhh!” The laugh sent a shudder through its whole bloated body. “Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I and mine are more than a name can hold. Look at me!”
Spread his arms out to show.
“You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.” She threw in to the prouncement of his name.
The creature, Greskal, laughed again, burping and as it did.
“Ugh-urp-ahuhhheheh… Greskal!?… Hah!”
Greskal leaned his great bulk forwards. Somewhere under his bulging girth were legs, but it was doubtful he could do much more than lean.
“I am no longer Greskal. I have become—I am becoming itself—I am the Amalgamete!”

“Do you think me ugly?” he said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have split and ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from rubber, and in the dim light it seemed that the lump of flesh in his grip was wriggling like a squealing piglet. He let this piglet slip, and his flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This flesh is the world,” said Greskal as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you see? This is the stuff of the world into which a spark thrown. The whiter the light of the spark, the more this filth gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would supplicate yourselves before me as your god.”
Elrahet looked down her nose at Greskal and said, “Your son had a stronger stomach than you. Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered through Greskal’s body. He pointed to Elrahet and shouted, “Silence that ensnaring womb!”
A black spear was launched at Elrahet. Moto’s sword lashed out with blinding speed and sent the spear bouncing harmlessly aside. 
Greskal grunted his annoyance. Then he said, with a disapproving stare, “You should offer yourselves willingly. Be joined together inside my stomach and taste union for once in your miserable lives.”
Elrahet’s crackling laughter, “Oh? Don’t want us to fight back? Does stressed meat taste fouler? Poor thing.”
Greskal grimaced. Tar pooled in his bottom lip. With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, he twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.
“Keep them off everyone,” Moto said to his sister. “I’ll make the killing blows.”
“I’m going to do what I need to do,” Moteah said as she threw down her pack and drew her sword.
Seb was sweating, staring at the door behind to throne room, and beetle-demons who were now creeping down that wall.
Purl tried to slap the terror out of his cheek.
“Wake up!”
Seb looked Purl in the eye, and said, “You insane!? We don’t have a chance!”
Purl slapped him again.
“Seb! Get hold of yourself!”
Seb spat at her feet, and then he took off running towards the throne room door.
It was only a ten steps distance. 
Seb made it five.
A hag jumped off the wall, straight towards him. As it flew, its shell parted open, and a blur shot out of it’s back. 
Seb’s body went limp. A black spike was stuck right through his chest, through his pack, and through the Riga’s swaddled head.
Mandri wanted to scream in horror, but no sound came out of his lungs. Seb fell to his knees, and then to the floor, gargling on blood and borcandi juice as he went. His killer, still clinging to him like a leech, retracted its spike back into its shell with a horrifying—schlick.
Mandri held out his sword as Moto had taught him. His arm trembled. Moto’s lessons didn’t prepare him to deal with an eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis. And there were four of them arrayed in front of him like a pack of a dogs.
“What do I do?” he asked Purl.
“Just stab the damned things!”
The next thought that went through Mandri’s head was that things seem to jump faster when they’re jumping at you.
He shrieked, closed his eyes, and swung out.
He felt his blade hit the beetle’s shell.
There was a squelching crunch.
He was still alive.
The beetle demon was dead at his feet. Its back was absolutely crushed. It’s murderous spike twitched feebly on the floor. 
Mandri’s sword was completely bloodless.
The other three beetle-demons took to the walls and scurried hurriedly back towards Greskal.
Mandri was about to wonder if he had some secret power—then he noticed Ayram standing in the shadow of the throne room doorway. His spud bar’s ball was dripping black with beetle-demon blood.
“Oh,” Mandri muttered. “Thank god.”
Ayram stepped into the hall, and all the hag beetles fled back into Greskal’s domain.
His face, beard, and shoulders were plastered in sand.
Elrahet asked, “What’s wrong?”
“Arm’s useless.”
His left arm was tucked into his robe. Hiding a limp.
“Is that Greskal?” he asked.
“It is.”
Ayram sighed and gritted his teeth. “We don’t have time for this.”
He hoisted his spud bar up on his shoulder and walked towards the putrid king.
Greskal smiled at the sight. “I’ve been expecting you,” he said. “And I have a gift for you.”
“Not interested,” Ayram growled.
“Give me a moment. A moment, and I’ll show it you.”
Greskal rolled his eyes into white and he gave his head a good shake. This seemed to knock loose some internal blockage, and his shoulders shook as a chill ran up his spine. Then a wave rolled under his great bulk like the ocean rolling under a seaweed shore. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder. Couldn’t be called stomach contractions, for they were violent, that Greskal screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered. The wailing the voice ragged by the souls of all of those he’d eaten.
Greskal leaned back and another wave rippled his stomach. A boil burst open, and in its place was a cavity. Blackness oozed out of it, and when the inevitable shudder came this hole ripped wider and a taloned hand burst forth. Out of the amalgamete’s stomach poured a great demon slathered in tar.
Half man, it stood up on two legs. Half lizard, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It was bigger than Ayram by a head and had the muscles of a prize-winning ox. Its eyes were fiery red, double lidded, and its pupils were a cloud of orange. It licked the air with a forked tongue, caught Ayram’s scent, and hissed. Then it stretched out its limbs for the first time, its arms were ribbons of muscle, it’s back a whip of muscle, sinew, and it’s jaw a of black fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself, the coursing power, it curled it’s and seemed to know what it was meant to do; if it didn’t it could read it on Mandri’s face.  Three fingered claw.
It growled, and the vibration sent the hag-beetles clicking and scratching their spikes against the insides of their shells. They turned their dumb, lidless eyes towards the Ayramun.
“Go on, my children,” Greskal wheezed. He winced against another violent spasm that shook his whole body. Then he fainted. Then the hag beetles began again to crawl.
“Get back!” Ayram shouted. “Against a wall!” He twirled his spud bar under his arm and spat a challenge towards the reptilian. A snarl of fangs was the answer, and the demon took a step towards his prey—only one step. It and Ayram were twenty yards apart, but for the speed between them it might as well have been a single step.
The beetles were still clicking their excitement as they scurried wide around these giants. Moto and Moteah herded Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl back into a corner, and between their shoulders, Mandri saw the hag beetles close ranks behind Ayram. They weren’t at all interested in the giant. They kept on creeping along the hall. Some had ascended up into the darkness of the ceiling. Mandri could barely make out the dull shine of their eyes as they took up positions directly above him.
Ayram take a step backwards.
Then another step.
Then all Shis broke loose. 
So much happened so fast that Mandri 
On the floor, three beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, Mandri wasn’t sure because the blur of bodies and limbs and . At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. Before Mandri could flick the tip of his sword, Moto brought his blade down on the hag beetle’s back, and in a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue right behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him down to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though it’s head tumbled to the floor, it’s body wasn’t dead yet. Its a seizure, and its hand-legs spasmed and one of them slapped Mandri in the cheek. Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of another hag beetle up on the ceiling. It dropped. Things fall faster when they’re falling at you.
This beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck and right onto Mandri’s face. Then the beetle’s spike flew out of its back, but the dumb thing missed Mandri’s nose because the beetle’s eyes were on top its head. It struck out again, and missed again. Twice more the spike tap-tapped against the stone.
“Dumb bitch!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that it’s saucer fish eyes were staring down right at him.
“Oh, shit.”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead body between them, and as the spike flew down at his face it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. Tried to pound through it like a hammer, he heard swish-squish and the beetle’s severed spike fell right in front of his nose. The beetle squeaked as a blade jutted through it’s head, right between its eyes.
Purl pulled her sword out and said, “Get up.”
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles. His hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Give me a hand,” he said.
“Really?!” said Purl.
“You’ve got two hands,” said Mandri.
“No, I don’t.”
“You know what I mean.”
Purl kicked the top beetle off him, and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet, wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage; eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smushed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back along the hall, and one of these ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the lizard demon. It was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his dig bar so fast it curved and snapped straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, and the demon recoiled and raged and leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand, then its tail, knocking Ayram’s bar aside as the next set of talons were coming round. Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below the blow, to leave a A and a swirl of dust between them.
Only now that they were standing still could Mandri see how much they’d ravaged eachother. The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe had been clawed to ribbons of flesh hung off his side, exposing the yellow fat, red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time that Ayram exhaled.  
Moteah wiped her sword on the skirt of her robe. 
Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked her rump.
“Help him!” the old witch shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag-beetles easily enough, but the newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!”
Moteah took off running towards the battle. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first.
They got halfway to Ayram when the lizard noticed their coming. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat, its long tail raised like a scorpion. Outnumbered, it slowly retreated down the hall.
“It’s scared!” said Moto as he and his sister took up positions at Ayram’s bleeding side.
Ayram spat a glob of red and said, “Careful. Don’t let it—”
The newborn jumped.
It jumped all the way up to the ceiling, then bounded off it and over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled growl underneath that permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift bounds. Wide-eyed, Mandri stared down his final moments with a terrified calm. Time seemed to congeal, allowing him to appreciate the beauty of his killer. This demon was enormous, strong, sleek, and aside from its flapping jaw, it was perfectly symmetrical. No ugly ears. Its scaly skin glistened in the sheen of its afterbirth. It leaped towards Mandri. The sheer size of it swallowed up. Curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery: it rolled under Ayram’s spud bar, which missed. The lizard’s tail didn’t—it ripped a gash right across Ayram’s exposed stomach.
The lizard crashed into Mandri and sent him sprawling. 
And expecting to see the newborn hollowing out it chest.
It was on the floor, lifeless. 
Elrahet’s blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Ayram sank to his knees. Blood was pouring like a stream from the fissure in his stomach.
Elrahet screamed as she ran and caught Ayram in her bosom.
Moteah and Moto sprinted up behind. 
“Let me see,” said Moto.
Ayram’s strength gave way and he slumped down onto the old witch’s shoulder. Moto and Moteah seized his arms before Elrahet crumbled under his weight, and they all helped him down to the ground. Elrahet gently laid his head down on the stone and wiped away the muck of battle from his brow with her thumb.
“My child,” said Elrahet. “My child…This I can not heal.”
Ayram’s great heads were clutching at his stomach. His breathing was staggered and wet. He looked at his witch, and his eyes were filled with the wonder of a moment long expected. He tried to speak. Elrahet shushed him with a finger to her lips.
“I know,” she said. “I know…I will sing your name to Solraheen, and he will know. He will know.”
Ayram’s eyes darted to Moto. He reached out with his bloody hand and his fingers found the strength to grasp Moto’s hand as tight as vice. For a brief moment, the two men beheld each other, shared an unspoken word, then Ayram’s fingers loosened and the light went out of his eyes.
He was dead.
A gloom passed over
Purl almost a squeak. 
“What do we do?”
No one answered. They all around their leader.
Moteah finally spoke up. “We keep going. For Ayram’s sake. For everyone’s sake, we keep going.”
“Go where?” Moto said through clenched teeth and frustrated tears. “Ayram’s dead. There’s a Mazyd coming. Dumb-ass Seb got the Riga’s head split open, so unless Elrahet can pull a spark out of a mouthless corpse then our Mazyd is as good as useless.”
All eyes turned to Elrahet. That their long mission was at an end.
“Moto is right,” she said. “The Riga is spoiled.”
“Then we have nothing,” said Moto. “And this is over.” He formed his hand into the sign of Solraheen and closed Ayram’s lids. Then he stood up, took a moment to gather his wits, then unsheathed his sword.
“What are you doing?”
Moto pointed his blade at the unconscious Greskal. “I’m going to carve up that bloated fool before that damned Mazyd gets the chance.”
Strange, because here he was, alive yet again despite the odds, this time because of Ayram’s sacrifice. This should have been another reason to, and yet, he felt hopeless. Hopelessness—now that is a complex emotion. 
“This can’t be over,”
Purl looked at him with and simply said, “Don’t.”
“Don’t what? This can’t be over. This is all supposed to mean something. There’s no way this is the end.”
Elrahet all the tiredness hit her.
“There is no ‘end’ Mandri. Nor is there a new beginning. 
“A demon king with a stomach bearing horrors straight from Shis!? That’s—that’s—…Oh.”
“What?”
“Moto! Stop!”
“No.”
“MOTO, DAMMIT!”
“WHAT!?”

“Someone bring the legless Mazyd. And someone get my needle and string.”
She stuffs Obo into Greskals stomach.

            <Text>TODO: Consider cutting on the suicide/pilgrim note, leaving the journey ambiguous. Maybe move it all somewhere else. 
It was nights when he got most emotional.
A companion for those lonely nights where 2am turns to 3am and before you know it, the world moves on and on, as you stare at the ceiling and contemplate everything that went wrong, everything you did and everything you could've done. Just pure melancholy and a gut-wrenching feeling of surrender. 
People that you’ve been before that you don’t want around anymore.





Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. This is a simple matter of fact, for art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see, and Nature’s beauty is 
Inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns. The felsing quars call it infinitely nested beauty, and they say it goes on for as far as it is possible to look. If the mood is right, then shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve. So, there is no point in trying.

Salavan had a son named Mandrameen, and Mandrameen liked art. He wasn't very good, but he liked to paint landscapes, and write flower poems, and make little clay sculptures of women. He was impressed by the things a master could make, and he wanted to be impressive himself. Salavan tried to explain that nothing anyone made was impressive when compared to Sol's creation.
When Mandrameen came of age and continued to show no signs of ‘getting himself together as a man’, Salavan sat Mandri down and told him to go out to the Sand and see the truth of the matter for himself. He said that the Sand has a way of destroying the things that blind a man to his true purpose. 
He said that the desert heat would pull Mandri's mind out from his body, and if he lingered there in the sun, near to death, then all of Mandri’s childish fantasies would evaporate. With his body hollow, Nature’s beauty would pour into him and force him to see the truth about the edge between himself and the Universe. 
Maybe then Mandri would accept the role that the Creator set out for him and all men.
Salavan didn’t think that his son would actually do it, but at the age of eighteen Mandrameen did, he ran away from home. 
Mandri was only a mile out from Shagota when 
“Mandri, Mandri. God-damned, idiot Mandri.”
Only a mile out from shagota and he was already begging to regret his decision. But regret he could deal with, it was the pangs of ___ he could not.

Salavan told his wife it was suicide. He told her not to expect to see Mandri again. But suicide wasn’t the right word for it. It wasn’t the word Mandri used. Suicide carries a sense of purposeless, but Mandri took to the road with a greater sense of purpose than he’d ever had before. He called it a pilgrimage. Most pilgrims die, after all.
The road he took was an old, unused smuggler's road that led west out of Shagota, called the Scuttle Road, and it ran west through the marshlands and then it wound up and over the Hias mountains before wiggling down and into one of the more beautiful parts of Sand. Beautiful according to Salavan himself. It was called the Junei Plain.
Unfortunately for Mandrameen, he was a short, skinny, and too-rich city boy who’d only ever measured out leagues on a map. He didn't know that if you sleep out in the marshlands at that time of year, then you've got to sleep up off the ground or else your flesh becomes a feast for the millions of darkfly grubs that wriggle in the earth. He didnt know that ----. He didn't even know that if you walk for hours and hours, feet sliding around in the sandal, you are liable to get blisters. much less did he know how to prevent a blister from festering.
Worst of all, he didn't know that if you travel anywhere on the Jandri continent then you've got to bring more water than you think you need. Mandri had only brought one large goat skin watersack and just assumed that he’d be able to refill it at wells along the way. But well after well in the marshlands was spoiled by salt and algae. In one remarkable instance, Mandri pulled up a well-bucket, and in it was handful of wet feathers, slimy meat, and bone. 
From that he tried to compose a story about death. About a bird had falling into a well, about how its corpse was busy spoiling the water. 
He figured the well water would look better once he'd gotten out of the marshlands and up into the Hias mountains, but there on the rocky slopes he passed one well without realizing it, and then he couldn’t find the next one, and the one after that was dry.
At that point, Mandri's watersack had been empty for a whole day. He started to get headaches. Not difficult headaches but they were always there and they wouldn't let him sleep. Just as he started to feel the nausea coming on, a miracle occurred - Sol sent clouds down to rest upon the mountaintops. 
These clouds rolled in from nowhere. Perhaps spoken into existence by the Istil wind. They sat so low that Mandri was walking through them long before he reached the Hias peaks. They were so thick that cupfuls of dew collected in every crack and crevice, and Mandri's clothes were so wet from simply being in the mist that he could wring his sleeve and drink from it. 
Mandri took the arrival of this heavenly mist to be a sign, an unquestionable sign, that Sol had blessed his journey. These clouds stayed with him, nourishing him, until he'd gotten through the worst of the mountains and had begun his journey down the other side.

It was a kind of sadness that he only felt at night, at night in a high place, where it was just him and the stars and if he sat and stared at them long enough then the immeasurable distance became a knife that could cut through to his heart. And he let it happen. He indulged it. It is an edge that only cuts if you throw yourself upon it in the most egregious act of self-pity, and that’s what makes it all the worse because you really have to have no self respect to go looking for it. Mandri looked for it because there was all this love in his heart but no one to give it to. 
There were people he could have given it to, but they had passed him up, or he had passed them up - it didn’t matter. He was here now, and all the those chances passed up just for this.
A pang of regret that came on so hard he had to grit his teeth to bear it.
Then his eyes welled up. 
When the sadness started to come in and tear at his chest, he let it. 
Spinning out of control.
When it got to the point where he could hardly breathe, well, he had to breathe, and with the first chestful of air that was the end of it. For all the build up and the pain and the dread, a single breath chased it away. Sometimes it took two. The pain wasn’t all gone; there was always a tightness in his chest that lingered until he woke up the next morning. 

Two days later, coming down the western slopes, and he was again at the bottom of his water-sack. He began again to thirst. Each morning he licked what dew he could from the rock, but it wasn't enough. When he peed his urine almost as  dark as a roasted barley beer, and when little grey lizards heard his tinkling on the rocks they came out, took a sip of it, then spat it right back out and scurried back into the shade.
Then headaches and the nausea returned. One day later and he'd vomited out what little water was left in his body. He'd grown so weak that he was forced to toss his pack and his watersack. It was then that he knew he'd die out in the Sand. He figured that the clouds in the peaks behind him only meant to tide him over until he made it down to the Sand so that he could fulfill his journey's purpose.
To save energy he only moved at night. During the day he'd lounge in a boulder's shadow, and in between bouts of sweatless, fitful sleep he'd take in the beauty of the Sand as it stretched out below the foothills. The sight of it teased him onwards. The Junei Plain was such a vision in the afternoon: a brilliant pastel sea of pink sand dunes, yellow gypsum, and white salt, all swirled together on the landscape like paint on a painter’s palette. He had heard tell of this beauty, he had read poems, seen paintings, but his father was right - it needed to be seen in the flesh. It seemed so impossible. How could the Istil wind not blow it all together and muddy the colors? He was eager for night to come so that he could get moving again.
On Mandrameen's final night the Scuttle Road spat him out at the foot of the mountains. His head was a dizzy mess and there was a dull pain in his mouth, when he put his fingers into it to press down on the pain, he found that his tongue was drying out and shriveling. To make matters worse, there was almost no strength left in his twiggy legs. They had managed a plodding pace for as long as they could. When the road curved down into a shadowy ravine, Mandri misjudged the slope. His legs gave out as soon has he stepped down into it.  
He fell forward, flailing, and he hit the ground hard with his shoulder. Then he slid, rolled, and tumbled down into that road-hewn ravine like a limp sack of potatoes. At length he came to rest at the bottom, sore all over, and completely covered in the ochre dust of clay. 
He was on his stomach, and it took a colossal effort for him to right himself, first to get up to his elbows, and then to crawl up to the bank of the ravine to rest. He did not want to die face down. He did not want to die here. He wanted to die in the Sand.
He tried to stand up again, but his legs wobbled and gave in. Then, with a groan and a sob, Mandri pulled himself up under the husk of a nearby Karkle bush, which was as dried out and nearly dead as he was. It’s thick, sticky branches would offer a little shade from the sun that was coming to end him. 
And then Mandri cried. 
He cried without tears because his body was so starved for moisture. He cried without a sound because his parched throat could hardly bear a whisper. He cried because of the pain, and he cried because he was so close yet so far to that vision of the beautiful Sand. Instead of losing himself in that sacred place he would suffer such a prosaic fate - death in a dark trench, with nothing but rocks, a dead bush, and dead sticks washed into that ravine by ancient rains to keep him company. 
He thought that if he slept then maybe a little strength would return to him. If he were well-rested, he could make one last march down into the Sand. In a few hours, when the morning sun came, he would get up and keep going. So he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
But the morning sun does not come all at once to those foothills. There the mighty Hias peaks cast a long shadow that stretches across the whole of the Junei plain. It takes twelve fingers [fingers is a time-measurement for Jandrians] for the sun to peel the night all the way back to where Mandri slept, and when the sun did finally reach him, it was almost noon. By then he was past the point of no return. He had become a shiska, and His dessicated mind was busy with the triage of his body’s functions. Trivial things like coherent thought made way for his pumping heart, for his labored breathing. He spent an hour like that, lying there in the dappled shadow of the karkle bush, gulping down the dusty, dry air like a fish out of water, not aware enough to even realize that these were his final moments. A whole hour like that, just a sense organ baking in the heat, and then he died.

Many edits were made to preserve clarity. Clarity is GOD. Clarity is something that beginners in any artform don’t quite get, because they aren’t used to looking at their own work with objective eyes. You need to work reallll hard on maintaining clarity of thought and expression. Once you’ve got a good sense for how clear your writing is, you can experiment with more poetic turns of phrase and structure. For example: the transition from “Bart?” -&gt; “The last turning the pang into a bottomless pit.” A clearer version: “Bart? This last name turned the pang into a bottomless pit.”


Also: ‘Black hole’/ ‘pang of sorrow’ / ‘swallowing abyss’ - these are basic/default descriptors for a character struggling with depression. It’s something a middle schooler would write. You need to dig deeper. I’ve tried to just put a basic twist on it so it’s not so transparent.


What i’ve written is good, but it gets the idea across.


Eventually she gave up and defaulted to Ram, because who else was there? The Marquis brothers and their boys? One of their Guards? All of them were brutes who relished violence more than most - not to mention it meant dealing with Jillian. Perhaps Midwife Abi if she was done with the boys. Little Ricket? Each name was more difficult to imagine sitting next to Anna’s than the last. But there was one which trumped them all:
Bart and Anna.
Absurd.
Bart and Despair, more like.
Never someone and Anna. Forever just Anna alone, for her beauty was a siren’s song at the bottom of a bottomless well, enthralling all who wander near, drawing them downward into its depths, downward into sorrow and self-pity, teasing them with faint glimpses of the evanescent Anna. Bart was so deep now that the very thought of her was crushing.

            <Text>, he came at last upon a rocky mountain with a large cave at the foot of it and a large stone over the entrance. After removing the stone and going in, eager to explore the unknown with a human curiosity, he found a spacious chamber, with an opening to the sky above covered over by spreading branches of an ancient palm tree. There was a sparkling spring there, from which a stream overflowed through a little opening, and soaked away into the earth. There were also a few little buildings near the foot of the mountain containing the knives and anvils and mallets used to strike coins; Egyptian writings tell us that this used to be the site of a secret minting factory at the time when Antony and Cleopatra were together.


They ordered another young man in the flower of his youth to be taken into a most pleasant little garden, with white lilies and red roses, and a gentle murmuring stream winding through it, and the wind making a sweet whisper though the leaves of the trees, where they made him lie down on a feather bed, and left him there, tied down with soft silken bonds to prevent him escaping. After they had all gone a beautiful prostitute came in, and began stroking his body in the most delicate of embraces, and, shameful to relate, fondling his manhood in her hands, in the hope of so inciting him to lust that she might win a shameless victory over him. I don't know how this soldier of Christ did it, or how he summoned up his resolve. But will pleasure be the victor where torments fail? For at length, inspired by heaven, he bit off his tongue and spat it in her face as she tried to kiss him. And so the immense pain which followed was stronger than the feeling of lust.

Ayram gives little speech about betrayal or some shit. What will happen to you. 
We all know what punishment for betrayal is. Brought you here to remind you want a heritic/betrayl of the faith gets you. 
YOu all know that I love you, but FEAR OF GOD.
Then does the stabbing example. Puts knife in Sob’s hand. If you should stab him, you must first stab me.
They break down.
Meeting gets interrupted again.
Ayram rushes out to see - Imperials - they haven’t split up. They’ve got to know.
The reason why we split up is because we wanted to see if you were leading them to us.
The rumors of a mind link are true.
How do we prevent it? 
Would Blindfold prevent it? Is it like a homing beacon? How does it work?
It is a being link. We can, with effort, cohabitate. They see what I see, feel what I feel. 
Can you talk to eachother?
Yes.
Then how should we proceed? Kill you is the only way?
Some way of knocking me unconscious.
Elrahet - we have Sel root. Would put him to sleep. If he were human.
Would sel root work?
I am unsure.
Why tell all this? 
You’re barbarians. If I don’t you might do something rash.


Humbling air.

            <Title>The starving artist</Title>
            <Text>
There are so many different kinds of artists that the label ‘artist’ has no real, practical value. A dancer, a poet, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a hole-digger can be an artist too if he digs holes in a way that’s true to himself - whatever that means. Even a tax-man can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of. All tax men artists.
A true artist, though, that is a term of distinction which has nothing at all to do with whatever activity is being performed, whether it be dancing, digging, or finessing balance sheets. The true artist is a true artist because they posses a particular state of mind. In fact, some true artists never actually produce anything in their lives, yet they are true artists for they bear all the hallmarks of artist’s mind: too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and they think far too much of their own tastes such that it becomes impossible to describe them without resorting to sarcasm. 
Mandrameen was such an artist. Unlike most, he actually made things, he was a painter, though that mark does not his as an out-and-out true artist, for in the gallery halls of Hrkan lords his profound turns of language were mimicked by all who knew him, and always these pronouncements were followed up by something like a mischievous wink. 
One might stand in front of Mandri’s work and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then make a show of walking away. Or, “I weep at every stroke of color,” and then flash a knowing smile. All rest comfortably in the knowledge that Mandrameen was a safe target for playful derision, and maybe he was the only safe target, because it wasn’t really him they were making fun of, it was that famous artist’s temperament. After all, it takes a certain kind of person to push through the barbs and put themselves in front of others. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity. 
None of that is actually true, but the truth of it doesn’t matter. The point is that skilled artists tend to be pricks, and pricks tend to say prickish things. 
For example:
“You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.”
This was said by Mandrameen to young Hrkan prince who’d made the mistake of saying he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Lordship be damned, Mandri’s knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if he wasn’t correct in the literal, figurative, spiritual sense, he was at least “more correct” than whoever he was talking to, and that was good enough.
That is, perhaps, the best way to come to terms with Mandrameen, he was a young man who stared reality straight in the face and claimed, with all the certainty of a Solitant priest, that subjectivity does not exist, that he alone had access to a higher truth, because he alone had put in the hours necessary to realize it.
 This miracle of denial seems like it shouldn’t be possible, as almost every person whose ever lived could attest. Two people look at the same painting and walk away disagreeing about its worth. What-are-you-gonna-do. Ask Mandrameen about it, and he’d bob his narrow face and run his fingers through his flouncy hair and he’d say that one of those people was wrong. Maybe both were idiots. He’d tell you who was what once he’d seen the painting for himself.
And Mandri knew he was right because he’d lived all his bright-eyed years being told he was perfect, Solraheen’s gift to humanity, and it wasn’t just his grandmother saying this, it was everyone. They said it because Mandrameen, at the age of ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters. 
These were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brushstrokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait, he observed a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of color he could define the skin, the cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, and even the mood of the sitter. He once painted a woman, cleavage on up, and only used twelve - count them, twelve - strokes. There were few extra strokes to make the eyes glisten, but those hardly counted. Nobody noticed them. It didn’t stop scribes from marveling at how he packed so much information into a neat dozen.
“These are the marks of genius,” they’d say.
Wink, wink.
But all shooting stars eventually fall. The day he woke up with stubble on he chin, he actually heard a woman say:
“Why are we paying attention to him?”
The cause of his disgrace? 
“I refuse debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.&quot;
See, Mandri was a painter, and in such a craft there are limits. Once you achieve a certain degree of skill, everyone is more or less as good as everyone else, outside of true genius, the only thing that separates professionals is how willing they are to ingratiate themselves with governors, princes, and priests. This means that success has nothing to do with quality, or skill - especially not subjective taste - it was about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It was about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. In other words, it was about manufacturing popularity any way that you can. Being the true artist that Mandri was, he refused to play this game. It was a job, and as everyone knows, artists didn’t have jobs.
And yet, this wans’t why Mandri walked away from the craft. The true reason, the thing  was  hallucinogenic drugs. 
The very first time that Mandri picked some brown burgeons, crushed them up, and smoked their juices instead of using them for pigment, he came to a life-changing conclusion: Art was essentially pointless.
Obviously pointless.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. 
That was an undeniable fact.
Mandri had traveled to every city on the holy continent, and he had seen every painting and every sculpture worth seeing and they all fell short of Solraheen’s creation. Naturally, this included his own work - first and foremost his own work. And the problem was always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see. When it comes to Nature, what is really there is complex. If artists were smart, they might be able to approach it, but artists are people, and people are dumb, so they boil that complexity down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible thing which has got them transfixed. In Mandri’s case that usually meant a pretty face or a nice pair of tits (cleavage, the gentleman’s conceit). Maybe it’d be a flower. What matters is that he’d try to rip the thing from the fabric of reality and stitch it to a frame, then he would hold that up like he’d captured and killed what makes life worth living, and people would actually buy it. Some plucky merchant without a brain, who’d lived a life of comfort, would buy it and mount it on his wall. Mandri walk in to see it and be struck dumb by the feeling that the piece was better suited to the floor, next to the sprawling, headless hides of lizards. It belongs with the pretty colors because that’s all it is.
It was absurd. It was boring. The commissions tore at him. Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d have to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf, its complexity, its pattern, its anatomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one - all that complexity, that beauty revealed to him by burgeonsight, was reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if you must paint the leaf, is to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. Maybe remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ hips. And then you’ve really done it, you’ve not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, you’ve erased it from existence entirely.
And it wasn’t just the leaf, it was the rock, the cloud, and the tree, and how it all fit together. Even the sand played a role. The true part of Nature’s beauty, the grandeur and complexity of it, was absent. Maybe one can say that Mandri wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture creation’s essence, but that hardly matters. “Go and try and paint Nature,” Mandri would say to Meskalim’s frightened children during a burgeon binge. “Try reducing that infinitely nested beauty to a still image, to a brushstroke. Take as long as you like. Take twenty five years. Take a lifetime! Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…” 
He’d forget what he was on about, but if he were sober, he would have said this: “And then go and stand at the edge of the wilderness, a place with a big sky and mountains. Smoke some valley burgeons to get in the mood, and then let the shock of Nature’s overwhelming beauty hit the spinal cord. If the mood is right, it will hit with an intensity that no poet or painter could ever hope to achieve.”
So, there was no point in trying. 

Made his real living by giving portraiture lessons to wealth man Vigram Druamalun.
Vigram was an old, burly gentleman with a bald head and long belly-beard that he kept oiled and neatly trimmed. He lived in the countryside, near Meskalim, for he was rich enough to afford a private villa set away from the dirty city, and he could afford to staff it with serving boys and a tiny private army - if twelve skinny men with knobby spears could be called an army. Vigram called them an army. He made them wear a square tin brooch on their robes and this brooch bore his initials.
Vigram could afford all this because he’d made a small fortune as a creditor. He told the story to Mandrameen at lunches, and he’ d tell it in a way so as to suggest to Mandri that he could do it too.
He started with only two ounces of silver as inheritance. Then he loaned those four ounces to two brothers who ran a bakery in Meskalim. This bakery supplied the Solitant temple with bread - a surefire bet, because temples were always the last thing to go belly up in lean times. There were gross accusations of usury against Solraheen Himself, but Vigram got together with the priest and prayed about it around a .
After that, he lent smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who needed emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. He’d split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s budding bond market. There wasn’t much money in Meskalim itself, but it had a busy port and that meant access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, he’d wax on about his many investments, a web of silver that stretched into every corner of the continent, and it was all self-sustaining. Soon he was able to hire people to pour over the lists of sums credited and debts owed, and this allowed him idle hours, which he spent dabbling in the sacred art of the oil portrait.
His favored subject was his young daughter, Ora, who was Mandri’s age. She was the only one of his five children willing to sit for him, and on the present day, Vigram brought out Ora and said to Mandri, “Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?”
Mandrameen nodded politely and said yes, and his eyes flicked to Ora without intention, but Vigram interpreted it as the most rabid of intentions, and the old man’s eyes squeezed a smile and then he gave Mandri a partriarchal nod of blessing. 
Mandri didn’t care much for Ora. She was good natured, but she was a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen, easily twice his size. Her face was fair enough, and she had clean brown skin and a sun-kissed smile, but while she might pass for a fertility goddess, Mandri didn’t want to have kids.
Then Vigram set up an easel on a red-brick patio that abutted his villa’s western wall. Mandri had told Vigram at least four times that this was a horrible place to paint. The patio was enclosed by a diamond trellis that was crawling with vines, and that meant dappled light, and dappled light was horrible for a beginner because the sun moves. It’s easily accounted for in clean light, but with the leafy shadows drifting across the face it’s horrible. Vigram thought he had an artist’s eye, and so he insisted on it. He shook his beard and said, “My dear Mandri, the patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
Mandri didn’t know what that meant, and he didn’t ask. He did what he was told and helped Ora up onto a high-legged chair, and Ora let her sausage fingers linger on his arm, and then Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his subject.
Again, Mandri did as told, and Vigram set himself to mapping out the canvas with a stick of charcoal.
When Mandri got around to see how Vigram was getting on, he had to stifle a burst of laughter, because Vigram was having a hell of a time fitting plump Ora into the frame.
That was Mandri’s fault, though, not Vigram’s (or Ora’s). Mandri had previously told Vigram to try and use the whole canvas, because Vigram had a beginners habit of drawing the figure small and in the center, leaving an awkward expanse of emptiness.
“I think the shoulders should be a little lower,” Mandri said.
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed his marks away with his palm, then tried to readjust.
Once the , Vigram set the charcoal aside, picked up his palette which Mandri had already prepared, and set himself to painting.

There’s a old maxim that says that talented people don’t know how to teache . Mandri thought he understood the reasoning; folks who don’t know think that talented people didn’t have to try to acquire their skills. So, they think Mandri never had to actually learn, and so how could he communicate the secrets of the craft when it all comes instinctively? 
But Mandri knew exactly what was wrong Vigram’s paintings. If there were any difficulties in the communication, it was because the average human being can’t handle an unvarnished critique. So, it becomes an exercise in patience and pretending. Mandri found it was best to start off with a compliment.  
He nodded, and then said “It’s good.”
Then he crossed his arms and his eyes raced around the painting, pretending to take in the interesting observations that Vigram had put there in that blur of muddy color. 
Vigram had a habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes. Oils dry too slow for that, and Mandri had stressed several times for him to get the color right on the palette before he touched the canvas, because that’s what the pallette is there for. But time and time again, Vigram would mix a bluish shade of pink for Ora’s chin. It’s a color that only works for the chin a man who keeps a close shave. Vigram would slap it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes would dart between the girl and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips would curl into a frown and he’d mutter to himself, “That’s not quite right.” Then he’d stab his brush into a slug of red, rub it onto the girl’s manly chin, and of course, that wouldn’t be quite right either. This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
But the colors weren’t Vigram’s core problem. Colors could come later. Before that there was issue of value - the man didn’t know how to handle dark and light to shape dimensions. But even before that, there was the simple act of drawing. One has to be able make a thing look like what it looks like.
Mandri repeated the compliment, because Vigram looked like he needed it. “No really, it’s good. I mean, it’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.” He followed it up with some meat. “But do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to learn to draw hands,” said Vigram, smiling.
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. They both looked at the painting’s hands - the fingers looked like chicken scratches. Mandri couldn’t help but smile. Ora smiled too, awkwardly, a distant third leg in the conversation. 
Mandri said to Vigram, “If you aren’t going take what I say to heart, then what’s the point of me coming?”
“I’m sorry, Mandri, but hands are boring to paint. If a hand had one or two fingers it’d be a different matter entirely. As it is, they’re difficult things to draw.”
“Getting good at anything is difficult.”
“Not for everyone,” Vigram spared him a wink.
“Vigram, if you truly want to get better, you have to fight against the urge to be lazy. You have to want to try, and in painting, what ‘trying’ means is putting in the time and effort to learn how to draw hands.”
“I know, I know.”
“I’ve said this before - when it comes to a portrait, the only things that matter are the face and the hands. You could give Ora forty ribs and a single breast, and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
“You say that, but I feel like next time I come over, you won’t have drawn a single hand.”
“Probably.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his tired brow. He found it difficult to teach when the student wasn’t interested in learning. There’s got to be an existential threat to get better, or else it will never happen.
“Mandri, if you did anything more than laze the days away on your ramshackle farm, you’d understand.”
Before the mood could get too testy, one of Vigram’s spearmen marched onto the patio.
He stopped his feet, like he’d seen hrkan soldiers do, and he said, “I’m sorry to interrupt, my lord.”
“What is it?”
“The young master’s ox is eating the apples.”
The soldier pointed an accusing finger towards the field beyond the trellis, and all eyes turned to peer through the windows in the vines. There, some twenty meters away, Mandri’s golden ox, named Gil, was craning his head up high reach. The beast’s tongue was stuck out and twirling. He was trying to lick the apple stems off the branches, but the present apple was just a little too high up, and his tongue ended up just batting the unripe fruit around.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said, “He’s as much a human being as you or I.”
“Hah!”
“It’s true. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil and shouted, “Gil! Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. He stared back through the vines with that dumb, bovine ogle as the slobber dripped unheeded from his thick upper lip. 
“Gil!”
 Gil blinked. A second later he real Something clicked in his mind and he trotted over, dewflap flapping, ribs seeming to roll underneath his spine.
“Poor old creature,” Vigram muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said, and a ray of strafed his heart as Gil popped his head through a mat of vines. “Hey Gil,” Mandri said, “What do you think of Viddy’s painting?”
Mandri presented the painting to Gil with a flourish.
Gill looked at it.
He gave his grass a chew.
Then he mooed. 
“See!?” Mandri exclaimed.
Vigram looked like he’d been pricked in the bum by a ray of relief.
“Did you train him to do that?” he asked.
“Of course not. Like I said, Gil is as intelligent as you or I.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“He just doesn’t have hands.”
“I should paint him then.”
“If he had hands, do you know what he’d do with them?”
“He’d learn to how to draw hands.”
“That’s exactly what he’d do.”

Ora sauntered over. She put a hand on Gil’s snout and scratched him into a cooing moo.
“He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is.”
“Can’t believe you could pull him away from apples just by calling him.”
“He knows his name.”
Vigram said to Ora, “What do you think of my painting? Doesn’t it look like you?”
Ora eyed the painting with some disdain. Questioning.
“Oh, it’s not that bad, is it?”
“Ehhhh…”
“Ora, your honest opinion.”
“Well… It looks like a person.”
“That’s progress!”
“A frightened person.”
Vigram leaned back and studied the face he’d painted. 
“You do look frightened, don’t you.”
“Maybe it’s just projection.”
“No, I just have trouble with painting eyes. I just don’t have the dexterity in my fingers for needlework.”
“Needlework?”
“That’s what it feels like when I use this tiny brush.” Vigram held up a brush with thin, only a few horse-hairs wide. 
Ora turned to Mandri and asked, “Do you have dexterous hands, Mandri?” 
Mandri’s brows leapt up and 
The man was smiling like he was about to stamp a return on interest. 
Mandri said, “Uh…No, not anymore. I actually haven’t painted a picture in two years.”
“Really?” Vigram interjected. “Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours.”
“Farming.”
It was common knowledge that Mandri’s farm couldn’t grow a weed.
“Ahhhhhh. Next time. Time for lunch.” 
Then Vigram set his pallette down on the wicker end table that held, and he took, leaving Mandri to clean up.
“Why don’t you paint anymore?”
“Well, the truth is, I just don’t think paintings are all that pretty.”
“Wouldn’t that be your fault?”
“Look, I just…” Mandri tried to think of a more palatable excuse. “It’s expensive to paint. Look at this pigment. The canvas. Takes a man a week to . Your dad can afford it. I can’t.”
“Come work for my dad. You’d barely have to do more than scratch at paper.”
He’d stumbled into a trap.
“Ehhhh…”
“Don’t you think your dad’s business is a little… exploitative?”

“Are you dense?”
“No?”
“My dad doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for the lessons is because you would die if he didn’t.”
“Is that how he feels about it?”
“I’ve seen your farm, that’s how it is.”

“I promise, you’ll love it here.”
She set her hands on her hips and said, “You’re not a eunuch, are you?”
“Excuse me, what?”
“All the girls in Meskalim say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came by yesterday, and she said was looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“Couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch. I mean, what? You want me to bare my uglies right here so you can get a gander?”
Ora crossed her arms and gave Mandri an expectant look.
Mandri recoiled . “I’m not actually going to plop my uglies out my robe.”
“That woman said she was looking for a eunuch painter named Mandrameen. I doubt there’s another painter named Mandrameen in Meskalim. Doubt there’s another in the whole world.”
“There might be.”
“I know that those painting guilds in Jeket only train eunuchs.”
“I wasn’t part of any guild.”
“Then what’s your problem, Mandri?”
Mandri absorbed the shock of Oya’s bluntness by squishing up his face and pretended like he had no idea what she was talking about. But Oya was a girl who had no patience for  
“Ora…” Mandri had to play his here. He . “You’re a beautiful girl, but-”
“But what? You go in for boys?”
“No! No. Look, I’m not fit for that kind of life.”
“I could be good for you.”
“Sure, but what do you get out of it?”
“Maybe you’re good for me.”
“That’s an awful big assumption to make. You don’t really know me.”
“What’s there to know, Mandri? You’re just a fucking boy.”
Had to bite down to hide his contempt.
“Yeap. Look…”
Building to a head.
“What is wrong with you?”
“See that’s what I’m talking about! This is what I’m talking about!”
“C’mon Gil.”
He’d made it to Vigram’s swing gate when he noticed Vigram running out to meet him. The old man had to keep his beard tucked under his arm lest it fly up and bother his face.


“What just happened?”
“Oh, it’s nothing.”
“You’ve got her in a tizzy.”
“
“You almost left without your charge.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
“Mandri, it’s my job to worry about on-time payment. Take it.”
“No, it’s fine.” Mandri didn’t know why he was refusing. 
“Mandri, I will get upset if you do not take this money.”
“Okay, you win.”
“But - I want you to promise me you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“Burgeons?”
“Please, I’m not a fool. I know you’ve been buying burgeons from Geem.”
“I haven’t.”
Vigram’s disbelieving eyes.
“I’m going to give you this money, but don’t go and use it to buy more burgeons. Buy some apples for old Gil here.”
“Yeah, okay.”
“You’ve got a gift, Mandri. I’m serious. Solraheen’s given you a gift.”
“Yeah, I know. I’ll see you later, Vid.”
Mandri smiled and 
“I’m serious!” Vigram said, “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, unless that gift was patience. His paintings were famous (regionally famous), for the economy of strokes, but what people didn’t know is that he would spend hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and repeat this for as long as it took. He mixed his paints with a few drops of sap to make the strokes dry quicker so this worked. So, in truth, Mandri’s only real talent, the only thing separating him from everyone else, was his tolerance of tedium. That’s the secret. Talent is just . Some people call that passion, and maybe that’s what it was, but all Mandri knew was that he no longer had it. 
When he and Gil got to the top of a hill that overlooked Vigram’s villa, he saw that Vigram was still standing in his drive, looking after him. Vigram waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons, Mandri!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
“They’re gonna fry your mind!”
Mandri wasn’t about to get into an argument at that kind of distance, so he waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons with the money Vigram had given him, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. Mandri was a little disappointed because the only stuff Geem had were south valley burgeons, decent stuff but the the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle, so the insides had a tendency to dry out quick, too quick for Mandri’s liking, but that was all Geem had so he bought them. Then he and Gil continued along the road, stomping through the wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, until they made it out his dusty farm at nightfall. </Text>

Plainclothed portrait of hrkan lord. Mandri didn’t want to paint all that foppery. Asked if he could just paint him in a tunic like everyone else. Pin drop, lord laughed and assent. Want came was a portrait. Same everyone else, and still the divine right of kings.

Mandrameen wasn’t oblivious to it. He once saw an elder celebrant stand before one his paintings and say, “This work really moves me,” and then made a show of walking away. A shine-bald judge said in turn, “I weep at every stroke of color,” and then he flashed a knowing smile. These men rested comfortably in the knowledge that Mandrameen was a safe target for playful derision, maybe he was the only safe target, because it wasn’t really him they were making fun of - at least that’s what they said when they noticed little Mandri watching them. They said they were making fun of him, but his ‘Artist’s Temperament’, and really, that’s something he should be proud of. They said it takes a certain kind of person to push through the barbs and put themselves in front of others. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity. </Notes>

            <Text>Twin cities of zo and san.

Zo - Caswar king
Mon - lesser king, Mohun king.

Have an extremely spartan society. Strong, well-drilled, well equipped military. Seen as well-put-together. Strict family units. Strong emphasis on arts and sciences. Their tech is a little more advanced than everyone elses.

Mohun is a strict minority, even within the city of Mon. However, the Mohun have infiltrated Zomon society to the point that they are driving affairs.
Their goal is to prevent the entrapment of the divine spark in the material world by bringing about the extinction of all life. 
As such they’ve been searching for the prophesied ‘Mohun’s weapon’, which is said to cause this event. The most popular interpretation of this is a man, whou was infused with mohun’s spirit, and gave birth to a pestilence which nearly eradicated all life.

Mandri asked her how the Soldgi Erg came to be.
“That’s the Great Solgi Erg, boy.”
“My apologies.”
“Only a Great Erg can scour the rib of a continent. And if you remember nothing else of what I am about to say, remember this: no one knows for sure the story of the Erg’s creation. Yes, there are old accounts, said to have come straight from the mouth of Solraheen. These are lies. Yes, there was an age when Solraheen’s deigned to shape his voice into word, so that all could understand him, but that age was long before the age of signs and symbols. Details have been forgotten, some have been added, most, I would argue, are belly-aching lies. And if there’s a second thing that you remember, it should be this: Solraheen made those mountains of sand a long time ago, back when he walked the earth alone. That is all that can be said for the truth of it. Everything else is in doubt. Even the very name is in doubt. You know those mountains as the Great Solgi Erg for you were brought up by Solitants. But those mountains have other names. Which is the true name? Who can say?
“The Solitants say that Solraheen planted a stick in the ground to mark one of His garden’s six corners. Then he left to who-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. His passing along the surface of the earth kicked up the first wind, the Shulsai, and this breeze circled the earth and came back around to puff upon that planted stick. 
“Not too long after, a little embryo of a sand dune was built up in the stick’s lee. Another little after, and that dune had grown up to swallow the stick whole. You see, Mandri, sand attracts sand attracts sand. All it took was that one dune, and soon the Primal Erg was belly-full and rolling across the surface of the world, leaving littler ergs in its wake.
“Not everyone agrees that Solraheen meant to do it. Solraheen plants a stick in the desert, the sand piles up, a sand sea forms; was it on purpose? Your Solitants think it was. How could it be any different? Solraheen does not make mistakes.
“But as I said, there are those who believe it was a mistake. Believe it or not, these people used to outnumber the Solitants. Yes. It was the Solitants who were heretics then. The old dogma had a different name for the Great Solgi Erg, for ‘gi’ means gift, and to them, the Erg was no gift. They called it the Great Solzima Erg—zima means…there’s no good word for it in the common tongue…zima is a kind of shame.
“These Old Believers claimed that if Solraheen had intended for the dunes to form, he would have built them with his own two hands, as he did with everything else in his many other gardens. And what’s more is, why should He want to turn good black earth into a mountain of sand? They could not believe that He could wander off into the middle of the world to shape lakes that reflect the light of the divine, give creatures an beauty, and yet at the same time, he left the Erg to struggle up on it’s own, a basic sameness of stuff with no redeeming qualities? All it did was procreate and ripple the wind. Hah! Same could be said for humans.
“The heretics would go on to say that when Solraheen made it back around the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent and saw what he had accidentally wrought, he fell into a deep despair, and that’s why we have ___. Then he up and left. He gave up.”
 Mandri interrupted, “That can’t be what happened.”
“Oh?” said Elrahet. “Were you there to see it? Go out into the Sand and see the rolling dun for yourself and despair.”
“So you’re saying they’re right?”
“The Solitants have a different story. They claim that Solraheen knew the winds, he knew the appetite of the sand, for He made them. They say that Solraheen, in his infinite wisdom, knew that his hands could only make certain kinds of things; the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, you and me, but this was not enough to satisfy his creativity. He is the ultimate creator, and he delights in different mediums, and so he set the forces of the wind and sand into action with, and from this came the dunes. 
“See how Solraheen’s golden light shimmers across Sand? And think of the variety. There are tidal dunes in the lee of hills, echo dunes on the windward side. Crescent dunes, snake dunes, crater dunes rimmed with grass. Go to the and marvel at the array of arcs spanning , or the straight ridges of Seedra, drifting across the desert with mathematical elegance. There are stripes, domes, duckfeet, hairpins, scallops, stars, all varying in size in temperament to rival any family of flowers. 
“The dunes are pigment, the wind is the brush, and Solraheen’s mind is the hand which sets them in motion. As the Dunes move they create themselves and everything else. As they drift across the plain their sand shapes rocks, they grind away at the rough edges and leave behind lumps like feces. some of these rocks are perfectly globular things. Solraheen said that they are alive just as we. , but it has purifying heart. It teaches us lessons if we’re willing to listen, it will grind off our rough outer edges.
Plant a leg in the sand, as Solraheen planted his stick, and the wave you create will become a mountain, it’s passing will resound throughout eternity. That’s the first lesson. Mere existence is enough to change the world.
It was a nice thought, but Mandri would always wonder, “Change the world, sure, but change it for the better?”
Obo challenges storytelling abilities. They think he can’t tell stories.
I can tell stories. 
About a witch, maybe you knew her.
“There was a cantankerous witch who dwelt in a cave where the sea meets the Saki desert. She gained fame throughout the land for her talent of divination. If a person caught a karkoot lizard, and brought her its stomach in a jar of brine, she would fortell their future. So great were her talents that people hunted karkoots until there were none left, though that’s not what this story is about, that’s just an aside to highlight the shortsightedness of the kind of creatures which populate this story.
“One day a young man went to see this witch, but long before that, he was a carpenter’s son. His father, the carpenter, wasn’t rich, for he was a carpenter. Woe betide, his son was a profligate child—that means he was wasteful. Whether it was beer, women, or friends, he spent his father’s money without concern. He had no respect for his father’s work. In a way, you can’t blame the boy. Most of his life he was too young to understand how hard his father worked, and when he was old enough to know, the father’s efforts were out of sight because the father had paid for schooling in another city in the hopes that his son would surpass him in society.
“So, the son, living in a different city, he takes the father’s money that was meant for his education, and he spends it on beer, women, and friends. His life’s prospects quickly come to nothing.
“When the father finds out that his own son has beggared them both, his rage…his rage is profound. It might be hard for you two to understand because you don’t have children-“
“Neither do you,” said Mandri.
“Yes, but you see, we Mazyd are supremely empathetic creatures—not that you aren’t, it’s simply different. Let me try to paint the father’s rage for you…I think you two, considering your present circumstances, have some sympathy for the idea that human life is some kind of mistake. It lacks purpose. Contrast that with me, not only was I built for an explicit purpose, I know what it is. You, however, you must have a nagging sense of the absence of yours. At least we can say that it is not at all clear what that purpose is — the Solitants admit as much? I would argue that it’s clearly obvious that you have no purpose. I can prove it.”
“Hogwash.”
“Think of it like this, if you ever find yourself blessed with wealth and health beyond comprehension, what happens to you then? I can tell you what happens as I’ve seen how wealth impoverishes first hand through the eyes of the lives of Hrkan royalty. Without anything to distract them, one would think they would be happy now that they’re swimming freely in their natural purpose, but that’s not what happens, what happens is that they become bored. Totally bored. A boredom so thorough and complete that some kill themselves. That might be hard four you to understand for you all, but I speak the truth. The boredom is complete. And what does that mean if a person, free from the indignities of discomfort, resorts, naturally, to boredom? It means that you have no intrinsic purpose, for if you had one, surely your natural state would reflect it.”
“What does any of this have to do with the carpenter?”
“Mandri, this the backdrop to every human struggle. You see, human purpose is crafted, and that means it’s something you can lose. And I put it to you that losing your purpose is the greatest horror a human can experience. Don’t smile, Mandri, you of all people should know this. You’re so scared to lose your purpose that you won’t even make one in the first place. You’re sitting firmly in that quarter of all people who got burnt when they were young and have let that little taste of horror clam them up for the rest of their life. This isn’t a value judgment, in fact I think you’re sane to clam up. Your just unlucky that you aren’t part of that quarter of all people who are so inured to the vagaries of life that they don’t ever think about their purpose. Then there’s that other quarter, the religious types who hide their purpose in the metaphysical realm, so by definition it can’t be lost and so they don’t have to worry about it. Then there’s the rest, those intrepid souls who set out and try to make their purpose clear. Most of these settle with making their family their purpose. The carpenter was such a man. His son was his purpose in life. To borrow a figurative turn from the poet Sovrabeen, his son was his challenge to the void. And he lost. And it wasn’t taken from him, it was squandered. If his son were killed he could have moved into grief, but no, the father had challenged the void and the void had answered back by corrupting his son, turning him into the living embodiment of a life’s wasted labor. At least, that’s how the father saw it. How could he see it different? As Seb might say, the carpenter was who he was. And what did he do? He made a coffin and sent it with a messenger to his son. Inside the coffin was a note from the father which said, ‘You are going to die’. 
“To put it lightly, this message greatly disturbed the son. He might have been a wastrel, but a self-obsessed wastrel was he. He saw the coffin and the note and realized that he didn’t want to die, much less did he want to be killed by his own father. He began to see his old man in every shadow. He couldn’t enjoy himself. He couldn’t go to taverns, or whorehouses, he couldn’t sleep in the same place twice. This was no way to live, so what did he do? Well, he was a wastrel, he couldn’t confront even the thought of a confrontation, so he decided to run away and find a witch fix his problem for him. If a witch could predict his future, then he could, he hoped, formulate a plan to avoid his father’s wrath. 
“So, he found a karkoot lizard, stuck it in a jar of brine, and set off to see the cantankerous witch.
“When the wastrel finally set foot in the witches cave, he said to her, ‘My own father is trying to kill me. What should I do?’ Unfortunately for him, this was the wrong kind of question to ask, because the old witch dealt with facts, with certainties about the future. She wanted to hear questions like, ‘What will happen on third full moon?’, or, ‘When will the rains come?’, that sort of thing. When someone came along asking for general advice, like, ‘What should I do?’, suffice to say, she didn’t like it, and hers was a silent, vindictive anger. She smoked up and did the whole song and dance for the wastrel son, and when she was done she said to him, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’. It was needlessly ambiguous, but that was the point, as I’m sure our dear Elrahet can attest.”
“Watch it.”
“I mean no offense. You see, this witch was old and long in the trade, as you, and she knew what kind of customer this wastrel was and how her response would weigh on him. And it did weigh on him. He heard the witches words and jumped to the conclusion that his father was waiting just outside the cave, and that the ‘first thought’ that would enter his head would be his father’s blade. So he didn’t leave. He stayed right there in that witch’s cave and refused to leave.
“The witch, of course, tried in vain to shoo him out. Her plan had backfired. She was stuck with this wastrel who was convinced that the moment he left her cave, he would be struck dead. The witch tried to tell him that his father couldn’t be sitting right outside her cave for all eternity, but the son didn’t buy it. It’s not that he thought his father was always watching the cave, but that, in the haunted speculat of the superstitious, whenever he decided to leave, that’s precisely when his father would show up.
“The witch eventually gave up trying to convince the boy that he could safely leave, and she told him that he could stay if he did chores for her, like scrubbing the cave floor, making fires, cooking, and whatnot. So the son stayed. After many, many years of this arrangement, the witch eventually died, and the carpenter’s son succeeded her because he had been, unknowing to them both, the witch’s apprentice. He had learned how to divine the future by watching the witch read the folds in fish stomachs. He had, on accident, become his own man with his own profession. The witch was dead, but people kept coming to the cave anyways. It is said that this wastrel’s divinations transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, for even kings would seek his sight to plan the courses of their wars.
“The great irony of all this is that the note the carpenter sent to his son was not a threat. If you remember, the note in the coffin said, ‘You are going to die’— that was a mere statement of fact; everybody dies. The father had no intention of hunting down his son. So there’s a sweetness in the knowledge that a simple reminder of what was coming did more than anything the father could have done to shape his son’s life. I don’t know if the father lived long enough to discover that his son had become a great diviner and shaped the course of history, but I like to think that the abatement of his despair would have been most sublime, for he had, unknowingly, triumphed against the void.” 
Silence, the story wasn’t half-bad, but no one wanted to admit it.
Mandri said, “I wonder if the witch knew that the wastrel son would become her successor.”
Elrahet said, “Of course she did. She was a diviner. She divined the future and knew what to say to make it happen. The carpenter’s son was as much her son as the carpenters.”
“Then why did she try to convince him to leave?”
Purl said, “It’s part of the telling, Mandri, don’t think too much about it.”
“Well, it’s a poor telling.”
Obo’s eyes lit up. “You think you can do better?”
“I do.”
“Then 
“I know a story about a son. A godly son. Upright in his parent’s eyes and in Solraheen’s. That is, until the day he met a girl.”
“Typical”, Purl groaned.
Shameful to relate, the story of a young man kidnapped by demons to a satin bed. The demons stroked his body in the most delicate of embraces, and fondled his uglies with their half-human, half-animal appendages, so as to win a depraved victory over him. Inspired by the grace of Solraheen, the young man bit off his tongue. The emphatic pain, and then the coldness of death, rescued him from his lust.
You are the poorest person I know. You suffer from a poverty of thought.


They asked Purl if she had any stories to tell. She flashed a meek smile and said no. Mandri and Obo wouldn’t have it. Mandri said that he would bet the weight of Purl’s pack that she knew at least one story. Obo said that stories are what human beings do, so it was impossible that she shouldn’t know any. But the issue wasn’t that Purl didn’t know any stories, it was that she didn’t like how excited she got when she told them.
“You know what,” said Purl, “I’ve got a story about a different kind of son. It’s a story about the son of a red-crowned lizard. And red-crown lizards, if you don’t know, like to live in mounds made out of their own shit.”
“That’s not quite true,” said Obo.
“It is in this story. This lizard family—a mother, father, and their forty children—they lived in a mound made entirely out of their own poop. Whenever someone had to poop, they looked for a wall that needed mending and they let loose. Then the sun sun baked the shit into a shit brick and that was that.
“Charming,” said Obo.
“Now, one lizard son didn’t like living in a mound a shit. His parents asked him, ‘What’s wrong? Why don’t you like it here?’ and the son said, obviously, ‘because this place is a mound of shit.’ The father pretended to laugh, and said, ‘Very funny. Now go fix the front door’.
“This lizard son was dutiful son, and so he did what his father commanded, he lifted his tail and pooped on front door. Still—he didn’t like living in a mound of shit. He went back to the father and said, ‘Why can’t we be like the finches, who live in cups of sticks and moss? Why can’t we be like the rats, who live deep underground in burrows? Why can’t we be like the humans, who live wherever they want?’
“The father said, ‘We do not have wings, so where are going to get sticks and moss? We do not have digging claws, so how can we dig into the earth? We do not have beer, so how can we live wherever we want? No, my son, we have to count on what we do have, and what we do have is poop. Now go chew a hole in the living room wall, we’re looking to expand.’
“Dutifully, the son chewed a hole in the living room wall. His mouth was full of his family’s leavings, and he realized, now more than ever, that he didn’t like living in a mound of shit. He decided then and there that enough was enough and he was going to leave. So he wiggled out and set off into the desert.’
“He didn’t return home for five years, which, for a red-crown lizard, made him old enough to be a grandfather. His parents were long dead. One of his lizard sisters now owned the mound.’
“The sister, trying to be a most gracious host, invited her long lost brother inside for dinner. The brother declined. When the sister asked why, the brother answered, ‘Because you live in a mound of shit. I’ve traveled the world and have slept in the houses of birds, and rats, and humans, and I’ve even snuck into a snake’s den! None of them were so foul as this.’
“The sister said, ‘Come now, brother, it’s not that bad. We’ve added a second floor.’ The brother said, ‘No thank, you,’ and he left. As he left, he heard his sister shout at one of her many children, saying, ‘The floor should be clean enough to eat off!’
“The old brother was sad at this parting. After all the glorious homes he’d seen, it hurt to see his sister and her family living in such squalor. He decided to do something about it. He thought that all they needed was a push out the door and they’d see for themselves that a mound of shit is the worst kind of house to live in.
“So he journeyed back to the snake whose home he’d snuck into. This time, however, he revealed himself to the snake. He said to the snake, ‘I know you want to eat me, but if you can hold your appetite, I will lead you to a mound of shit that is crawling with lizards. It will be the easiest feast of your life.’
“The snake was skeptical. It asked the old lizard, ‘Why would you betray your kin like this?’ And the lizard said, ‘I will you lead you there on the condition that you promise to leave at least one boy and one girl alive, so that they can carry on the family name. Also, and this is the most important thing, you have to completely destroy that mound of shit.’
“The snake wasn’t sure if he wanted to do it. He had no arms and legs, so if he wanted to destroy the mound he’d have to roll around in it. But the promise of an easy meal was too good to pass up, so he said to the old lizard, ‘lead on’.
“The lizard led the snake back to his sister’s home, and the snake did what he promised. He ate the sister and her husband, and most of their children too, and he rolled around in the pile of dried shit, crushing it into dust.
“Only two lizards survived. A boy and a girl. Without a home they were forced to wander around in the desert. Their old, kinslaying uncle followed them from afar, eager to see how they fared, but not wanting to intrude on their new lives and the experiences that awaited them. 
“Eventually, the young brother and sister got tired of not having a permanent home. The girl said to her brother, ‘I just want my own bed to sleep in.’
“The boy said, ‘I wish the same. We should build a house.’
“‘How do you build a house?’
“‘I don’t know. What was it grandfather was always saying?’
“‘He always said that all we’ve got is our poop.’ 
“And it just so happened that right next to them was a brick of poop that one of them had left sitting there from the day before. And I’m sure you know what happened next—the two lizards built a new mound of poop to live in.
“Now, when the old lizard saw that his niece and nephew had reverted back to the old ways, he became distressed. He wandered back into the snake’s den, and the snake, surprised to see him, asked him, ‘Why have you returned?’ To this the old lizard replied, ‘Because they can’t think of anything else but shit.’ Then the snake ate the old lizard, and that’s the end of the story.”
Mandri screwed up his nose and said, “That’s not how that story goes.”
Purl sneered back. “That’s how it goes, because that’s how I said it.”
Mandri tried to appeal to Obo for an unbiased judgment, but Obo said, “Purl’s right. The storyteller makes the rules.”
“Fine,” said Mandri. “But it’s a little contrived for my tastes.”
“What does that mean?”
“Well, It’s about Hrk, isn’t it? Hrk is the mound of poop. Civilization is the mound of poop? Everyone is just too inured to that way to imagine a better way of doing things?”
“You said it, not me.”
“Oh come on, that’s exactly what it means.”
“You’re the artist. You would know wouldn’t you?”
“Your damned right. And let me give you some advice: good art leaves room for ambiguity. That’s why nobody likes an allegory. They’re boring. It’s too obvious, and if an idea is obvious, it dies out in a generation.”
“I thought you said there’s no such thing as good art?”
“I did. But that’s another matter altogether.”
“Whatever.”


This thought possessed as he walked with the Ayramun. The sand crunched underfoot, and his footprints little humps in the flat faces, and he wondered if these were enough to build dunes themselves.

Mandri had died disbelieving the Solitants, but now he wasn’t sure. That sandstorm was the most incredible thing he’d ever seen in his life while sober. And the colors were special, too. Colors in themselves aren’t that interesting, they’re beautiful for a passing moment before the mind turns to , but he was coming around to thinking that what the Solitants said about the desert’s beauty was fundamentally true. At certain times of day the Sand had stark qualities all it’s own.
It just wasn’t beautiful when the sun directly above.
Or when the wind was blowing too fiercely. 
When the sun was up, the only thing to see was the sad shadow of the ground. And when the wind blows, the sand accumulates. Sand attracts sand attracts sand. It gets into the , under the nails. It choked and stifled, narrowed the world. And this was a real bummer because when the weather was fine, there were things in it to see.

A half-buried carven monkey from some ancient age. Chilling in the.

A half-buried corpse of a lizard.
	A half-buried living lizard. Moteah said it was called a , and she said the creature could live unmoving under the sand for years and years until a rain came, and it’d wake up, mate, lay eggs, and the return to it’s somnolence.

Purl said there were creatures in the sand that, if you can believe it, didn’t need to drink water. They could drink water, they knew how to find it, but if and all the roots dried out and all the rivers into cake, then they could feast on these little nuts called, and that alone would keep them alive. ANd it’s only a certain kind of nut. There’s other nuts, but only that one.
Mandri asked if the nut had water in it, and Moteah said no.

There were things called weeping dunes, large weeping dunes from which water seeps to the surface. Mandri doubted the story. He walked across them and never saw any water. The ground under his feet was dry as far as his toe could dig.

Moto said that men died crawling around weeping dunes, trying to sop their dried tongues on the damp sand. He said it’s not a source of water that’s easy to access.

Mandri told Purl about Gil.

The first night, Ayram said he had to sleep up off the ground. Mandri asked why and Ayram said that he was better off not knowing. Everyone agreed that it was best he didn’t know. They made him sleep atop a . Little saucers that they filled wtih water. Little lizards would come in sip, and when Mandri pointed out that they were sipping, Moteah said to shoo the lizards away and keep filling the saucers with water. Mandri thought it was all a prank until he saw a glistening.

Ayram told Seb to not venture so far ahead. He said that from now on, “We need to stick together.” Seb became prickly after that. Would only respond to his name with a despondent sneer.

Here’s a lucky stone. A hollow tube of rock scrubbed smooth by sand. When Moteah poured water onto it, it’s ruddy surface took on the sheen of glass. Obo said it was a petrified reed.

There was a deep well, quarried, with stairs zig-zagging down the to the bottom at 200 feet. The wat brackish water and pulling out fish, blind fish with pulpy membranes were there should have been eyes. That night they cooked the fish on a 

There arose a learned argument between Seb and him own damn self. The premise: If you put a live fish in a barrel filled to the brim with water, the water does not overflow, but if you put in a dead fish, the water does overflow - this argument went on for a long time until Obo asked if Seb had ever tried do it for himself. Seb hadn’t, so he filled a bowl with water, and found that in either case, the bowl overflowed. He did not know what to make of this.

On the fourth day they crossed a natron flat two miles long and as many wide. It was dry . Seb broke off small chunks of the white stuff and rubbed it on his few remaining teeth. Mandri knew it as a material used in variety of pigments, though he’d never seen a lake of it. A tiny amount mixed in with quartz sand and copper ore made a blue called Campor Blue, called as such because the most vibrant blues came from Campor, where more than an hundred slaves spent their days sorting the quartz sand for impurities grain by grain with tweezers. Only the cleanest, purest grains of crystal were worthy.
Purl found this fact distasteful. 

At night, body still, he could hear Purl breathing and his libido in his ears. He realized why Solitant nibs spewed so much ink to cover the subject of lust.



Dunes drift across the desert but that’s not an apt description of how they move. The masses themselves drift, but the actual pieces of sand of which they are composed to not drift, or slide such distances. Instead, the strong winds whips the grains of sand into ballistic arcs to barrage whatever lies downwind. The accumulation and so the greater mass seems to but while the waves move, the ocean itself does not.

The wind is allways blowing west, leaving Mandri to wonder how the dunes replenish themselves if they’ve been pouring westward into the sea for a millenia.
He asked Obo this, and Obo said that if it were left alone, it Sand would indeed blow itself into the sea. Mandri asked how long it would be until the desert was completely gone, and Obo said it depends.
On What?
On whether or not the herds of Jeket and other Hrkan cities could be made sustainable. On whether or not the axes stop coming for the trees. Bare ground gets trampled and this compacts the soil, dries it out, reflects the sun’s heat, burns the air, sears the air from rain, and then the wind picks up sand and adds it to the Ergs.
If all the people and all the herds suddenly died?
It would take ten million years for the desert to disappear.
Mandri was relieved to hear such a large number, even if Obo had pulled it out of his ass. It meant that there wasn’t much of a difference between a world with people in it and a world without them. Either way the desert would be there, a little bigger or a little smaller, it didn’t matter. The world would end long before ten million years had come.
The common thread of Obo’s ramblings was that he didn’t think highly of human beings. Most of it made sense to Mandri, every mind capable of reason is preoccupied with justifying its own existence.
Mzydobo liked to point to the kind of societies that humans made if left without a Mazyd keeper.
In the age of city temples, there was an Old Jandri custom that forbade anyone from selling land. The purpose was good-natured, as the wise sages of that age had enough history to diagnose the terminal disease of every city - concentration of wealth, precipitating bloody revolution. The idea was that in preventing the sale of land, a family could persist for generations regardless of what wolves were up to. Land changed hands only through inheritance. If an old, childless couple found their work too heavy, they could adopt a few straight-backed persons to till their fields and reap the harvests, and the children could keep it on the condition that they provided grain, oil, and clothes to their parents for as long as the old folks lived.
And what happened to a system of laws so sensibly conceived? Rich landlords seized upon it, bribing judges, capturing councils, and by hook or by crook they forced the poor peasants adopt them as sons, and thus they devoured all arable land by due process of the law.
This practice of consolidation carried on for more than one hundred years. What began as a few rich, wicked schemers evolved into wicked consortiums of “sons” - shared pools of silver and gold from which the poor were forced to drink in times of drought. Such was the upward flow of land, that a single man was once the adopted child of five-hundred and fifty-two different sets of parents. 
This was the birth of the Old Jandri banking system, and it set the stage for the demise of all of Old Jandri’s tribes, for what it spawned could have been predicted by Jandri’s sages: poor unruly masses, feuding tribes, civil war, all expertly exploited by the Hrks.

How do archaeologists find the ancient city? Every mound of dirt is a city. I have yet to find a place in the land of iraq, except in the newly formed delta, on which one can stand and not see two or three cities clearly outlined on the horizon. The worry is not how to find one, but which to choose.
build a little mound of clay that would raise the foundations of the houses a trifle above the level of the ground. We thus have beginning of the mound. The houses were built with walls of unbaked bricks and plastered with clay. The roofs of the private dwellings were generally thatched and covered with a thick layer of clay that prevented the rain from filtering through. Each year, the plaster on the outside walls had to be renewed. The roofs also got a fresh coating of clay. All the clay that had been washed down from walls and roof was depositedi nthestreet, so the street level gradually increased in height. Also, no provision for the disposal of refuse, if one ate shellfish, the shells were thrown into the street to remain there. If a change was made in the plan of a house, all the bricks would go into the street.

Stillness - but the desert is not still. As a shaping force, the wind has a quality that water lacks: the ability to flow uphill. From the pinnacle of a dune a skein of spindrift is spun into the sky; along a dune-brink, a hundred tiny cyclones shimmy in line; a sheet of sand scuds over a ridge like a spool of paper rushing through a press. —stolen

Pushing back against Obo’s misanthropy was a difficult thing to do with the Mazyd strapped to his back. Mandri well tell Obo that Mazyd’s weren’t doing such a splendid job. 

Paintings on rocks of bestiality.

Moteah said the Jeketian fathers suffered from Acedia - the state of not caring or not being concerned with one's position or condition in the world. Mandri couldn’t believe there was a word for it. Who feels like that and thinks to make a word for it? Just fucking die and let everyone else go on being human.

Sand is cool beneath the surface.

Obo said that the sand is quartz; anything softer would be ground to dust within a decade. Mandri said the case, then what are the blue maker’s slaves doing in Compor. Obo said that was just a marketing gimmick. Mandri said it wasn’t, that he knew vibrant blues, and Obo  Each surface grain accumulates a rind of ferric oxide, and it is this that accounts for the arabian dune’s characterisitic redness. 

The strangest thing was a butterfly, of a kind he’d never seen.



Big section where Mazydobo explains to Purl.
Fucking asshole.
No, it’s a good thing.
The reason you cannot control me is because you are too kind. You don’t really want to kill people.
I’ve killed people.
Yes, but you didn’t want to do it. You understand? You have a soft character, Purl. Out here that might be an insult, but in the grace that is the most precious thing. 

A solitary christian grave could be made out, with its double headstone, epitatphs sand-scoured to illegibility. 

The way a lizard looks at you without really looking at you, head flat against the ground, eye swiveled all the way up in it’s socket to stare at the giant Mandrameen. , ever vigilant, ever alert. There was nothing around, but it didn’t know that. A lizard’s life must be exhausting, Mandri thought, having to be on-guard the whole day through, from moment to moment, because it just doesn’t have the presence of mind to be able see into the near future.

A of poop-tails thousand strong. Mandri woundered aloud why they piss on their tails, and Obo said that when it gets too hot (and it always gets too hot), Piss-tail lizards cup their hind feet, and then evacuate their cloacal contents onto them, allowing them to rub their tails in it, and they do this so that when they raise their tails into the air, the water evaporates, and in so doing, draws the heat from the body. Seb overheard this, gargled urine to lubricate the throat. Because when the heat dries out the throat. Desert normalizes body functions, stops being gross, because the body is one the few things that exists.

Under my feet are some holes which have been burrowed by foxes and jackls. At night they descend stealthily from their haunts in their difficult search for food, and appear silhouetted against the sky. This evening they appear to sense my presence and stay in hiding, perhaps wondering at t his stranger who has come to disturb their peace. The mound is covered with white bones which represent the accumulated evidence of their hunts.
A lizard is now sending forth his howl, half-cry and half-threat. All the dogs of the arab village immediately take up his challange, and for a moment the peace is upset by howling and barking. 
I should like to find a reason for all this desolation. Why should a flourishing city, the seat of an empire, have completely disappeared? Is it the fulfilment of a prophetic curse that changed a superb temple int oa den of jackals? probably we ourselves and our own achievents may becom an object of search for peoples to come?

It seemed to me that the chief characteristic of night in the desert was not darkness but this light that was not the sun’s.

For the majority of the journey was spent with his head shrouded in a burnoose. Bleak and tedious sameness.

They took up a southeast Charnel road called the Hafthir road. A lot of pilgrim skeletons on the Hafthir. One of these skeletons was walking, southeast as well, and Ayramun overtook this hobbling creature with. The man stared at them with winkless eyes, his was like skin like paper, and his ribs were countable through the window in his yellow haircloth habit, his emaciated stomach was sucked in to his vertebral column.
This pilgrim thought Ayram was Solraheen enfleshed. Ayram paused, sponged water onto the old man’s lips, and they made a brief, whispered exchange which Mandri could not hear. Moteah told the pilgrim that there was a well just a day to the west if he could make it. The pilgrim said thanks, but he’ll keep to the road.
Mandri gave the pilgrim one of Seb’s rocks.
Their passing put a joy in the pilgrim’s eyes. His eyes betraying that this was his final test, and dessicated, a tear of joy that he was done.

Uprooting huge bushels of twigs. Everyone looked like a porcupine.

Mandri wondered ifhe were the only person to come backk from the dead, only ayram.



Potentially have Moto set up a story about a gladiator.

Moteah a story about the politician woman.


After a week they came into to the Tib desert, or the Black desert, for it was a black plain with a hard floor of small stones tarred in rock-varnish. These stones were inset into the earth, and tightly interlocked like a Hrkan road.  
In the hours of the afternoon sun, the rocks underfoot were hot enough to blister bare skin in seconds. The stones were smooth, but such was the heat that traveling here would wear holes in the shoes. And this seemed to slow their progress.
They walked the Tib, south and east, and day after day they moved forward and nothing changed. Always the same,  



Nights in the Tib were spent huddled around three twiggy fires. It wasn’t the heat that provided comfort, though the nights were cold, it was the smell, for suspended above these miniature fires were a tin bowls filled with scented wax, smelling of carrion, and in the mornings, the hardened wax would be thick with the fuzzy brown bodies of cusiloe flys who were looking for meat in which to implant their eggs.
The flies live in the earth, squeezed deep into the crevices of the interlocking rocks, and the odors of flesh, living or otherwise, draws them from hibernation - but only at night. Like reasonable creatures, they don’t come out to bake in the sun.
As soon as the red lip of the sun peeks up in the east, everyone rises and checks themselves to make sure they hadn’t been impregnated. If a fly did get under the skin, and the eggs were allowed to hatch, removing them would be a painful ordeal, potentially fatal. Seb described the larvae - pulsing white thumbs with two fangs the length of fingernails. Pull them out and they can rip the flesh and leave a hole that will get infected. You look for them by feeling. Skin is too dark to see the soft little welts, especially Moto and Moteah's skin, so you’ve got to feel around for a hardened, coin-sized bump, like a callous on the palm, but maybe it’s on your thigh, on your prick, in your armpit, upon your back, and since you can’t reach your back you’ve got to have someone else do it.
Moteah and Moto checked each other. Ayram and Elrahet checked each other. Mandri smiled at Purl but this was not reciprocated. He was paired with Seb, and neither were happy about the arrangement, Mandri because Seb’s fingers were oily, and Seb because he thought Mandri might miss a . 
Moteah checked Purl’s back.
Nobody checked Obo. He said the flies wouldn’t bother him.
They’d scrape the paste of dead flies from the surface of the wax, save them for food, and then they’d be on their way again, a short sprint in the half-light hours betwixt the sun and the moon. When the sun rose again, they’d stop, pitch little shelters, and rest until worst of the heat had passed.
It was a lurching way to travel, and it felt to Mandri that they made no progress. Day after day and scenery did not change at all. To the north, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see. To the south, a flat plain for as far as the eye could see. To the east and to the west it was the same - flat for as far as the eye could see. They’d walk at a hurried pace for hours, they’d stop, and Mandri could swear he saw the same damn pattern of rocks that he’d seen four times before.
Moving like this, out of rhythm and in unfamiliar hours, skating on the surface of an endless black stone sea, it changed the perception of time. There were no new spikes of memory around which an hour could congeal. No new sights, no new sounds, and no new conversations because the heat of the day and the cold of night tempered everyone into the same person; short responses, shrugging shoulders, faces set in the same tight-lipped frown that said, “I just want to get through it”. And that’s who everyone was, bundled, muddled balls of just-get-through-it.
Except for Obo, of course. Obo remained genial and solicitous.

Ayram’s fretful eye glancing north, looking for Hrks.
There was nowhere to hide in this desert. If they ever came, he would see them, and they would definitely see him, walking pillar that he was. 
No one could see the Hrks, but they could see Ayram’s worry. Their pace quickened, and they stayed moving until anyone spotted the first cusiloe fly crack out of the ground.
A ray of joy strafed Mandri’s heart when he saw the brown peaks of the Goree mountains. They came up all at once, a long, dark lumpy line waiting there on the horizon. Still no sign of the Hrks.
They pushed through the sun, and evening brought them to the mountain’s feet, for the Goree had no hills, it was flat land all the way up to their bases, with a dust of red-iron dirt filled in the recesses between the pebbles, and then covered them up completely by the time that reached red rock.
The mountains themselves were buttresses against the desert wind, and as such their mottled red faces looked they’d just been attacked by claws the size of a river. Deep, scoring cuts, sweep, like great, static Ergs.
Ayram led them south, and now that they were safe from flies, he led them long into the night. 
Mandri whispered to Purl, “What if the pass is north of here? How does he know which way to go? ”
“He remembers it,” said Purl, as if that were a perfectly reasonable thing to say.
But there was just no way that Ayram could have dead-reckoned it all the from Minting Rock. The featureless Tib would have made that impossible, and the arc of the sun was more of a guideline than a precise measure.
He should ask the man himself, but Mandri decided not to, and good thing too, because the next person who spoke drew Ayram’s ire.
It was Seb.
He had to poop.
Ayram shushed him, but Seb insisted.
“You’re the one that made me eat those flies!” Seb said.
“Alright!” Ayram exclaimed, and he stopped the train. “Just be quick and quiet.”
“It ain’t gonna be quiet, I can tell ya that. Matter of fact, ain’t gonna be quick, either.”
Seb sauntered off into the rocks, and disappeared amongst the shadows.
Mandri dumped Obo onto the ground, then went to Moto and asked for some twigs to make a fire to calm the night chill.
“No fires,” Ayram said.
“We’ve got to be quiet, and we’ve got to pass unseen.”
“Won’t the Mazydariga know where we are regardless?”
Moto answered, “It’s not that Hrks we’re worried about. See, there’s two kinds tribes in the Goree: those who want to kill you, and those who want to steal your stuff. Either way, you end up dead.”
“Well, if they’re up in the mountains, won’t they have seen us coming from miles away?”
“Probably not, actually. There’s not much reason for them to be watching the Tib, because it’s not a journey often made. We might have slipped through and if we have, don’t want to spoil it with a fire.”
“Tomorrow morning.”
“The light of day?”
“Yes.”
““But… you just said that everyone wants to kill us.”
“The Goree pass is neutral ground, so long as you pass in the day.”
“And who makes sure of that?” Obo asked.
“Custom.”
“Hah!”
Obo’s laugh drew a snarl from Moto. “Custom may mean nothing to you,” he said, “but desert customs have a bounded logic which demands respect. They have preserved us for thousands of years. Every tribesman knows that if they violate the Goree Pass, then .”
Obo said, with ebullient eyes, “I didn’t laugh because I doubted you. I laughed because I believed you.”
“Well, I don’t believe him,” Mandri said.
“But you should,” said Obo.
“I’ve met enough people to know that custom doesn’t stop people from looking out themselves when it comes down to it.”
“Have you ever heard of the Old Believers?” Obo asked.
“The who?”
“There was once a tribe called the Old Believers. They lived in an alluvial plain just south of . They had strange ways of worshiping Solraheen, so to incorporate them into world of Hrk we had to reform their religion. The plan was to do it piecemeal, over generations, so as not to cause a stir. Don’t start with the relgion itself, start with some of the customs to soften them up. The first thing we did is we told them to not write Solraheen with two L’s. And we told them to use an open thumb when they make the sign of the brothers.”
“So?”
“Guess what they did.”
“They didn’t want to do it.”
“They built warehouses out of resin-rich timber, locked themselves inside, and then burnt it all down. An entire tribe of ten-thousand people dead in one night. They killed themselves and their children over a single L and an open thumb.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“Oh, it happened… It happened. If you ever make it to Jeket’s library, you should look for a book on the histories of the Old Believers.”
“Yeah, I’m not going to do that.”
“I had never met a religious folk who’d been so truly possessed by belief. I’ve seen tribes tickled by it, sure, but not so possessed as to kill their own babes, kneeling in prayer as they did. The priests in Jeket only ever kneel to peek under a woman’s robe.”
Elrahet was sitting. “You’re the Mazyd that killed the Old Believers?”
“Are you not listening? They killed themselves.”
Elrahet grunted a , and Ayram said that was enough.

They sheltered for the night behind a jumble of boulders which sheltered them from the icy western wind. 

Ayram shared some stern words with Seb when he got back from his fecal excursion.

All save Ayram lay down to rest.

            <Text>The mystique of an old, old relic is in the person who made it. The object itself becomes cliche - almost part of the background. But the provenonce makes it magical. The hand that carved it, touched it. A hundred thousand years ago.

Lord of the four quarters of the earth.

A ruined fort topping a hillock near the center of a dried out lake. The loose sandy mounds are torn every winter by rain-floods… carrying with them the remains of all ages. Even the river that once made eridu habitable is now distant and out of sight.

Salt swell of the gulf just to the south. Extensive sea-marshes teeming with enough fish, flesh and fowl to support a thriving human population. Back until the desert sands of modern iraq’ province revert to a grassy and shrubby steppe supporting tribes of sheep and goat-herders who travel a migratory path to and from the sparkling lakes of what is today the grat an-nafud sand sea of saudi arabia. 

Reed huts by the water’s edge. Fields of wheat and barley, date palms, animals out to graze on the steppe. 

In southern mesopotamia, well inside the curve (out of the fertile crescent), hardly any rain falls for most of the year. Here the newcomers had only the rivers to water their crops, and do even that they had first to reshape the very land itself, with levees, dykes, ditches, reservoirs and canals.

Elsewhere, people lived lives of subsistence agriculture, finely attuned to their needs and desires, a lifestyle that would hardly change in its essentials until nearly our own times. 

But those who came to south mesopotamia came were not interested in doing as their ancestors had done, adapting their manner of living to fit into the natural world as they found it. Instead they were determined to adapt their environment to suit their way of life.

With the city came the centralized state, the hierarchy of social classes, the division of labour, organized religion, monumental building, civil engineering, writing, lit, sculpture, art, music education, math, law, wheeled vehicles, sailing boats, potter’s kiln, metallurgy, synthetic materials. Concept of Numbers, weight, etc.

Soviet assyriologists, - the birth of the most ancient class societies and the first centres of slave-owning civilization.

Currently, climate change, epochs of hotter and drier weeather alternating with wetter and cooler periods, prompted humans to adapt their way of living. 

All these explanations treat people as passive objects, recipients of outside influences, targets of the workings of eternal forces, compliant tools of outside agencies. 

The actual story would have to allow for the everlasting conflict between progressives and conservatives, between the forward and the backward looking, between those who propose ‘let’s do something new’, and those who think ‘the old ways are best’, ‘lets improve’ vs. ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’.  No great shift in culture ever took place without such a contest.

The neolithic revolution that took our ancestors from hunting and gathering in small kinship-based bands to a settled, communal village life of subsistence agriculture was the greatest ever mass-destroyer of skills, cultures and languages in human history. No band of hunter gatherers can have simply given up all they knew and settled down to sedentary farming without engaging in a giant battle of ideas.
To the author of Genesis, the neolithic revolution signified the fall of man: ‘Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread.’…colin tudge: ‘farming in neolithic times was obviously harsh: the first farming peoples were less robust than the hunter-gatherers who had preceded them, and suffered nutritional, traumatic and infectious disorders that their forebears had been spared.’ 

In this light it seems that the momentous change to agriculture as the basis of life can only have been driven by the spread of a powerful new ideology, necessarily in those days expressed in the form a new religion, propogated with, as Jacques Cauvin put it, ‘messianic self-confience’.


****As the archaeologists dug int John Taylor’s gigantic ruined fort, which they were now able to date to the twenty-first century BCe, they uncovered a much earlier and smaller building under one corner, dating from nearly 2,000 years before that. Beneath this they found yet another sixteen levels of habitation, going right back to the beginning of the fifth millennium BCE, when they finally reached a ‘dune of clean sand’ on which had first been erected ‘a primitive chapel’, a little over ten feet square,constructed of sun-dried brick, with a votive pedestal facing the entrance and a recessed niche, perhaps for a sculptured image.

Mesopotamia acted as a kind of experimental laboratory for civilization, testing, often to destruction, many kinds of religion, from early personifications of natural forces to full-blown temple priesthood and even monotheism;from state planning to neo-liberal privatization. Primitive democracy, consultative monarcy, ruthless tyranny, expansive imperialism. 


Sun dried brick demands constant maintenance if it is not to recycle itself back into the ground - it was lack of repair, not destruction, that crumbled most of the ancient cities of sumer into mounds of dust.  Shows the ideology of progress; the belief that it was both possible and desirable continually to improve on what had gone before, that the future could and should be better - and bigger- than the past. The divine power celebrated and honoured here was the epression, embodiment and personification of that idea: no less than the god or goddess of civilization.

City names were written with a sign denoting ‘god’, a sign for then ame of the god, and the sign for ‘place’: nippur was written God.Enlil.Place

The numinous inner will-to-form of the deep came to be seen as a gigantic ibex, teh antlers of which showed above the water as reeds.’ - capricorn, a horned goat above the water-line, a fish below it

Eridu was pictured as wearing a flounced woolen robe and horned crown of divinity, two streams of fish-filled water, the euphrates and the tigris, 

Genesis makes him the son of cain: and unto enoch [enki] was born irad [eridu]

Mesopotamians recognized enki as the god who brings civilization to humankind. It is he who gives rulers their intelligence and knowledge; he opens the doors of understanding; teaches humans how to construct canals and plan temples, putting their foundation pegs in exactly the right places; he brings forth abundance in the waters; not the ruler of the universe but the gods wise counsellor and elder brother; he is lord of the assembly; he is nudimmud, the shaper, the fashioner of images, the patron of artisans and craftsmen. It was he who divided the speech of mankind. 

The great goddess, she whose origins lie in the old stone age, threefold divinity of womanhood: virgin, mother, whore.
As mother - the nurturing cow, ‘the beautiful cow to whom the moon god in the form of a strong bull sent healing oils. Divine milk was the nourishment of royalty. The gate of the cattle pen. Porte of mesopotamia. 

At Unug, the great goddess was celebrated under the name Inanna. But here it was her harlotry, her aspect as whore, that was most emphasized. Cities were always, until modern times, greater consumers rather than producers of humanity. The people who thronged the narrow lanes between high walls, cheek by jowl with the poultry and livestock from which most human epidemics spread, did not live long. ‘One-third of all babies perished before their first birthday; half of all children died before five; on third of population under 15. Fewer than 10 per cent were over 55. 

In southern mesopotaia, slow-moving or stagnant waters of the marches, canals and ditches must have kept the prevalence of mosquito borne disease, malaria, and swamp-fever at a constant high. 

Sumerian cities were sometimes abandoned for years or decades, occasionally centuries before being reoccupied. 

Colossal death rate put huge reproductive pressure on both women and men. Libido, the urge for sex, was of paramount importance in maintaining the population. The powers of Inanna, who controlled the compulsion to copulate, whom in these more decorous days we describe as the goddess of love, was all that stood between surviavl and extinction. Make babies or disappear.

Uruk was a city of vibrant public life, where coracles and punts laden with produce bumped along canals that did service for main streets, as if in an antediluvian venice; where porters bearing giant loads on their backs elbowed their way through alleyways thronged with priests and bureaucrats, students, workers and slaves, where processions and celebrations vied for space with prostitutes and street gangs. Conduits and tanks built of waterproof kiln-baked bricks, green and shady public gardens. 

See: Mesopotamia, the invention of the city by gwendolyn leick. 

At times must have seemed like one gigantic building site, echoing with the banging and shouting of carpenters and scaffolders, of brick-makers and brick-layers, of plasterers and mosaic artists, and of masons skilled in working the stone importeted from teh far west. Driven by that passiosn for novelty, the compulsion to put hte old behind them, to renew and innovate, that was the special signature of mesopotamian city life.

Huge embedded pillars of the colonnade, 2 meters in diameter and built of sun-dried bricks internally reinforced with tightly bound bundles of reeds, protected from surface damge by backed clay cones, shaped like oversized golf tees and coloured red, white and black, hammered into the surface in tightly packed arrangements that mimicked the patterns on woven reed matting. 

Walls decorated with coloured stones set into plaster: new cast concrete, prepared by mixing powdered baked brick with gypsum plaster. 

The labour that went into the repeated reconstruction of these buildings was immense: many millions of work hours. 

See: warka mask - depiction of innana.

The lips have no need to part for us to hear what she has to say; their undulation, complemented by the ripple of the cheeks, speaks for itself.

Above it are fields and orchards, stalks of barley alternating with dat palms. Over these romas the sacred flock, fleecy sheep among bearded and wide-horned rams. Now comes a human procession: ten men shuffle forward, naked and shaven, each holding a basket, jug or pottery container heaped with the fruits of earth, tree and vine; priests, perhaps, or temple servants. At the sacred site, signalled by the looped reed-bundles of its ceremonial doorway. A welcoming female figure, the high preistess who represents the goddess, stands outside wearing an angle length robe, holding out her right hand in a thumbs up gesture of greeting or blessing. She receives a container of offerings from the hands of the leader of the naked men, behind whom once stood a figure whose image was broke away. All that remans is a bare foot, the fringed hem of a garmet and an elaborate tasselled belet held up by a formally clothed female retainer. 

We guess it is the priest-king. A bull’s head, a ram, a lion cub, and two women holding objects. Some maintain that the scene depcts the ruler of the city offering sacrifice to its founding goddess. Some that it represents a seasonal harvest festival. Others, a stage in the mystic marriage, the hieros gamos, in which two humans, high-priest and high-priestess, couple with each other publicly, in emulation of the great goddess and her spouse.

Such peopleare not known for their sense of humour and lightness of touch; they rarely break a smile.

Big difference is that god wanted to destroy humanity because they were being too loud, too much noise (too much sacrifice going on for enlil’s comfort) - in noah its because of wickedness

T the Sumerians, the Deluge was the boundary marker that separated the preliterate from the literate period, the age of folklore from the era of history. It was the gulf that lay between the time when all mesopotamia followed uruk’s cultural and ideological lead, and the following epoch when Sumer was a land of separate city-states, each pursuing its own destiny. —— PURsuE this idea of cataclysmic event altering the destiny of the region. — Stories of the Quake.



If history begins with writing, then the birth, rise and fall of ancient mesopotamia occupies a full half of all history.


Momentus changes around 3000 bc. Suddenly, or so it seems, contact between the many ceentres of civilization ceased. Trade routes, outposts, towns and villages went back to former ways, older dietary preferences, accounting abandond, writing forgotten.

Typical were the rampanrts, ten feet thick, topped with watchtowers and pierced by gates, doubled by a solid brick wall fifteen feet behind it. 

What begins as willing acceptance of a utopian ideology can all too often end in resistance and revolt. The tyranny that ensues is almost always unstable and increasing poverty is usually the result.

The 3-metre high city wall had been breache by a heavy bombardment of slingshot balls, the buildings set on fire and the inhabitants massacred. 

NAM GIS SITA - lord of the mace. A title which in later ages meant king.

Salination, bringing up mineral salts from the subsoil to the surface soil, which ruins lan, is a hazard of irrigation. Dealt with this by leaving fields fallow ever other year.

Mcguire Gibson , U o Chicago:
As a result of irrigation, the water table ina field approaching harvest lies about half a metre below the surface… wild plants tdraw moisture from the water table and gradually dry out the subsoil until winter… in the spring, since the field is not being irrigated, the plants continue to dry out the subsoil to a depth of two metres… since they are legumes, the plants also replenish the land with nitrogen, and retard the wind erosion of the topsoil. In the automn, when the field is once again to be cultivated, the dryness of the subsoil allows the irrigation water to leach salt from the surface and carry it below, where it is normally trapped and harmless.

‘A’ meant water, canal, flood, tears, semen, offspring or father; “e’ was house, temple or plot of land; ‘U’ was plant, vegetable, grass, food bread, pasture, load, sleep, strong, powerful, to nourish or support. These could then be joined together to make further words: ‘e’ (house), plus ‘an’ (sky or heaven), gave Eanna, House of Heaven, the great goddess’s temple; ‘lu’ (man), plus ‘gal’ (big), made ‘lugal’, big man, lord or king.

The black fields became white,
The broad plain was choked with salt.
For one year they ate grass;
For the second year they suffered the itch.
The third year came.
Their features were twisted by hunger,
On the verge of death.

Complex societies are delicate machines. 
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.For want of a shoe the horse was lost.For want of a horse the rider was lost.For want of a rider the message was lost.For want of a message the battle was lost.For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.And all for the want of a horseshoe nail. 

Civilazitions based on ideology are even more fragile than most. Once people stop believeing in the system, the end is near;

It took no more than a few centuries for the city-state, familiar from classical greece to, for warlords and kings to replace temple priests as dominant powers, for the relatively egalitarian society of religious rule to fragment into classes of rich and poor, weak and strong.

Every morning for several thousand years, farmers and herdsmen trailed out at first light from their town-houses along these pathst to their plots, and then returned as the day began to fade, leaving the surface of the soil where they walked flattened, hardened, and sunk below the level of the plain by a foot or two.

Daily exodus to the fields in the dawn light. Walking alongside farmers dressed in their linnen or wool sarongs, carrying their hoes, rake, clod-mallets, and ditch-spades over their shoulders, some leading panniered donkeys or dangling their legs over the sides of creaking ox-carts with four solid wooden wheels, each cleverly crafted from three sections - a simple slice of log would allow the soft outer sapwood to wear away too quickly.

Now you pass out through the high gateway that pierces the towering brick wall of your home city. Immediately beyond you find orchards and vegetable gardens, planted with apple trees and grapevines for fruit, as well as flax and sesame for fibre and oil, and a plentiful variety of vegetables and legumes , beans, chickpeas, cucumber, garlic, leeks, lentils, lettuce, mustard, onions, turnips, and watercress, plus diverse herbs and spices like corianer, cumin, mint, and juniper berries. Ducks and gees raised for eggs adn meat, eventually joined by chickens somehwat later. Here and there stand isolated groves, mostely date palms, important to the local diet, although you would also see poplar, willow tamarisk and dogwood, grown for timber, which is always in short supply. 
As you leave the city behind, you pass field upon field of grain, stretching away as far as your eyes can see on either  side of the trackway. More barley than wheat, because barley is more salt tolerant, and the land has never fully recovered from the salination of the previous era. A network of broad and navigable canals, narrower flumes, tight and muddy ditches, finger their way among the fields to water the crop that is the staff of sumerian life.

Household sewage had been piped directly into the watercourses through an elaborate disposal system of baked-clay piping, with each house having pipes draining both waste and storm water int oa sewer under the street outside. These were connected to form a city-wide wast disposal system with its outfall sloping parallel to the natural fallof the ground, the outlet being located well beyond the city walls.

Beer, with its weak alchohol content, was the safest to drink. Often drunk through straws from large containers - suggest it had particles and grit that were excluded by the straw. 

Legumes - beans, nitrogenate the soil. 

Human predators are a regular risk, coming down from the higlands. During harvest, you need armed men close by for protection. The danger of attack is greatest in the north. 

Lugal - chief, king, ‘big man’— ayram!

In the sumerian times, politics, and its extension, war, were perceived to be the business of the gods; men acted only on the gods behalf. Thus the Sumerian Hundred Years War was between Ningirsu of Lagash and the god Shara of Umma. Men fought and died and cities were destroyed, but the actual argument was between the gods. Was fought over a patch of land, called Gu-Edin, the edge of hte steppe. Grazing landn for animals was always in shorter supply and more contested than plots for raising crops. With the land immediate given over to the growing of grain, livestock had to be fed on the steppe beyond. But cattle and sheep, if contained within too small an area, quickly reduce it to uselessness. Cattle eat the green leaves of bushes and trees and also bark, while sheep nibble newly growing shoots and undergrowth. Once the natural herbage of the steppe has been destroyed by the flocks, the only use fr the land is to give it over to agriculture. Thus, two cities which may initially have been at a comfortable distance apart would find themselves in dispute, not over agri land, but for residual steppe used for grazing. Separation by 30 km led them to collision.

At the command of his god, the ensi [governor] ush of umma raided and devoured the gu-edin, the irrigated land, the field beloved of ningirsu, ripped out the boundary marker and entered the territory of lagash. Lagash responded by turning out to battle behind their leader, eannatum, who, by the word of the god enlil, hurled the great net upon them and heaped up their bodies in the plain… Stele of vultures.

Down into the open pit, with its mat-covered door and mat-lined walls, empty and unfurnished, there comes a procession of people, the members of the dead ruler’s court, soldiers, men servants and women, the later in all their finery of garmets and dead dresses of carnelian dn lapis lazuli, silver and gold, officers with the insignia of their rank, musicians with harps and lyres, and then, driven or backed down the slope, the chariots drawn by oxen or asses, the drivers, the grooms holding the heads of the draught animals, and all take up their allotted places at the bottom of the shaft, and finally, a guard of soldiers forms up at the entrance. There would seem to have ben some kind of service down there, at least it is certain that the musicians played up to the last, then they each drank a poison which they had brought with them or found prepared for them, and lay down and composed themselves for death.

The rites come first and the beliefs are later develope to eplain and sustain them - teleology, its called.

Bruce Dickson - theaters of cruelty: “state power united with supernatural authority can create extraordinarily powerful sacred or dviine kingdomes, they are obliged to practise acts of public mystification, of which the royal graves are eamples. The graves themselves are part of the effort made by urs rulers to establish the legitimacy of their governance by demonstrating their sacred, holy, and non-ordinary status. E.g. public punishment of william wallace, dragged naked behind a horse through the city of london to the market at smithfield, where he was hanged, cut own while still living, castrated, disembowelled, innards burned before his eyes before being decapitated - turn a commonplace offence - military resistance - into a crime of spiritual proportions: treason against a divinely appointed ruler.

The underworld is poor accommodation - nothing decent to eat: ‘the food of the netherworld is brackish’ says the death of ur-nammu - we would not be surprised to find lower orders of society happily exchanging that unwelcome outlook for a brighter future spent serving their betters in the realm of the gods.

Superintendent of the boatmen, cattle inspector, fisheries regulator, the ruler and his family had expropriated most of the best city land.

Those led by heroes of such greatness followed them neither out of fear, nor out of love, and certainly not out of confidence in the excellence and efficiency of their aministration, but in awe of their heroism and bedazzled by their splendour, craving to bath, if but for a few moments, in whatever beams of reflected glory might chance to fall their way.

It is hard to display detached insouciance and effortless superiority while brawling with a spear, a mace, or even a flint dagger. Bronze technology makes possible the sword, the close-quarter weapon par exellence, which raises man-to-man combat above the level of crude, inelegante and brutish rough-and-tumble.

Pride- like a horse swishing its tail on the highway

Monumetal shift - people not gods the principle subject of the mesopotamin story. Humanity was now in control. Became rulers of their own destiny. 

Enheduana - first named literary author in history. 

He stripped me of the rightful crown of the en-priestess.
He made me walk through the thron bushes of the mountains.
He gave me a knife and dagger, 
Saying ‘these are now the appropriate ornaments for you.’

Valuables, goods and materials from the entire wider region poured in. Docked at akkad’s quaysides and unloaded their treasures; foreing mariners speaking in strange accents thronged the streets near the harbours. Barges laden to the gunwales with grain from distant rain watered farms far beyoned the alluvial plain daily arrived inthe harbour, unshimppted their cargoes and were dismantled, the wood destined for recycling in expansive local building projects. 

The softer arts are essential for maintaining peace and order across their domains.

A group of magnificent buildings stood on the acropolis. Equipped with all the facilities; grain silos, religious cult platform, school, bathhouse, fortified admin office block, and areas of garden.

The excavators found that the foundations had been laid, the walls partially erected and rendered, when the workers downed tools and left. Several basalt boulders were situated to the south-east of the building near a partially built wll, abandoned several meters from its corner wall. These boulders were in various stages of preparation, some aldready worked into usable blocks, some with visible chisel marks but not yet a usuable shape, and some still unsowrked.


Refer to the Guti (people who conqured sargons empire) as ‘fanged snake of the mountains) people who are not considered part of the land. Because of them, ‘grass grew on the highways of hte land’

Most transactions were records of state - makes civ look beureaucratic, and state run - but most trade took place outside the state system and went unrecorded.

Nonetheless, the neo-sumerian state was centrally controlled. Like communisim, supported by totalitarian ideologies, used to explain and justify social and economic arrangements. Centralized economies that in theory took from each according to ability, and gave to each according to needs - though in UR III, some were always more equal than others. Cities were made up of various groups, which could be familial, ethnic, residential, or professional. An individual outside these groups did not have a means to participate in the social and political life of the town.
The state owned all the land and productive resources. Ever memberr of the populace was under obligation to serve the state for at least part of the year. Tax-and-redistribute policy- every province pay grain and livestock into a central resource - by some estimates amounting to nearly half their production.

An entire urban centre, puzrish-dagan, also knkown as drehem, about 11 km south of nippur, dedicated to the collection and distribution of taxed commodities. A score of animals delivered to or dispatched from there every day. A state sheep-run near lagash maintained more than 22,000 sheep, nearly 1,000 cows, and 1,500 oxen.
	‘Reminded of system of compulsory deliveries which operated, at different times and in various forms, in the former soviet bloc, especially in agriculture. Very much like in ur 3 babylonia, in communist poland the independent faremer was required to dilver to the state a portion of his produce, for which he was paid a nominal price. The remaineder he could theoretically sell freely, though not in a real free-market environment, since the state reserved the right of pre-emption, and since it regulated prices.
	But the sumerians went much further than even the communists ever dared, keeping account of each citizen’s obligations and rewards, for which the ur 3 bureaucrats used a sophisticated and remorseless, running balanced-account system. The lowest social layers, unskilled workers and slaves, were regarded simply as property of the state and seem to have had no duties other than to provide labour. It was very different for supervisors. No question of soviet-styel ‘we pretend to work and you pretend to pay us’. The performance of a work-unit foreman was carefully measure dand weighed in the balance. In one column were itemized all the debits: goods materials and labour, grain wool, leather, metals and numbers of works - provided to the foreman by the state. These were converted according to a set convention, into standard work-days. The sum total added together. In the second column appeared the credits, the unit’s production output: for example the quantity of flour ground in the case of millers, textiles woven in the case of a weaving team and so on. The number of worker-days equivalent to this amount was calculated, and for the time off to which workers were entitled - at the end of each accounting year, the difference between credits and debits was calculated and any surplus or deficit was carried over as the first entry for the following period.
	The conversions were so calculated as to make a surplus a very rare occurrence indeed. The expected daily output seems to have been well beyond the normal worker’s ability, and many, or most, supervisors ended up carrying over an increasingly large debt owing to the state. This might not have mattered if the system had been a mere accounting device, not to be take too seriously, but that was far from the case; the state could call in the debt at any time. 
	E.g. began with a deficit of 6,760 worker days and and ended it owing 7,420 worker days. Debt, when converted to shekels of silver, would have wiped out two years wages. The debt would fall upon heirs, who may have had no other way of dischargin it than the drastic recourse of selling themselves into slavery.
	To experience the vaguely soviet flavour of neo-sumerian life, join me at what has been called the industrial park of girsu, a major urban centre in the province of lagash, in the year 2042 bce, taking as our gide the analysis made by wolfgang heimpel of uocberkley,.
We are at the door fo the office of the kitchens, whence are dispensed the supplies which are apparently the entitlement of many, most, or even all citizens of the ur empire when engaged on state affairs. The quantities vary according to rank and station in life. As befits the well-organized arrangements of this institution, a resident auditor, an accounting scribe with both literacy and arithmetical skills, keeps a record of everything that enters or leaves the storehouse. He may well be assisted by a group of apprentices, for not only is their food accounted for, but some of the records are shoddily composed in a rather less than perfect hand, suggesting inexperience. 
Today is the 16th of harvest month; the auditor is itemizing the days’ disbursements to travellers on the road:
5 litres good beer, 5 liters beer, 10 litres bread to ur-ninsun, son of the king;
To lala’a brother of lugal-magure;
Et.
Both prince ur-ninsun and lala’a have large retinues to feed; kub-sin is perhaps accompanied by several porters, and naturally enough, the high-born the sumerian nomenklatura, are given ‘good beer’ rather than the ‘beer’ drunk by common folk. Others are provided with more standard rations:
2 litres beer, 2 litres bread, 2 shekels oil to sua-zi, en route for great linen;

A stream of other applicants passes as we wait at the kitchen office door. We meet lugal-ezen, keeper of the bird-house, a dovecote perhaps; severl amorite women, possible prisoners of war; and an umber of dog-handlers with their animals, then as now in the middle east, everyone moves to avoid them: dogs are unclean and their handlers are socially the lowest of the low. Large mastiff-like creatures; the food they consumed suggest they were nearly as heavy as the men who looked after them. Comings and going suggest that they accompanied caravans on the road.
The auditor notes deliveries of bread and meat to a number of other institutions in girsu. Food is supplied to shipbuilders constructing vessels for trade with oman, suggesting local access to the open sea via the tigris; to the workers of the woodshed, storage facility which houses supplies of building materials like bitumen, reed and straw; to the guards of the sheep-house and bull-house, stock fattening institutions that provide animals for offerings; to the guards and inmates of prisons.
Nest to the prison is a danna house, a government rest-house, one of seven in the province. Such hostelries, sited at about two hours walking distance apart along the greattrunk routs of southern mesopotamia.
Occupying several rooms is the large entourage of a senior royal functionary called zabar-dab, bronze-holdr. Several soldiers accompany him, perhaps security guard, as well as an armourer, an outrider,r a personal scribe, three cup-bearers and a cook. 

National currriculum for scribal training was introduced. Large stat-run academies. 

For a patrimonial stte to be stable over time, it is best ruled with consent, at least with consent from the largest minority, if not from the majority. Instinctive obedience must be the norm, otherwise to much evvert into suppressing disaffection.

The colective view of most societies is rather conservative: in the main people prefer to see the socail arrangements of their youth perpetuated into their old age; they prefer that things be done in the time-honoured way; they are suspicious of  novelty and resistant to change. Thus when radical action must be taken, for whatever reason, a great burden falls on the ruler, the father-figure, who has to vercome this social inertia nad persuade his subjects to follow his lead. In order that his will shall prevail, he needs to generate huge respect, preferably adulation, and if at all possible sheer awe, among his people.

Thus gives rise to the Cult of personality.
A hugely complicated, centrally planned, social and economic system can only be kept on the rails for as long as people believe in it. When lenin died, russian party officials recognized that demanding the populace believe in marxism ,dialectical materialism or any other such abstract concept, was a lost cause. What had actually engaged the publics loyalty was the leader’s personality. As trotsky said, ‘we asked ourselves wiht genuine alarm how those outside the party would receive the news - teh peasant, the red army ma. For in our government apparatus, the peasantbelievs above all in lenin.’  The cadres response was therefore to institute the cult of lenin.

Monumental architecture to feed cult of personality - ziggurat of ur.

In the early days , the inevitable difficulties, failures and, ‘internal contradictions’ of any elaborate social and econoic machine can be dismissed as teething problems. Later they are blamed on the failure of individuals or the enmity of mlign foreigners. But in the end, they lead irrevocably to a loss of faith and a loss of nerve. When that happens, it can happen quickly. 

It starts with taxes from outlying provinces stop coming in. Scribes stop dating tablets with official imperial year names.

William hallo, yale uni, growing linguistic evidence based chiefly on the recorded personal names of persons identified as amorites… shows that the new group spoke a variety of semitic ancestral to later hebrew, aramaic, and phoenician.’ What is more, as depicted in the bible, the details of the patriarchs’ tribal organization, naming conventions, family structure, custonms of inheritance and land tenure, genealogical schemes, and other vestiges of nomadic life ‘are too close to the more laconic evidence of the cuneiform records to be dismissed out of hand as late fabrications’.
The hebrew patriarchs of which the bible tells are very different from the utterly uncouth savages of the sumerian texts, as they travel the steppe with their ‘flocks and herds and tents’. (Abrahams camels are an anachronism; camels would not be domesticated for several centuries yet.) 
Why would Terah choose to leave sumer, where their ancestors had presumably arrived not so very long before,
The amorites would never leave, they would eventually merge into the general population so thoroughly that after a few decades it would be impossible to distinguish them from their predecessors. Their time would be said to be the veritable golden age of mesopotamian civilization. The babylonians.

Babylon. She derives her name from a greek version of an akkadian version o fsome earlier original designation. Akkadians rationalized ti by taking it to mean bab-ilu, the gate of god. Genesis claims it derives froma hebrew root, balal, meaning to mix up, referring to the confusion of tongues through babel’s tower.

She owes her location to its strong strategic position: close to the centre of the mesopotamian plain, near to where euphrates and tigris approach eachother most cloesly. 
 
She can blame her evil repute squarely on the bible. ‘By the rivers of babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we rembered zion’,, and of st. John’s vision, in the book of revelation, of the woman arrayed I purple and scarlet colour, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of her fornications. And upon her forehead was a name written, Mystery: babylon the Great, mother of harlots and abominations of the earth.’


Most nursery rhymes were not first sung by children, but are vestigial remains of once popular ballads and folksongs, of forgotten street cries and passion plays, of long outdated prayers and proverbs. 

People afraid to enter the ruins of babylon on account of serpents and scorpions.

Due to rising of water table, we have no direct archaeoligical or documentary knowledge of babylon city dating back to its earliest days. We are forced to rely on oblique hints and and incidental refeerences by others.

Vassals arriving with gifts, tribal sheikhs delivering tribute. An enormous entourage of slaves, servants, personal assistants, gentlemen, and ladies in waiting, the workforce that serviced the daily needs of the king and his several wives, would be pressing urgently through the narrow corridors of the royal private apartments, bearing baskets of clothes, trays of food, jugs of drink and boxes of documents. The admin blcok must have been a hive of activity, with its messengers, filing clerks, accountants and auditors, with its bustling secretaries, under-secrtaries, assistant under-secretaries, and deputy assistant under secretaries, with its foreign envoys hoping to establish or cement political alliances and its ambassadors recently returned home to be debriefed and receive instructions.

All this busy and productive life came to a very sudden end when mari was taken by hammurabi, amorite king of babylon. Once the babylonian garrison was in contrl and all resistance suppressed, the conqueror sent in an intelligence task-force to examin the files. Agents spent many weeks reading through well over 25k documents, sorting them by author subject and addressee, and placing each group in a separate container. Tablets with contents important to babylonian national security - were packed upn shipped off by donkey caravan to the capital down south. 
Some time later, perhaps after an attempted insurrection, hammurabi had the entire palace cleared of people and burned to the ground. Workment then demolished and levelled whatever walls were left standing after the fire. Mari’s tragedy was archaeology’s gain. The palace archive, its documents sorted basket by basket, baked by ari’s final fire into everlasting permanence, were buried under the rubble, until dug up in the 1930s by andre parrot. 
What is particularly striking, over and above the details of political machinations and ever-shifting alliances among the strongmen, warlords and mafia bosses who now dominated mesopotamia, is that in their letters, you actually hear them tal. They do not couch their correspondence in some formal mode of expression but shoot from the hip:
	This matter is not for discussion; yet I must say it now and vent my feelings. You are the great kings. Whe you requested of me two horses I had them conveyed to you. But as for you, you sent me just twenty pounds of tin. 
	Undoubtedly, you could not be honourable with me when you sent me this paltry amount of tin. By the god of my father, had you planned sending nothing at all, I might have gotten angry, and not insulted.
	Among us in qatna, the value of such horses is ten pounds of silver. But you sent me just twenty pounds o ftin! What would anyone hearing this say? He could not possibly deem us of equal might.
	
Despite all the shortcomings, from these letters we were able to penetrate zimri-lim’s personality. Subtle humor, not without vanity, pesetered his valets for specific cuts of garments and reacted with fury when feeling ignored. He was not without curiosity, for we have records of extensive visits beyond his kingdom. Large appetite for details of government, constantly soliciting answers to unsatisfied questions. Suffered the internal bickering and scandal-mongering of bureaucrats vying for his attention. Pious, god-fearing man, prompting his staff to proceed with religious ceremonies and requesting to be kept abbrest of the latest messages from the gods. 

In earlier sumerian-akkadian times, all communities had felt themselves to be joint members of the same family, all equally servants under the eyes of the gods. In such circumstances disputes could be settled by recourse to a collectively accepted value system where blood was thicker tha  water, and fair restitution more desirable than revenge. Now, however, when urban citizens commonly rubbed shoulders with nomads following a completely different way of life, ,when speakers of several west semitic amurru languages as well as others were thrown together with uncomprehending akkadians, confrontation must all too easily have spilled over into conflict. Vendettas and blood feuds must often have threatened the cohesion of the empire. Just as tody the sterner social system of the usa, with its abhorrence of collective provision of public services and commitment to the death penalty expresses its identity as a nation of immigrants and deportees from many countries and backgrounds, in contrast to the predilection for social market solidarity and justice tempered by mercy in continental ueurope, until very recental a far more ethnicallly homogenous realm, so too do the draconian babylonian laws (hammurabi), like the similar legal provisions of the hebrew bible, both reflect and attempt to limit the potential for discord and violence that always haunts a fragmented society. 

Loc 3175

Whether that be true or not, it can certainly be said that the loss of ethnic uniformity led, as it has so often done at different times and in different places, to the disappearance of social solidarity.  So gone, therefore, was the sumerian attraction to collectivism and central planning.  From now on came an era of privatization and outsourcing - there would be no such thing as society, just individual men and women and families, some wealthy, some poor, some weak, some powerful. Of course there remained the great temple and palace estates, but they shed most of their workforce, and with it their responsibility for those who serviced their needs, bureaucrats and craftspeople as well as ploughmen and stock-herders. Instead farmhands and artisans were hired and fired according to season, and independent entrepeneurs and ta-farmers were contracted to sustain the estates monetary and commercial affairs. 
	The result was a financial system recognisably related to our own, featuring banking, and investemnet, loans, mortgages, shares and bonds, trading companies and business partnerships. This was history’s first eperiment in mercantilist capitalism, with all its consequences negative as well as positive.
	The positive result was to make some people very rich. Financial district of Ur.
	Dumuzi-gamil. An educated, cautious and thrifty merchant, who preferred to keep his records in his own idosyncratic hand. He and a business partner, borrowed a little over an ounce of silver from the businessman shumi-abun. They invested the money in bakeries that supplied the temples and palaces of ur and larsa with grain and bread. Woolley recovered a receipt issued by king rim-sin of larsa, for a monthly supply of some 150 bushels of barley. The partners not only dealt wit hthe great and the good. They lent much smaller amounts ofver much shorter terms to farm-workers and fishermen who needed emergency loans to pay their taxes. In turn, shumi-abum, who had advanced the partners the silver, sold the debt on to another partnership, nur-ilishu and sin-ashared. There was, it seems, an active market for bonds and what we now call commercial paper in old babylon. Dumuzi-gamil’s files similarly listed sums credited and debts owing to other merchants both in his home city and elsewhere. 

However, among the downsides of this proto-liberal economic revolution were the encouragement of debt, an ever-widening gap between the haves and the have-nots, and the reduction of many to penury and worse. 

The privatized revenue agents and tax-farmers who preyed on the populace were relentless. Many o ftheir victims were forced to sell themselves or members of their family into slavery because they simply could not pay. In the end the debt mountain grew to such colossal dimensions that something had to be done. Radical solutions were implemented that would have a long resonance in the history of finance.
	Firstly the law prescribed that debt slavery be limited to three years only.  More dramatic yet, when the degree of general indebtedness grew so large as to threaten the financial or even political stability of the state, was the proclamation of general ‘debt forgiveness’ which when all loans were declared null and void. Such edicts, often accompanying an amnesty for prisoners of the state, were the norm on the accession of a new ruler. But also sometimes mid-reign, such as when king Rim-Sin, a decade or so before his fiefdom fell to hammurabi, suddenly declared all loans void, and in so doing completely wiped out dumuzi-gamil’s cosy partnership, as well as much other business activity in Ur. 
	Hebrews eventually incorporated this crude remission into their law.

Writing, as we do it today, with ink on papyrus, vellum, parchment or paper, depends for its readability on the contrast between the black or at least dark, ink against a white, or at least pale, background. Though good light helps, it is not indispensable. The marks of cuneiform writing on clay are three dimensional. There is no contrast between the sign and the substrate. To read or to write cuneiform demands excellent and steady illumination. 

Father, complaining about his son’s attitude to study:
	Never in all my life did I make you carry reeds to the canebrake. The reed rushes which the young and the little caryr, never in your life did you carry them. I never said to you, ‘follow my caravans’. I never sent you to work to plough my field. I never sent you to work to dig my field. I never sent you to work as a labourer. I never in my life said to you, ‘go , work and support me.’ Others like you support their parents by working.

The omen tables - catalogues of events and unusual occurrences that preceded them and were thought to predict or warn. Babylonians did not think, even as modern kabbalists do, that the world only exists from day to day by a miracle. Rather they noted that there was an underlying order and logic to the universe, which careful observation had the power to disclose. Today we call that science.

Astrology, quintessentially babylonian, is undoubtedly a science - a spurious one, maybe, one rejected by modern understanding of the universe, certainly. But that is merely the view of our time.  So too were the omens sought in the livers of sacrificial animals, in the fitures formed by pouring oil on water, in shapes seen in rising smoke, in the unusual configurations in the night sky, the patterns of storm clouds, the abnormal births of humans or animals.

‘A butcher, uddanu by name, reported as follows: a sow gave birth to a young having eight feet and two tails. I have preserved it in salt and kept it in the house.’

Two kinds of doctors, ashipu, who specialized in omens and exorcism, and the asu who made physical diagnoses and prescribed remedies. 
	— note that even from the earliest times, medical doctors and ‘psychologists’ were separated.

Most treatments were, necessarily, herbl and dietary - pills and potions, rectal and vaginal suppositories, skin patches and plasters.

Abnormal uterine bleeding. To treat this, ‘you char and grind date kernels, wrap them in a dtuft of wool and insert the result into her vagina.’

Near the centre of baghdeda, a sprawling village not far from mosul in the north of today’s iraq, surrounded by ugly concrete buildings from whose flat roofs television aerials and satellite dishes sprout like weeds, rises a tell of crumbled sun-dried brick some 8 meteres high. A flight of stone steps leads up its side to an ancient church dedicated to mart shmoni.
There is nnothing about the architecture of this church that particularly catches the eye: it is a squat, blank-walled building rendered in adobe, with a stumpy domed tower surmounted by a metal cross. But this unpretntious place of worship is a remarkably direct link with the very distant past, and offers a challenge to some easy assumptions about the history of the ancient world. 

Landscape and climate shape nations. Coastal peoples are not like steppdwellers, forest folk are not like mountaineers. Those who sweat under the burning sun of the south have little in common with those who shiver among the northern snows. 

From the hittites, the assyrians learned how to smelt iron and fashion it into weapons. From the hurrians they learned horsemanship and acquired a device that would change the face of battle - the fast, lightweight, bentwood chariot with spoked rather than solid wheels. 

Concerning the fine cloth that you sent me: you must make more like that and send it to me. Then I will send you a half pound o fsilver. Have one side of the cloth combed, but not shaved smooth: it should be close-textured. Compared to the textiles you sent me earlier, you must work in on e pound more of wool per piece of cloth, but htey must still be fine. The other side mus just be lightly combed. If it still looks fuzzy, it will have to be close shaved, like kutanu-cloth. As for the abarne-cloth which you sent me, do not send me that again. If you insist, then at least make it the way I used to wear it.

Great suffering does not make people gentler and kinder. 

Middle assyria is where misogyny really took root. Where the hijab first came into being. Prototypes for the ‘harem’.

When sent on business into the harm, the eunuch must, like everyone else, first apply for permission to the palace commander, who himself had to wait at the entrance to ensure the eunuch came out again. And when inside, he must be careful. A eunuch who overheard the women quarrelling was condemned to have one of his ears amputated and to be beaten with a hundred blows. When required to speak with one of the women, a eunuch might approach no closer than seven paces, if the conversation wen on longer than necessary, the eunuch was flogged and his clothes were taken from him. For a man to engage in conversation with a palace woman, with no third party present as chaperone, was a capital offence. If anyone, a courtier or another palace woman, witnessed such a breach, they were thrown into a hot oven. 

Extreme female seclusion.

In assyria, as in byzantium, lower-class women were strictly forbidden to cover themselves (ears chopped off); in islam there was to be no division between respectable and non-respectable females. In its own eyes the islamic demand for universal female reserve is seen not as restricton but as liberation.

Connection between gods and nature first slowly stretched, then broken altogether. Previously, gods were represented in human form, wearing the horned crown of divinity, and surrounded by their attributes. But now the gods were represented as distanced from the world, positioned like idols on pedestals, and finally not pictured at all, but replaced by symbols: a sun, a moon, the planet venus as a star. 

Transcendence rather than immanence of the divine. Nature came to be desacralized, deconsecrated. Since the gods were outside and above nature, humanity - according to mesopotamian belief created in the likeness of the gods, must be outside and above nature too. Rather than an integral part of the natural earth, the human race was now her superior and her ruler. But only for men. Women were part of the earth - producers of children and milk, menstreul cycles tied them to the moon. 

It is well known that orthodox jewish men pray every morning: ‘blessed art thou, o lord our god, king of the universe, who did not make me a woman.’

All sexual contact even with their own wives required them to ritually purify themselves as soon as possible. Women were a danger to men’s half-divine nature. The female sex would not begin to regain a measure of religions respect until christians came to believe in a god who was born naturally, as a human being, into the physical world out of the womb of an earthly woman.

This dislocation between the realm of the gods and the domain of nature had another consequence. If different gods were nolonger directly connected with aspects of the material universe, there was much less reason to imagine so many of them. If gods were now no longer thought of as embedded in nature and in particular sacred places, they were freed to become omnipresent. One might pray to ashur anywhere.  From faith in an omnipresent god to blief in a single ggod is not a long step. Since he was everywhere, people came to understand that, in some sense, local divinities were just different manifestations of the same ashur.
Assyrians tended to merge all the gods into a single figure for rhetorical effect.  

Simo parpola - assyrian prophecies: ‘all the diverse deities being conceived of as powers, aspects, qualiteis or attributes of ashur, who is often simply referred to as (the) god.’ 
That is not to say that the hebrews borrowed the notion of a single omnipotent and omnipresent god from assyrian preddecessors. Just that their new theology was far from an utterly revolutionary and unprecedented religious movement. 

Arameans migrated from the steppe and into assyria. 
Migrations - push and pull - pushed from homeland to  attractive destination. For arameans, it was climate change. Rainfall decreased by approx. 20 per cent.  ‘ The famin was so sever that people at one another’s flesh… aramean clans plundered the land, seized the roads, and conquered and took many fortified cities of assyria. Citizens o fassyria fled to the mountains… to save their lives. The arameans took their gold and silver and their property.


The moral that assyrian rulers took from the disaster was that their only safety lay in possessing incontestable military power. War was too important to be left to the romantic heroism of kings and generals. If traditional fighting methods could not even hold off a swarm of camel-riding sheep herders, ashur’s rulers would concentrate on designing and building a new kind of war-machine, one that no one could withstand. Moreover, the only sure way to stop people migrating into ashur was to take over their homelands and rule them with a rod of iron. Empire is a necessity not a luxury. If that caused them unpopularity, so be it. Let them hate, so long as they fear. - but when fear is overcome, hatred remains. 

Empires are so epensive. They’re like ponzi schemes: financial frauds in which previous investors are paid returns out of new investors deposits. The costs of holding imperial territory can only be underwritten by the loot and tribute extracted by constant new conquests; empires must continue to expand if they are not to collapse. 

3o-50000 men,. King menachem no dobut mounted to the top of the great ashlar masonry wall erected by his predecessor king omri around the citys acropolis the better to observe the assyrian battle-line which extended as far as 2.5 km across and nearly 200 metres deep. 
	He would have seen, in the centre of the formation, the main body of infantry, compact phalanxes of spearmen, their weapon points glittering in the sun, each arranged in ten files of twenty ranks. 

Assyrian spearmen were more mobile than their predecessors. Trather than sandals, they now wore the assyrain military invention that was one of the most influential and long lasting: the army boot. In theis case the boots were knee-high leather footwear, thick soled, hobnailed and with iron plates inserted to protect the shins, whish made it possible for the first time to fight on any terrain however rough or wet, mountain or marsh, and in any season, winter or summer. The first all-weather, all year army. 
	Behind the phalanxes of spearmen, ranged archers and slingers, many of them foreign auxiliaries, also divided into companies, shooting their projectiles over the heads of the infantry. Archers were now equipped with a new weapon, the composite bow, another assyrian innovation, constructed by glueing different materials together: wood, horn and sinew. Though suffering from damp weather than traditional bows mad of a single piece of wood, and demanding much greater strength to draw - and needing two men to string htem, they could be made far more powerful and deadly than previous all wooden weapon. 
	In the lead drove the shock-troops: ofrmations of chariots, mobile missile platforms, the ancient equivalent of tanks. These were nolonger drawn at a slow pace by assses, but by horses. Each chariot was powered by up to four horses and manned by a driver who,  sometimes rode one of the horses and controlled the others with a system of traces, leaving room on the platform for the bowman and two shield bearers to fight more freely. These men were also armed with spears, sowrds and axes, so that after the initial assault they could dismount and fight as heavy infantry while the charioteer returned his vehicle to saftey.
	Cavalry - these fighters, wieldign spears or bows, rode without bridles, without saddles or stirrups. Instead they sat on blankets anchored in place by breastband, girth and crupper, and they  controlled their mounts by pressure from their heels. Horses were now so important that they were imported from as far away as nubia. Nineveh put out 3,000 horses per month, of which about 60 per cent were destined for the chariot corps, 30 per cent fo r the cavalry and the rest put out to stud. 
	The army had become the point - in every sense- of the entire assyrian nation. Each adult male had a duty to serve. The three highest military ranks, commander in chief, commander of the left, and commander of the right, were also governors of provinces. Military officers were addressed in correspondence by their civi titles and there was little or no distinction between the roles.

Assyria grew by capturing and securing points of greatest strategic and economic importance, trade routs and entrepots, and bypassing places of lesser signficance as long as they offerred no threat to assyrian interest. Rather than a unifomr solid block of poessessions, it was more of an open web. 

Assyrian empire rested upon a firm ideology, which has remained a model for imperialists throughout history.
	There must be only one realm. Every assyrian territory, no matter whether directly connected with the home country or separated from it by client states, was regarded as an equal province of ‘the land’, as surely part of the national patrimony as ashur city itself. Previous empires had allowed their separate possessions to retain a sense of ethnic identity and had ruled through local elites co-opted into the impreial system; the slightest sign of weakness at the centre led to revolt and insurgency. 
	There must only be one people. All who lived in assyria were assyrians, no matter what language they spoke or what customs they followed. Hence the best known of what are taken to be penalties imposed on conquered states: the deportation of the population and its replacement by other residents from elsewhere in the empire. From the assyrian point of view this was no punishment. It was the assyrian melting-pot. The disappearance of the ten tribes of israel into the general assyrian population demonstrates how well the policy worked, even with people as fiercely dedicated to preserving their identity as the hebrews.
	There can only be one leader.assyrian emperors were, by contrast, the ultimate expression of their nation: assyria personified. The image of assyrian emperors as despots of the worst order, indulging in vile cruelty and depraved luxtury, was far from the truth. ‘To the assyrians, a king immersed in revelries and cruelties would have been an abomination’, their kingship was a sacred institution rooted in heaven, and their king was a model of human perfection seen as a prerequisite for man’s personal salvation.’ 
	There can only be one god. Ashur was omnipresent throughout the empire. He had just a single temple, the esharra. One realm, one people, one leader - ein reich, ein volk, ein fuhere. As the tet deomonstrates, all assyrians, whether foreign deportees, or of native ancestry like the qinnate sha ninua labiruti, the ‘old time families of nineveh’, were regarded as equals. I commissioned natives of assyria, masters of every craft, as overseers and commanders to teach them proper conduct and to rvere god and king.’
	Foreign names of high state officials. Girisapunu - must have been a phoenician, as was the famous ahiqar, ‘keeper of the king’s signet and councillor of all assyria’. Provincial and district governors gulusu, arbaya and adad-suri bore aramean names. So did hanunu, ‘commander of the eunuch’s guard’, salamanu, ‘commander of the queen mother’s guard’, etc. 
	Aramaic supplanted sumerian. The Alphabet replaces cuneiform. Utility creation by semitic peoples living in egypt. They didn’t know hierglyphs, so came up with a shorthand for use themselves. From this came all alphabets in use today. Letter ‘A’ is a horned ox-head has turned upside down. Aramaic - ordinary working people - cuneiform was the preserve of the educated and the elite; 



Babylon benefitted from the destruction of assyria.

Herodotus was way fucking wrong about babylon city’s dimensions - said 80km, we know it was just over 10.

Death and destruction, far from being the enemy of mankind, is the positive, create force behind all history. Without it ther can be no progress. And that chnge, progress, constant self-transcendence are the only true tasks of human existence. Yes, the end is coming. Yes, the land you know and love will be destroyed. But from the ashes will rise a new and dfferent world, one which will take the development of civilization on to its next stage.

Victorian men woke up to the idea that if they died, as sole breadwinner, their sisters/mothers would go poor overnight because few money-making oppportunities for women. The distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor started to become established. Deserving poor were former middle class people who, through no fault of their own, became poor.

-great painting - can only stay for one night. Casuals were not to help the poor - they were to reduce the cost of them, get them off the streets and encourage them to work. The conditions inside were specifically designed to be worse than the worse slums. But the poor hated and feared the workhouse so much, there were riots in the north.

Music excites the passions. The shadow of their hands are merged together on the erotic symbol of the lute.

It is estimated that between 1600 and 1700 no less than 5 million paintings were executed in small and large centers of painting, a figure that is even more surprising if you think of the distrust of holy images professed by Calvinism from the very beginning of its spread.  The wave of iconoclasm it set in motion was so powerful that it cut off the most classic destination of the most significant artistic production. Today, the large churches in Dutch towns still welcome the faithful with bare whitewashed plastered walls, with plain, stark spaces, where there is no indulgence in decoration. Inscriptions and coats of arms may sometimes grace the memorial tablets and sporadic images decorate the balustrades of the galleries, but everything else is strictly image less. 

In the second place, the Netherlands learned to relate to art is a different way from the other European countries. After the connection of art with courts, monasteries and religious associations had waned, new relations emerged. Increasingly wealthy and numerous—in Amsterdam alone, the population had grown from 60,000 inhabitants in 1600 to 135,000 in 1640—and in step with the European nobility, the urban upper class had discovered that paintings were a symbol of power, objects to be collected avidly. On the other hand, Holland was the Mecca of trade and consequently paintings could also become merchandise. Whereas a harsh environment and a landscape indented by wild and impassable mountains made Switzerland practically inaccessible. The level expanses of the Netherlands were crossed by a network of canals that had been dug to regulate the flow of water, but at the same time were extraordinarily effective means of transportation, faster and more practical than any way on land. Until then, trade had been based mainly on spices, textiles and tulip bulbs, but it gradually extended to paintings as well, and that is the reason why many Dutch paintings are not very large. The fact that they were easy to handle and were less bulky made it easier to place them on the market. In the last analysis, that also explains the dissemination on an international scale of seventeenth‐century Dutch works and—unlike, for example, fourteenth‐ and fifteenth‐century Italian works—their presence in almost every museum collection in the world. They were so successful commercially that, at least until the foundation of municipal museums, there were very few paintings from this period in their homeland. 


After years of struggle against Spanish domination, the northern provinces won their independence in 1609. The tremendous industrial and commercial activity that followed made the Netherlands one of the most powerful nations of the world. In the United Provinces most people lived in cities where economic prosperity was widespread and there existed both relatively high religious and social tolerance. The Dutch were exceptionally literate since reading was important in a Protestant society which maintained that the individual must pursue the Bible by himself. Books were published in great numbers and institutes for higher education. This economic and educational background was fundamental for the explosive cultural growth which was to follow. 


 Jan Vermeer and his fellow artists worked in an age when almost every facet of men's lives underwent drastic changes wrought by the war and the violent events accompanying it. Holland emerged from these upheavals as an aggressive, Protestant republic with a capitalistic economy and a bourgeois society. These cultural conditions produced a climate in which artists suddenly flourished like flowers in a hothouse. It was almost as if the war had brought together all the ingredients necessary for the spontaneous generation of an artistic flame. 


The rebellion that flared after the Counts of Egmont and Hoorn were executed in 1568 had actually started brewing more than a decade earlier. At that time Charles V, the Holy Roman Emperor, abdicated; he left Spain and the 17 provinces of the Low Countries to his son, Philip Il. The people of the Lowlands were accustomed enough to outside rule their land had been subjected to foreign intervention since the Middle Ages. They had no quarrel with Charles V, who in the first place was one of them, having been born in Ghent, and who had allowed them a high degree of autonomy in conducting their own affairs.
But Philip was a different sort of man. Morose, dictatorial, fanatically Catholic, the new King hated the north, and cared for nothing but Spain and his religion. In August 1559, he paid a brief visit to the Lowlands and coldly addressed the territory's notables, the members of the parliamentary States-General. He demanded of the Dutch a three-million-guilder tribute to Spain in addition to the taxes already being paid, suppression of all Protestant sects and submission to his half-sister Margaret, the Duchess of Parma, whom he had made regent of the Lowlands. Philip then bade a hostile farewell to the States-General and set sail for Spain, which he never left again.
The first effect of Philip's harsh policies, enforced by the Duchess of Parma, was to arouse the Lowlands' Protestants, already inflamed by the anti-Papist preaching of the Calvinists. A wave of religious rebellion swept the country. Crowds attacked Catholic churches with Reformation zeal, threw down statues, and burned and smashed everything connected with the hated priesthood. One English observer said of such a riot that it &quot;looked like hell where were above 1,000 torches brandying and syche a noise! as yf heven and erth had gone together, with fallyng of images and fallyng down of costly works.&quot; Before the month-long holocaust was over, vast treasures of medieval art had been destroyed.

The Spanish answer was brutal and ruthless. In 1567, Philip sent the Duke of Alva and 10,000 troops north to replace the Duchess of Parma, and the years of the &quot;Spanish Fury&quot; followed. Town after town in the Lowlands was besieged, taken and ravaged. Alva executed his mission with a zeal that made him, and by extension all Spaniards, hateful to every Dutchman. He established a court called the &quot;Council of Troubles&quot; to try Netherlanders for heresy and sedition (Dutchmen called it the &quot;Council of Blood&quot;), and it was this court of injustice that sent the Counts of Egmont and Hoorn to their deaths. By 1568 groups of 30, 40 and 50 people at a time were being condemned to die; their property was confiscated by the Crown. 

At this point the young nobility of the Lowlands began to take up arms against the oppressor. Later, the resistance to Spain became a democratic—or rather, a bourgeois-revolution; at first, however, it was led by princes and counts. The martyrs Egmont and Hoorn were among these, but the most prominent was Prince William of Orange. William's role is comparable to that played by George Washington 200 years later in the American Colonies: he was by every measure the father of the new republic. He quickly, became the center of resistance in the fight, its voice, its general. He found the money and the troops. William was only 26 when King Philip left for Spain, but was already widely known as a brilliant diplomat and a man of culture as well as a dashing ladies' man. He was heir to the rich possessions of the family of Nassau in Germany.
When Philip took over his followers took great pains to protest their continued loyalty to their overlord. Their fight, they stated repeatedly, was not against the Crown but against the tyranny and injustices perpetrated by the representatives of that Crown. (The Dutch national anthem stems from those days, and still contains a line in which William says, &quot;I have always honored the King of Spain.&quot;) However, Alva's harshness and the King' s refusal to compromise slowly pushed William toward an ever-more-extreme position. One is again reminded of the course of events leading to the American Revolution.
The first turning point in the war came in 1574, when the Spanish siege of Leiden was broken by Dutch seagoing guerrilla fighters called Sea Beggars. These were rough and ready mariners who banded into a semi military organization to bedevil the Spaniards wherever they could. Often they were more pirates than guerrillas, harassing peaceful shipping for their own benefit, and even occasionally raiding English coastal towns. William disapproved of their unsavory tactics and only reluctantly recognized them as part of his forces. They were, nevertheless, an effective weapon in the fight against Spain.
That the Sea Beggars were able to sail up to Leiden to lift the siege is a dramatic indication of the spirit in which the Dutch fought their rebellion. Leiden is not a port. Normally it is several miles from the sea. But in their dogged defense against the troops of the Duke of Alva, the people of Leiden had opened the dikes and flooded their land to hinder the foe, the Sea Beggars actually sailed in over the fields when they went to Leiden's rescue. Thousands of acres of farm land were spoiled by the flooding, but time and again during the war the Dutch made similar sacrifices such as burning their own crops to aid the fight against the hated Spaniard.
Five years after the successful defense of Leiden, eight of the northern provinces-Utrecht, Holland, Zeeland, Guelderland, Overijssel, Friesland, Groaning and Drenthe-signed a treaty called the Union of Utrecht. At the beginning of the war, each Dutch province had fought on its own under the loose control of William of Orange. Now these eight provinces were bound in a &quot;firm union&quot; for the common defense. Two years later they took the final step of rebellion: they abjured the King of Spain as their legal lord. The States General met in 1581 to draw up a document in justification of their moral right to act:



Those years also ushered in the Golden Age of art, with the first paintings from the easels of Frans Hals, Hercules Seghers and Hendrick Avercamp. In fact, so closely did the birth of the new school of painting coincide with the birth of the nation that a French art historian has remarked that it was as if &quot;the right to having a free and national school of painting had been part of the stipulations of the treaty of 1609.&quot;
This new school of painting was actually a branch of the Flemish art that in earlier centuries had produced such masters as the Van Eycks, Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Brueghel. But while Flemish masters such as Rubens and Van Dyke continued brilliantly into the seventeenth Century in the traditional vein of European art, the Dutch school moved on its own way toward an ever-more-searching realism, and established itself as a separate stream.
The evolution of these two schools of painting was clearly related to the political developments of the war. When the eight northern provinces formed their &quot;firm union,&quot; they created a permanent division within the Lowlands, drawing a boundary that has stayed much the same to the present day. The southern provinces that did not join the union comprising modern Belgium—were neither able nor particularly anxious to break their bonds with Catholic Spain. The social system in the south was still feudal, dominated by an aristocracy that was largely French-speaking and not nationally oriented. What Protestants there were in: the south fled north many of these were businessmen from Antwerp, and their loss debilitated the southern provinces as much as did the continued Spanish occupation there. It would be two centuries before Belgium emerged as a stable, independent nation.
The artists, now completely reliant on the private citizen's patronage, responded to his demands with an energy and genius that more than matched the vigor and imagination of the merchants themselves. The result was not only a vivid portrait of a nation and a time but a brilliant chapter in art history as well. From the pictorial record left by this artistic outburst, as well as tram accounts of contemporary writers, a clear image emerges of what life was like far the country's middle classes amidst all the fighting, trading and speculating. After 1600, there was very little left of the aristocratic way of life in the United Provinces. The new republican society had shun itself of its worldly and ecclesiastic princes. The House of Orange maintained a small court at The Hague which boasted a coterie of elegant, French-speaking, dueling gallants; but the general tenor of life was set by the merchants. There were few visible class distinctions among these men and their houses reflected their simple tastes. Ostentation went against the grain-because they were Protestants, because they had just emerged tram the austerity of the war and because their business ventures by their very nature were highly speculative—and a man's house, like the things in it, was an investment that he might have to dispose of at any moment. So the furniture of a middle-class house at the beginning of the century was not very different from what would have been found in the late Middle Ages: a few tables, cupboards, a linen closet, several alcove beds built into the walls, a desk. The mantelpiece might be decorated, and the walls of the best room might have wainscoting, but the rest of the rooms were whitewashed.

Silk satin was regarded as the hardest material to capture because it reflects the light. Ter Borch was the master at painting silk-satin. One of the problems was, inevitable they would move, and the reflections woudl change, and so they would use a mannekin, leaving the flods unchanged for days. 

It looks to us as though he’s a gentleman who’s just entered a music room. There’s a woman playing a lute, and a man looks on suspiciously. Why suspiciously? Well the dutch would have seen something, there’s a signal taking place between them. The hand gestures. She’s thrusting her thumb between two of her fingers, and he accepts by making a circle with his thumb and forefinger. Women would tease men.

Slouching towards utopia

Michael Ledeen 

Jonah Goldberg, Ledeen's colleague at National Review, coined the term &quot;Ledeen Doctrine&quot; in a 2002 column. This tongue-in-cheek &quot;doctrine&quot; is usually summarized as &quot;Every ten years or so, the United States needs to pick up some small crappy little country and throw it against the wall, just to show the world we mean business,&quot; which Goldberg remembered Ledeen saying in an early 1990s speech. </Text>

            <Text>Artist.
Mandrameen despised the word.
Who isn’t an artist?
A dancer, a poet, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a hole-digger? He can be an artist too if he digs holes in a way that’s true to himself. Give most men a shovel, a mound of dirt, time to think about it, and two seductive lumps are sure to spring out of the clay. How is that different than the triptych’d nudes of Allasoreen? Even a tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed. Mandri believed that all tax collectors are artists.
A true artist, though, that is a distinction worth noting, and it has almost nothing to do with what a person does, whether it be dancing, digging, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never do anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artistry—god-given talent—that is a state of mind. To be sure, its not a particularly noble one. It’s a mind characterized by comic excess; too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so large a sense self such that it becomes impossible to describe the true artist without resorting to sarcasm.
Mandrameen was such an artist.
When asked what he did for a living, he’d say that he “makes things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. but as a true artist, he is remembered in Hrkan circles for the way he’d strut around and make grand pronouncements about his own work. Hrkan circles coped with this by strutting around in kind, repeating Mandri’s words and following them up with something like a wink. 
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. 
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then flash a knowing smile. 
Mandri didn’t see a problem with this because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. Maybe they were the only safe targets, because it wasn’t really the person he was making fun of, it was the work itself. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes a special kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity.
Now, none of that is necessarily true, but the truth of it doesn’t matter. The point is that Mandri believed that skilled artists are all pricks, they say prickish things, and that he was a skilled artist, so, he was a just a prick himself, he was trying to be one.
He would to say to a young Hrkan prince, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” The prince’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Budding lordship be damned, Mandri’s knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if he wasn’t correct in the literal, figurative, or spiritual sense, well, the other person certainly wrong as well and needed to be told as much.
That is, perhaps, the best way to come to terms with Mandrameen, he was a young man who stared reality straight in the face and claimed, with all the certainty of a Solitant priest, that subjectivity does not exist, that he alone had access to a higher truth, because he alone had put in the hours necessary to realize it.
This miracle of denial seems like it shouldn’t be possible. Two people look at the same painting and walk away disagreeing about its worth. What are you gonna do? Ask Mandrameen about it, and he’d bob his narrow face, run his fingers through his flouncy black hair, sigh like the weight of he world was on his shoulders, and then he’d say that one of those people was wrong. Maybe both were idiots. He’d tell you who was what once he’d seen the painting for himself.
The stunning thing about all this is that most people agreed with him. Or rather, most deferred to his judgment. After all, Mandri had lived all his bright-eyed years being told he was Solraheen’s gift to humanity, and it wasn’t just his grandmother saying this, it was everyone. They said it because Mandrameen, at the age of ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
These were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brushstrokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait, he observed a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of color he could define the skin, the cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, and even the mood of the piece. A single stroke! He once painted a woman, and her cleavage, using only twelve—count them, twelve—strokes. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten, but those hardly counted. Nobody noticed them. It didn’t stop scribes from marveling at how he packed so much information into a few slaps of pigment. 
“These are the marks of genius,” they’d say.
Wink, wink.
But all shooting stars eventually fall. In Mandri’s case it wasn’t so much a ‘fall’ as it was a gradual decline. It might’ve been different, but in his own words, he refused debase himself by doing what it takes to succeed.
See, Mandri was a painter, and in such a craft there are limits. Once you achieve a certain degree of skill, everyone is more or less as good as everyone else, and outside of true genius, the only thing that separates professionals is how willing they are to ingratiate themselves with governors, princes, and priests. Success has little to do with quality, or skill. Maybe novelty plays a role, but mostly it’s about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It was about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. It was about manufacturing popularity any way that you can. Being the true artist that Mandri was, he refused to play this game. So, he walked away from the craft and dived headfirst into hallucinogenic drugs.
The very first time that Mandri picked some brown burgeons, crushed them up, and smoked their dried juices instead of using them for pigment, he came to a life-changing conclusion: Art was essentially pointless. 
Obviously pointless. 
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
That was an undeniable fact.
Mandri had traveled to every city on the holy continent, and he had seen every painting and every sculpture worth seeing and they all fell short of Solraheen’s creation. Naturally, this included his own work - first and foremost his own work. And the problem was always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see. When it comes to Nature, well, it’s complex. If artists were smart, they might be able to approach this complexity with, but artists are people, and people are dumb, so they boil that complexity down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible lump which has got them transfixed; In Mandri’s case that usually meant a nice pair of tits. A pretty face could suffice. Maybe it’d be a flower. What matters is that he’d try to rip the thing from the fabric of reality and stitch it’s hide to a frame, and then he would hold that up as if he really had captured and killed the thing that makes life worth living, and people would actually buy it. Some plucky merchant without a brain, who’d lived a life of comfort, would buy it and mount it on his wall. Mandri walk in to see it and be struck dumb by the feeling that the piece was better suited to the floor, next to the sprawling, headless hides of lizards. It belongs with the pretty colors because that’s all it is.
The commissions tore at him. Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d have to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf, its complexity, its pattern, its anatomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one - all that complexity, that beauty revealed to him by burgeonsight, was reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if you must paint the leaf, is to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. Maybe remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ bare shoulder. And then you’ve really done it, you’ve not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, you’ve erased it from existence entirely.
And it wasn’t just the leaf, it was the rock, the cloud, and the tree, and how it all fit together. Even the sand played a role. The true part of Nature’s beauty, the grandeur and complexity of it, was absent. Maybe one can say that Mandri wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture Nature essence, but that hardly matters. “Go and try and paint Nature,” Mandri would say to Meskalim’s frightened children during a burgeon binge. “Try reducing that infinitely nested beauty to a still image, to a brushstroke. Take as long as you like. Take twenty five years. Take a lifetime! Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…”
And then he’d forget what he was on about.
If he were sober, he would have said something about standing at the edge of the wilderness, a place with a big sky and maybe mountains. Smoke some valley burgeons to get in the mood, and then let the shock of Nature’s overwhelming beauty hit the spinal cord. If the mood is right, it will hit with an intensity that no poet or painter could ever hope to achieve. So, there was no point in trying.
Made his real living by giving portraiture lessons to wealth man Vigram Druamalun.
Vigram was an old, burly gentleman with a bald head and long belly-beard that he kept oiled and neatly trimmed. He lived in the countryside, near Meskalim, for he was rich enough to afford a private villa set away from the must and crust of the city, and he could afford to staff it with serving girls and a tiny private army—if twelve skinny men with knobbly spears could be called an army. Vigram called them an army. He made them wear a square tin brooch on their robes. This brooch bore Vigram’s own sigil that he’d dreamt up when he was coming up in the world. It was, in crude stencil, two hands cupping a pair of tits. It looked more to Mandri
Vigram was not an artist. Not even a true artist. He was a creditor. He’d tell his life story to Mandrameen during lunch, and he’ d tell it in a way so as to suggest that his success was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too.
First, inherit two ounces of silver. Then, scrounge up another two ounces—Vigram was never clear what ‘scrounging’ meant in practice, just get the two ounces, or more if you can. Then, loan those ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure its a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing to go belly up in lean times. Now, the temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, but get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and a pile of silver, and you’ve got yourself an ally.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s budding bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it’s got a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, its a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’re a human spider you can spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the continent. Really, it’s self-sustaining. People walk right into the debt. The wiggling only sticks them faster. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got your own little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed. As long as you keep the muscle separate, it’s all self-sustaining. And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours.
Vigram spent these hours by dabbling in the sacred art of the oil portrait.
His favored subject was his young daughter, Ora, who was Mandri’s age.
She was the only one of his five children willing to sit for her father, and on the present day, Vigram brought out Ora and said to Mandri, “Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?”
Mandrameen nodded politely and said yes, and his eyes flicked to Ora without intention, but Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions. The old man’s eyes squeezed out a smile and then he’d give Mandri his patriarchal nod of blessing. 
Ora was good natured, but she was a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen. She was easily twice Mandri’s size. Her face was fair enough, and she had clean brown skin and a sun-kissed smile, and yes, many men would leap at the chance to be with a fertility goddess, but Mandri didn’t want to have children.
Then Vigram set up an easel on a red-brick patio that abutted his villa’s western wall. Mandri had told Vigram at least four times before that this was a horrible place to paint. The patio was enclosed by a diamond trellis that was crawling with vines, and that meant dappled light, and dappled light was horrible for a beginner because the sun moves. It’s easily accounted for in clean light, but with the leafy shadows drifting across the face it’s horrible. Vigram thought he had an artist’s eye, and so he insisted on it. He shook his beard and said, “My dear Mandri, the patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
Mandri didn’t know what that meant, and he didn’t care to ask. He did what he was told and helped Ora up onto a high-legged chair, and Ora let her sausage fingers linger on his arm, and then Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his subject.
Again, Mandri did as told, and Vigram set himself to mapping out the canvas with a stick of charcoal.
When Mandri got around to see how Vigram was getting on, he had to stifle a burst of laughter, because Vigram was having a hell of a time fitting plump Ora into the frame.
That was Mandri’s fault, though, not Vigram’s (or Ora’s). Mandri had previously told Vigram to try and use the whole canvas, because Vigram had that beginner’s habit of not using their god-damned brain. figure small and in the center, leaving an awkward expanse of emptiness.
“I think you should first map out shoulders, and go from there. Put them a little lower, and go from there.”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm, then tried to readjust.
Once the , Vigram set the charcoal aside, picked up his palette which Mandri had already prepared, and set himself to painting.

There’s a old maxim that says that talented people don’t know how to teach. Mandri understood the reasoning; folks who don’t know think that talented people didn’t have to try to acquire their skills. So, they think Mandri never had to actually learn, and so how could he communicate the secrets of the craft when it all comes instinctively? 
But Mandri knew exactly what was wrong Vigram’s paintings. If there were any difficulties in the communication, it was Mandri knew that an average person can’t handle an unvarnished critique. So, teaching becomes an exercise in patience and pretending. Start off with a compliment.  
He nodded, and then said “It’s good.”
Then he crossed his arms and his eyes raced around the painting, pretending to take in the observations that Vigram , or rather, hiding in a blur of muddy color. 
Vigram had a habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes. Unless you really know what you’re doing, oils dry too slow for that. Mandri had this to Vigram, several times. “Get the color right on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the pallette is there for.” 
Time and time again, Vigram would mix a bluish shade of pink for Ora’s chin. It’s a color that only works for the chin a man who keeps a close shave. Vigram would slap it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes would dart between the girl and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips would curl into a frown and he’d mutter to himself, “That’s not quite right.” Then he’d stab his brush into a slug of red, rub it onto the manly chin, and of course, that wouldn’t be quite right either. This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
But the colors weren’t Vigram’s core problem. Colors could come later. Before that there was the issue of value—white, grey, and black. The man didn’t know how to handle light to move the eye around. But even before that, there was the simple act of drawing. One has to be able make a thing look like what you want it to look like.
Vigram looked like he needed a compliment. “No really,” said Mandri, “It’s good. I mean, it’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path. But do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to learn to draw hands,” said Vigram, smiling.
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. Ora’s fingers were chicken scratches. Mandri couldn’t help but smile. Ora smiled too, awkwardly, a distant third leg in the conversation. 
Mandri said to Vigram, “If you aren’t going take what I say to heart, then what’s the point of me coming here?”
“I’m sorry, Mandri, but hands are boring to paint. If a hand had one or two fingers it’d be a different matter entirely. As it is, they’re difficult things to draw.”
“Getting good is difficult.”
“Not for everyone,” Vigram spared him a wink.
“Vigram, if you truly want to get better, you have to fight against the urge to be lazy. You have to want to try, and in painting, what ‘trying’ means is putting in the time and effort to learn how to draw hands.”
“I know, I know.”
“Remember, when it comes to a portrait, the only things that matter are the face and the hands. You could give Ora forty ribs and a single breast, and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
“You say that, but I feel like next time I come over, you won’t have drawn a single hand.”
“Probably.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. There’s got to be an existential threat to get better, or else it will never happen.
“Mandri, if you did anything more than laze the days away on your ramshackle farm, you’d understand.”
Before the mood could get too testy, one of Vigram’s spearmen marched onto the patio.
He stomped his feet, like he’d seen hrkan soldiers do, and he said, “I’m sorry to interrupt, my lord.”
“What is it?” Vigram asked.
“The young master’s ox is eating the apples.”
The soldier pointed an accusing finger towards the field beyond the trellis, and all eyes turned to peer through the vines. There, some twenty meters away, was Mandri’s yellow ox, named Gil. Gil was was craning his head up high reach. The beast’s tongue was stuck out and twirling, trying to lick the apples off their stems. The present apple was just a little too high up, and his tongue ended up just batting the unripe fruit around.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” said Mandri, “He’s as much a human being as you or I.”
“Hah!”
“It’s true. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil and shouted, “Gil! Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. He stared back through the vines with that dumb, bovine ogle as the slobber dripped unheeded from his loose lower lip. 
“Gil!”
 Gil blinked. A second later he real Something clicked in his mind and he trotted over, dewflap flapping, skinny ribs rolling underneath his fur.
“Poor old creature,” Vigram muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said, and a ray of strafed his heart as Gil popped his head through a mat of vines. “Hey Gil,” said Mandri, “What do you think of Viddy’s painting?”
Mandri presented the painting to Gil with a flourish.
Gill looked at it.
He gave his grass a chew.
Then he mooed. 
“See!?” Mandri exclaimed.
Vigram looked like he’d been pricked in the bum by a ray of relief.
“Did you train him to do that?” he asked.
“Of course not. Like I said, Gil is as human as you or I.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“He he’s human, but he just doesn’t have hands. Maybe you should paint him.”
“I should!”
“But if he did have hands, do you know what he’d do?”
“He’d learn to how to draw hands.”
“That’s exactly what he’d do.”

Ora sauntered over. She put a hand on Gil’s snout and scratched him into a cooing moo.
“He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is.”
“Can’t believe you could pull him away from apples just by calling him.”
“It’s nothing. He knows his name.”
Vigram said to Ora, “What do you think of my painting? Doesn’t it look like you?”
Ora eyed the painting with some disdain. Questioning.
“It’s not that bad, is it?”
“Ehhhh…”
“Ora, I’ll your honest opinion.”
“Well… it looks like a person.”
“That’s progress!”
“A disturbed person.”
Vigram leaned back and studied the face he’d painted. 
“You do look disturbed, don’t you.”
“Maybe it’s just projection.”
“No, I just have trouble with painting eyes. I just don’t have the dexterity in my fingers for needlework.”
“Needlework?”
“That’s what painting feels like sometimes. Feels like needlework. Especially when I use this brush. I don’t have the dexterity for it.” Vigram held up a brush with thin, only a few horse-hairs wide. 
Ora turned to Mandri and asked, “Do you have dexterous hands, Mandri?” 
Mandri’s brows leapt up and 
The man was smiling like he was about to stamp a return on interest. 
Mandri said, “Uh…No, not anymore. I actually haven’t painted a portrait in more than two years.”
“Really?” Vigram interjected. “Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
It was common knowledge that Mandri’s farm couldn’t grow a weed.
“Ahhhhhh. Next time. Time for lunch.” 
Then Vigram set his pallette down on the wicker end table that held, and he took, leaving Mandri with ora alone.
“Why don’t you paint anymore?”
“Well, it would be hard to explain.”
“Try.”
“Paintings are boring.”
“Wouldn’t that be the artist’s fault?”
“No. Look. There’s not a…” Mandri tried to think of a more palatable excuse. “It’s expensive to paint. I mean look at all this pigment. The canvas. Takes a man a week to make. Your father can afford it. I can’t.”
“Come work for my dad. You’d barely have to do more than sing some papers every now and then.”
He’d stumbled into a trap.
“Ehhhh…”
“Don’t you think your dad’s business is a little… exploitative?”

“Are you dense?”
“No?”
“My dad doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for the lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t.”
“Is that how he feels about it?”
“Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. He’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”

“I promise, you’ll love it here.”
She set her hands on her hips and said, “The girls on the hill all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“Excuse me—what?”
“All the girls in Meskalim say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came by yesterday. She was looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“She couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
“You want me to bare myself?”
Ora crossed her arms and gave Mandri an expectant look.
Mandri recoiled . “I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
“That woman said she was looking for a eunuch painter named Mandrameen. I doubt there’s another painter named Mandrameen in Meskalim. Doubt there’s another in the whole world.”
“There might be.”
“Don’t those guilds in Jeket only train eunuchs?”
“I wasn’t part of any guild.”
“Then what’s your problem, Mandri?”
Mandri absorbed the shock of Oya’s bluntness by squishing up his face and pretended like he had no idea what she was talking about. But Oya was a girl who had no patience for  
“Ora…” Mandri had to play his here. He . “You’re a beautiful girl, but-”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No! No. Look, I’m not fit for a married life.”
“I could be good for you.”
“What do you get out of it?”
“You could be good for me.”
“You don’t really know me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
Had to bite down to hide his contempt.
“Yeap. Look…”
Building to a head.
“What is wrong with you?”
“See that’s what I’m talking about! This is what I’m talking about!”
“C’mon Gil.”
He’d made it to Vigram’s swing gate when he noticed Vigram running out to meet him. The old man had to keep his beard tucked under his arm lest it fly up and bother his face.


“What just happened?”
“Oh, it’s nothing.”
“You’ve got her in a dizz.”
“
“You almost left without your pay.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
“It’s my job to worry about on-time payment. Take it.”
“No, it’s fine.” Mandri didn’t know why he was refusing. 
“Mandri, I will get upset if you do not take this money.”
“Okay, fine. You win.”
“But - I want you to promise me you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“Burgeons?”
“Please, Mandri, I’m not a fool. I know you’ve been buying burgeons from Geem.”
“I haven’t.”
Vigram’s disbelieving eyes.
“I’m going to give you this money, but don’t go and use it to buy more burgeons. Buy some apples for old Gil here.”
“Okay.”
“You’ve got a gift, Mandri. I’m serious. Solraheen’s given you a gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later, Vig.”
Mandri smiled and 
“I’m serious!” Vigram said, “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, unless that gift was patience. His paintings were famous (regionally famous), for the economy of strokes, but what people didn’t know is that he would spend hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and repeat this for as long as it took. He mixed his paints with a few drops of sap to make the strokes dry quicker so this worked. So, in truth, Mandri’s only real talent, the only thing separating him from everyone else, was his tolerance of tedium. That’s the secret. Talent is just . Some people call that passion, and maybe that’s what it was, but all Mandri knew was that he no longer had it. 
When he and Gil got to the top of a hill that overlooked Vigram’s villa, he saw that Vigram was still standing in his drive, looking after him. Vigram waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons, Mandri!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
“They’re gonna fry your mind!”
Mandri wasn’t about to get into an argument at that kind of distance, so he waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons with the money Vigram had given him, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. Mandri was a little disappointed because the only stuff Geem had were south valley burgeons, decent stuff but the the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle, so the insides had a tendency to dry out too quick for Mandri’s liking. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. Then he and Gil continued along the road, stomping through the wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, until they made it out his dusty farm at nightfall. </Text>

Mandrameen despised the word.
Who isn’t an artist?
A dancer, a poet, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a hole-digger? He can be an artist too if he digs holes in a way that’s true to himself. Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and he’ll dig a sculpture that sings the song of his innermost world. Most men will dig a penis, as a joke, but that only sharpens the point, for if a man digging a big old ugly into a field is an artist then the word is as useless as an unmarked weight. A sheep-shearer is an artist. Even a tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed.
A true artist, though, that is a distinction with walls, and it has almost nothing to do with what a person does—whether it be dancing, digging, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never do anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artistry is a state of mind. To be sure, it’s not a noble one. It’s about comic excess; too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense self that it becomes impossible to describe the true artist without resorting to sarcasm.
For example: Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.
When asked what he did for a living, he’d say, “Nothing important. I make things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. Then he’d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and his charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then he’s flash a knowing smile. 
He’d say these things right to an artist’s face if he could get to it. He didn’t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. Maybe they were the only safe targets, because it’s not really the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are completely different things. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity.
Now, none of that is necessarily true, but the truth of it doesn’t matter. The point is that Mandri believed—in his bones if not his brain—that true artists are all pricks, that they say prickish things, and that he was a true artist.
He would to say to Vigram, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” Vigram’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Vigram’s wealth be damned, Mandri’s knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if he wasn’t correct in the literal, figurative, or spiritual sense, well, Vigram was certainly wrong as well. 
Old Vigram would argue the points but he’d end up deferring to young Mandri. Vigram himself was not an artist, not even the penis-in-the-field kind. He’d made his fortune as a creditor. Meanwhile Mandrameen, at the age of ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
And these were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait, he observed a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of color he could define the skin, the cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, and even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman’s portrait using just twenty-four strokes—count them, twenty-four—and it was a true, vivid likeness. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. Nobody noticed them. It didn’t stop Vigram from marveling at how young Mandri packed so much information into so few slips of the brush. 
In Vigram’s eyes they were the marks of genius, and he told Mandri as much. And often.
He paid Mandri for lessons. This was something of a charity, for Mandri was now twenty and inexplicably poor.
These lessons were given in Vigram’s countryside villa, a good ways away from the must and crust of Meskalim. The day started with breakfast, where Vigram, a burly old man with a bald head and brown belly-beard that he kept oiled, curled, and trimmed, would push Mandri to explain why he hadn’t achieved success. Each week he’d put the question in a different way, but it was always about that same basic thing: why wasn’t Mandri swimming in money?
Mandri would explain that financial success, when it comes to art, has little to do with skill or quality. Novelty plays a role, but mostly it’s about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It’s about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. Vigram always pushed back, and today Mandri settled the matter by declaring, in between mouthfuls of boiled cider pie, “I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.”
Vigram would then regale Mandri with the story of his own life, and he’d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too. Vigram had told the story so many times that Mandri could tell it right back.
First, inherit four ounces of silver.
Easy.
Then, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure its a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing the mob will put to the torch in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, because you are, but if you get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and a glint of silver, well, the bleary shine will blind him.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s budding bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it’s got a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, its a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’re a human spider you’ll be able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the holy continent. People will walk right into the debt. The wiggling only sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed, and as long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it’s all self-sustaining.
And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you want.
“No debasement necessary,” Mandri concluded before crunching into a piping hot slice of bread.
“That’s right,” said Vigram. “You see, you know about all about art, but I know all about money. And that’s why I respect you so much, Mandri, you keep them separate.”
Mandri wolfed down a peached chicken potsticker, then meekly agreed. He would have told Vigram what he really thought, but he really, really, needed the money.
Vigram clapped his hands and a nameless slave came in and took their empty plates, then the pair headed out to Vigram’s vine trellised, red-brick patio, where Vigram set himself to work in setting up an easel which he’d built himself. 
Mandri said, “Are you sure you want to do this here.”
“Why not?” asked Vigram. “Is there something wrong?”
“No. There’s nothing wrong, exactly. It’s that this light is going to make things so much more difficult.”
The patio’s trellis roof was not quite thick enough with vines, and that meant a richly dappled light would fall upon the sitter.
Vigram needed this explained.
Mandri said, “The sun moves, so these shadows will move…all these leafy shadows are going to be a whole other thing to worry about. It’s easier to learn one thing at a time. It’ll be easier if we keep to simple, clean light, that way there’s no shadows shapes drifting across the face when you’re trying to figure out which eye goes where.”
Vigram shook his head, and that sent his great brown beard wiggling as if it were alive. “My dear Mandri,” he said, “the patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
“I see. Well you can worry about ‘magical vestures’ when you’re good.”
“No,” said Vigram. “I won’t have it any other way. A magical vesture for a magical subject.”
As if bidden from the heavens by Vigram’s words, his daughter, Ora, joined them on the patio. She was Vigram’s favorite subject, Mandri’s age, the only one of the man’s five children willing to sit for him. 
“Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?” asked Vigram.
“Undoubtedly,” said Mandri.
Mandri’s eyes flicked to Ora without intention, but Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions. The old man’s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give his patriarchal blessing.
Mandri pretended he hadn’t noticed.
Ora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with a fertility goddess, but Mandri didn’t want to have children. But oh, her eyes. Impossible not to flirt with those sparkling umber eyes.
“Help her up,” Vigram commanded. “I’ll ready the canvas and palette.”
Mandri did as he was told and helped Ora up onto a high-legged stool. Ora let her fingers linger on his arm, and then Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.
Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.
Vigram picked up a stick of soft charcoal. He put down his first exploratory marks. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong too. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner’s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. He started drawing wherever his hand randomly landed and what happened next was up to Solraheen. The end result was that Ora’s head was, somehow, too small. It was also too left-of-center. There’d be an awkward expanse behind her flower-studded curls.
“Hold on,” said Mandri. “You’re moving too fast. Don’t think of this as a portrait—not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on the canvas. All you’re doing is putting an oval on the canvas.”
“Right.”
“So think about, where’s the best place to put that oval. Make use of the whole canvas.”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.
He stepped back.
He studied Ora.
He stepped again to the canvas.
Then he scratched a black oval right back where it had been.
“Is that better?” he asked without a hint of awareness.
“It needs to be a little bigger, I think.”
Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger. It was still a good ways off from where it needed to be.
Mandri encouraged the old man to continue, and from then on, almost every mark Vigram made was accompanied by a look back to Mandri for reassurance. 
“Don’t look at me, look at her.”
“Mandri, I need to know if it is right or if it is wrong.”
“Assume that it’s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it’s wrong, and then fix it.”
There was a glimmer of understanding in Vigram’s eye, but as soon as it came it faded. He twirled his beard in between his fat fingers, and then asked, “If the mark I make is always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I’ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.”
“You move on when you want to move on.”
“Then I want to move on. I’m here to paint, not draw.”
“Well, hold on. Finish…finish the basic shapes, at least.”
“Alright.”
Vigram ‘finished’ the ‘basic shapes’. He looked to Mandri for final approval.
“It’s your paint,” Mandri said with a shrug. “But you need to understand the importance of the drawing.”
“I do understand. You talk about it all the time. I just can’t do it.” Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.
Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first splotches of color in a flurry. The man was building was an affront to the senses, and Mandri couldn’t look away because he was getting paid to witness it. His world was forcibly narrowed to the canvas, which was hideous, Vigram, who was clueless, and Ora, who was eying Mandri up like he was her next meal. Mandri tried to avoid her at all costs, but he couldn’t help it; she was the sitter, the subject, and his eyes would have wander over her, and whenever they did, her smile would perk up. 
“Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.”
Vigram hid himself behind the canvas and gave Mandri another encouraging smile. This time his eyebrows jumped to emphasize the point.
Mandri said, “I’m not. I’m checking proportions.”
“If that’s what you’re doing, then tell me what you think.” 
Mandri took a pause to search for the right words to say. He knew what was wrong with the piece—he could write a treatise on it. He also knew that Vigram wouldn’t be able to handle an unvarnished critique. Almost no one can. If the man got upset, then there’d be no more money, and Mandri really, really needed the money. He was forced to compromise with himself and exercise restraint. He had to do what everyone else does: start off with a disarming compliment. Pick out something good to open the student up to critique. The problem, at present, was that there was literally nothing good there on cavas.
“It’s good,” said Mandri.
He sat back in his hip and made every honest effort to take in the observations that Vigram was putting down. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner’s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes—that can be done, but its very dangerous. Oils dry too slow to mess around. 
“Vigram…”
“I know, I know.”
“I’m gonna say it anyways. You need to get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the pallette is there for.” 
Vigram nodded, then began his work again in earnest. Mandri watched as the old man mixed a bluish shade of bronze for Ora’s chin. Unless there was some extraordinary circumstances of light and shadow—which there weren’t—it was a color meant for the chin a Jandri man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, “That’s not quite right.” He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, and he rubbed it into the manly chin.
That wasn’t quite right either. 
This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
“It’s not bad,” he said.
The charcoal lines looked like they were bleeding pus.
One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Ora’s left eye, and Vigram had an amusing go at it; it looked like a bandit’s eye-patch. 
“It’s good,” said Mandri. “No really, I mean it. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.”
“It’s on a path, that’s for sure.”
Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him fully into the work.
Mandri said, “Do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to learn to draw hands.”
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. He hadn’t even tried to draw Ora’s fingers. They were chicken scratches.
Mandri said, “If you aren’t going take what I say to heart, then what’s the point of me coming here?”
“I’m sorry, Mandri, but hands are too hard to paint. If a hand had one or two fingers it’d be a different matter entirely. As it is, they’re difficult things to draw.”
“Well, you can think of it as having three fingers. The middle two share a tendon so they tend to move together.”
“But then there’s the thumb.” Vigram sighed and shook his head. “The whole thing is just too much.”
“If you truly want to get better, you have to try, and trying means putting in the time and effort to learn how to draw hands.”
“I know.”
“The only things that matter are the face and the hands. You could give Ora forty ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
“You say that, but I feel like next time I come over you won’t have drawn a single hand.”
“Probably.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. If he didn’t need that money so damned bad, he’d have quit after the first session.
His little reverie was interrupted when one of Vigram’s men marched into the patio. He was a soldier with a puffed up chest, high strapped boots, a white plaited skirt, and a tall, knobbly spear—a poor imitation of a professional Hrkan soldier, though he did have the squarest chin that Mandri had ever seen.
The soldier stomped his foot and said, “Sorry to interrupt.”
“What is it?” Vigram asked.
“The young master’s ox is eating the apples.”
The soldier pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines, where some twenty meters away was Mandri’s only real possession: a skinny yellow ox named Gil. Gil was was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, but all it was doing was batting the ripened fruit around in circles.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said firmly. “He’s as much a human being as you or I.”
“Hah!”
“It’s true. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil and shouted, “Gil! Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. His protuberant eyes stared back through the vines, a dumb, bovine ogle. Slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. 
“Gil!”
Gil blinked.
Then he got distracted by the long, healthy grass brushing his belly. He bit off a mouthful and started to chew.
“Gil! Hup!”
A mastication later, and Gill was trotting towards the patio. The flap of his heavy dewflap rolled his short-hair hide back and forth over his sagging, aged spine.
“Poor old creature,” Vigram muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said.
Gill clopped into the patio as if it were his living room.
Ora slid off her chair and hurried behind Mandri and Vigram. Her intrepid hand brushed the back of Mandri’s arm.
Then the soldier lowered his spear and aimed it at Gil’s snout.
“Woah, woah, woah!” Mandri exclaimed as he pushed the spearhead away. “That is not necessary.”
Vigram nodded to the soldier and said, “Thank you, you’re dismissed.”
The soldier spun on his heel, and Mandri stared daggers into his back as he left.
“If he pricked Gil I’d have him up for attempted murder.”
Gill nuzzled up against Mandri’s shoulder.
Vigram eyed old Gil with disdain. “If Gil was eating my apples, I could have him up for thievery.”
“Ridiculous,” said Mandri. “Gil’s the nicest old ox you’ll ever meet. Watch this,” Mandri presented Vigram’s painting to Gil with a flourish, then asked his ox, “What do you think of Viggi’s painting?”
Gill looked at it.
He gave his grass a chew.
Then he mooed. 
“See!?” Mandri exclaimed.
“See what?” Vigram asked.
“He likes it.”
“No he doesn’t.”
Ora sauntered over to Gil and playfully scratched him into a cooing moo.
She said, “He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is.”
“Ora, what do you think of my painting?”
Ora eyed her father’s painting with suspicion. She stifled a smile.
“It’s not that bad, is it? Ora…It’s not that bad. Come now, I’ll have your honest opinion.”
Ora’s smile got bigger and bigger, and then she broke out in laughter when she realized exactly what Vigram had done to her.
“I look like a demon.”
“It’s not that grotesque.”
“It’s the hands,” said Ora. “They look like claws.”
The mention of hands put Vigram into full retreat. “I can’t paint hands!”
Ora laughed and prodded him on. “Why not?”
“Because I’m an old man! I don’t have the dexterity.”
“The dexterity?” Mandri asked.
“Painting hands is like doing needlework. Especially when I use this tiny brush. I don’t have the dexterity for it.” 
Mandri couldn’t help but smile at this newest excuse.
Then Ora said, with all the lust and must of a woman in heat, “Artists needs strong and dexterous hands, don’t they Mandri?” 
Mandri’s face lit up like she’d punched in the gut. This was the most upfront a girl had ever been, and right in front of her own father no less. Worse, Vigram was smiling like he was about to stamp a return on interest. 
Mandri said, “Uh…No…well, yes, but, uh… I don’t have any, uh, dexterity. I actually haven’t painted a portrait in more than two years.”
“Nonsense!” said Vigram. “I’ve seen you paint.”
“Demonstrations, sure, but that doesn’t really count.” 
“Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
Vigram rolled his eyes. “Look at you,” he said. “You’ve never farmed a day in your life.”
Before Mandri could answer, Vigram waved the matter out of the air with an open hand. “It’s time for lunch. I’ll come and get you two when it’s ready.”
With that, Vigram stomped his way into his villa’s anteroom, leaving Mandri alone with Ora and Gil.
It was a trap.
“Why don’t you paint anymore?” Ora asked.
Mandri made himself look busy by cleaning up Vigram’s mess. There was enough pigment left on the pallette for four more portraits.
“Uh…it would be too hard to explain.” He scraped a slap of yellow back into its clay vial.
“Try,” said Ora.
“Well, painting is, uh...”
Mandri tried to think of a palatable excuse, then he realized it was sitting right in his hands. “It’s too expensive. I mean, look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it’d take me months to afford all this. Your father makes this in a week.”
“You could make that much too if you came and worked for him.”
“I’m not good with money.”
“All you’d be doing is signing a scrap of paper every now and again.”
Ora picked up a dirty brush and twirled its horse-hair head through the muddy colors of the pallette.
She said, “You know, my dad doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for these lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t.”
“Is that how he feels about it?”
“Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. He’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”
“It’s a farm to me. And it’s a farm to Gil. Isn’t that right, Gil?”
Mandri’s attempt to bring Gil into the conversation was in vain, because Gil wasn’t even on the patio. He’d snuck out, and was on his way back up the hill to lick at that damned apple.
Purl twirled the paintbrush in between her fingers, feigning interest in its. She said, “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“What?”
“They say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“Couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
Mandri’s jaw dropped. 
“You want me to bare myself?”
Ora crossed her arms and gave Mandri a sly, expectant look.
Mandri said, “I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
“Why not?”
“You’re serious?”
“I’m a woman, Mandri. What’s your problem?”
Mandri was too thin to absorb blunt shock. He scrunched up his face and tried to pretend like he had no idea what was going on, but Ora was a girl trained in the art of bashful men. She saw right through it and made her move, grabbed Mandri’s arm and pulled him close to her. She caught his eyes and forced him to confront her lilac’d scent, her pounding heat, her smooth skin, her honeyed, aching lips.
“Ora…” 
Mandri knew he had to be very careful here.
“You’re a beautiful girl, but-”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No!—no.”
“I could be good for you,” she said.
“And what do you get out of it?”
She squeezed herself against him.
“You could be good for me,” she said. 
“You would not say that if you really knew me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
His eyes went wide at the sight of her mischievous smile, and the soft shadows of the vines just so happened to frame those sparkling umber eyes with the most magnificent golden light. A magical vesture indeed. 
Mandri nearly broke. He probably would have too, but Gil had finally reached his apple and let out a triumphant bellow. 
“MMMMRRRRUUUUUooooooooooOOOOOOOoooo!”
It was so loud and sickly that it startled Mandri and Ora out of their awkward embrace.
Mandri set Vigram’s palette down, and he backed up against the vines.
“Ora, this is not what I’m here for.”
“It’s what I’m here for,” said Ora.
Mandri looked for a means of escape. His eyes stumbled over a clear window pane. Vigram’s smiling face.
“Okay. I’m leaving.”
Mandri practically leaped off the patio.
Ora shouted after him, “What is wrong with you?”
Mandri did not answer. There was no point in answering. This was not what he was here for. He ran, then jogged, then walked, then stopped when he realized that he was forgetting something.
“Gil!”
But Gil was already trotting down villa’s gentle hill. Mandri waited up, and together they headed for villa’s swing gate.
Vigram was on their heels.
“What did you say to Ora?”
The old man was marching fast. His long beard was tucked under his arm to keep it from billowing up into his face.
“Nothing,” Mandri said. “I just walked away.”
“You walked away?”
“Look, Vigram, I don’t want to be a bother, but could I just get the money?”
Vigram frowned. He reached into his robe and pulled out a small brown sack of coin. He held it in the air like it was a treat for a dog.
He said, “Ora thinks you’re buying burgeons from Geem.”
“Burgeons?” asked Mandri.
“You deny it?”
“What would Ora know?”
“Do you deny it?”
“Of course I deny it.”
Vigram eyed Mandri like he was a theif. Then Vigram shook the bag of coin and said, “I want you to promise me that you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“I promise.”
Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, “I’m going to give you this money because I owe it. If I find out your using this for burgeons, then our arrangement here is finished. You won’t be coming back. And for Sol’s sake, buy some apples for old Gil here.”
“I will.”
Vigram put the coin in Mandri’s palm, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.
“You’ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. I’m serious. Solraheen’s given you a gift. It’s a sacred gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later, Viggi.”
Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. 
“I’m serious!” said Vigram. “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but few would be impressed if they watched him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he’d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. People only ever saw the finished product, those twenty-four strokes, and they assumed that Mandri’s brush went slip-slap-boom and there’s a true likeness. That story couldn’t be further from the truth. Mandri’s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and that’s a talent a person can lose; Mandri was living proof. 
When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram’s villa, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. The old man waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons, Mandri!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
Vigram shouted again. 
“They’ll douse your spark!”
Mandri wasn’t about to get into an argument at that kind of distance, so he waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle so they’d split too quick and insides would dry out before Mandri could get to them. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. 
Then Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the muddy wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back Mandri’s farm. </Text>

            <Title>Science vs. religion</Title>
            <Text>
	There’s a common train of thought in religious (and sometimes secular) circles that says there’s no need for conflict between religion and science because religion answers ‘why’ and science answers ‘how’. Unfortunately, this view makes religion completely irrelevant, because every ‘why’ question can be answered by ‘how’.
	“How?” You may ask? I’ll tell you how.
	On the surface, ‘how’ is mechanical, it is asking about method, whereas ‘why’ is more philosophical, it is asking about purpose. It seems conceivable, then, that two different methods probing two different questions might never overlap. And this works, as long as you assume that in Nature, method and purpose are divisible things. 
	But is it right to make that assumption? Is it not reasonable to suggest that ‘how’ depends upon ‘why’, and vice-versa? At the very least, shouldn’t ‘how’ should reveal something about the ‘why’?
	
To illustrate:
“Why was the novel written?”
Because the author wanted to tell a story.
“How was the novel written?”
The author pushed on the keys of a typewriter to form words on paper.

Here, the ‘how’ has a reference to the being of intentionality that forms the crux of the ‘why’ - that is to say, it mentions the author. Any answer to ‘how was the novel written’ would be incomplete without some direct reference to the author. And whats more, a truly complete answer will go into the research that the author did and how he came up with his ideas. From this you will learn ‘why’ he wrote the novel. (E.G. to answer how J.R.R. Tolkein wrote LOTR, you’d have to mention his quaint life in england, how this shaped his experiences of WWI, how he became a linguist, how he invented the elvish language, and so on).

I think a better division between science and religion is to say that religion makes claims to Truth, whereas science makes claims to the Most Reasonable Conclusion. Often these can be two separate things, because the Most Reasonable Conclusion is limited by the available evidence, and so it may not be pointing towards truth. It can be logically consistent to believe that something is True (God created the earth in 6 days), even if you admit that it is not the Most Reasonable Conclusion (Earth formed via gravitational forces over millions of years).

Anabaptists - martin luther’s reformation hadn’t gone far enough. Luther had settled for superficial changes to the church. Nothing less than a wholesale remaking. Read new testament. Saw that it described the church as a small select group of dedicated believers, surrounded by a hostile pagan world, passionately dedicated to christian living, sharing everything that they owned with eachother, rejoicing in persecution, filled with the power of the holy spirit which manifested itself in visions, prophecies, and miracles, and fired by the expectation of christs immanent return. The compared that vision with the church of their times, and they found it utterly unrecognizable.

Baptism had become corrupt - new testament should be undertaken only by adults as a profession of faith, never by infants or children.  How could you be part of a select few, if you did not choose to join? Baptism is a once in a lifetime event, as unrepeatable as birth itself. Anabaptist baptisms were essentially statements that the whole of christian society were unbaptised heathens.

            <Title>Just War</Title>
            <Text>Second Lateran COuncil of 1139, which ruled that there should be no molesting of certain categories of noncombatants, such as clerice, pilgrims, merchants, and peasants. Also: a flat prohibition against the us of ‘that murderous art of crossbowmen and archers’ in wars within the Christian world (These black arts continued to be permitted against infidel enemies.)

Medieval writers were fully aware that history and scripture were both replete with instances in which the wicked had vanquished the innocent on the field of battle. THis was explained in a variety of ways, such as by holding that God, acting in ways not fathomable by fallible humans, chose to allow evil-doers to prevail (presumably temporarily), possibly as a means of punishing evil acts committed on some prior occsion by the just side. But Power nd Right had no necessary connection whatsoever with one another. SO, just war was very different from a duel, in which two rivals agreed with one another in advance that the outcome of their combat would decide the issue between them and also preclude ny future quarrellingon the subject. Duelling was evil in that it converted a dispute of legal right into a mere contest of brute strength.

Victors must be just in their victory, must be scrupulously fair to his vanquished foe - must spurn temptation to extract unreasonable rewards for himself. No justification for plundering and robbing the unfortunate victims of defeat of all they possess.

Just-war writing always had  certain aura of artificiality, an intricacy and detail that appealed more naturally to the subtle debater or logician than to the battle-hardened general. Never, in short, has writing about war been so largely the province of people so far removed from the actual practice of the subject.

ON the whole, evidence of the impact of just-war thought on stat practice in the Middle AGes was decidedly modest. Realists will naturally find it especially difficult to believe that the principle of animus in particular was ever very much in evidence in medieval warfare. Even the principle of personae, in which the church might be thought to have taken a particular interest, was interpreted with an impressive degree of flexibility. E.G. Pope Jon X personally leading his forces to victory against Muslim armies in 915. IN 958, Pope John XII embarked on a decidedly un-holy military campaign against Capua and Benevento with a view to enlarging the papal domains. 

Law of Arms was in contrast a more practical law of warfare for the common soldier. Dealing with such matters as ransom arrangements for prisoners, taking and dividing of spoils, truces and safe-conducts and so forth. 

For the most part, medieval warfare presented a shocking picture of horror and brutality. There were relatively few pitched battles. A more typical method of warfare was the chevauche’e, whcih was a raiding expedition by mounted soldiers, dedicated to the destruction of crops, pillaging of property and general weakening of the enemy’s war-making capacity. Further scope for suffering by civilians was offered by the euphemistically named ‘free companies’ of soldiers, who hired themselves out to the highest bidder during war - commonly turning their hnds, with remarkable nimbleness, to free-lance plundering during times of peace or truce. These bodies were also known, with ominous accuracy, as les e’corcheurs ( scorchers). Nor did activities of free-ranging knights always measure up to the high standards o the medieval romances. Saint Peter Damian ( a bishop of Ostia in the eleventh century), for example, grumbled that the swords wielded by knights errant had created more widows and orphans than they had protected. By the end of the sixteenth century, knighthood had sunk to the leel of satire at the hands of miguel de cervantes.

Letter of reprisal - seize property of foreign national from whose countrymen stole something from you.
The wrong being remedied was not the original theft, but rather the subsequent denial of justice - a failure for which the foreign stat was responsible, and by extension, all of its members. The solace of these innocent sufferers, for what it was worth, was that they were entitled to be indemnified by the original wrongdoer, whom they could pursue in the courts of their own country. 
Period of grace before the seizures could begin. Another common limitation on reprisals ws the exemption of certain categories of persons or property from them. Church property was typically exempted. Also travellers, pilgrims, ambassadors, and the like, as well as merchants attending fairs. It was also common for foreign nationals who were permanent residents of the issuing state to be exempted. Scholars were frequently exempted too. 
Once the reprisal process was underway it was subject to continuing judicial oversight. Property that was seized had to be brought before officials, who would certify that it fell within the terms of the reprisal grant. 
Reprisal is a delegation to the letter holder of a portion of his ruler’s sovereign powers - i.e., the ruler’s right to determine the distribution of property amongst persons located in the territory over which his sovereign powers extended.
Letters of Mark - like letter of reprisal but for the the frontier ‘Mark’.
Catholic Church, most notably, was against letters of reprisal as oppressive and contrary to the laws and natural equity.

Hugo Grotius, in his famous treatise ON the Law of War and Peace, publishind in 1625. Law of nations in careful contrast to the older law of nature, which had dominated international legal thought throughout the Middle Ages. Two outstanding features that distinguished it - first that it focussed on the rights and duties of stats as such, and applicable only to them. Second, concentrate on the external actions of states and thereby to forgo considerations of good faith and mental attitude and the like.
This was the emancipation of statecraft in general, including international law, from the principles of interpersonal morality. 
THe pioneering figure was Machiavelli, whose name became a byword for depravity amongst moralists. He was the first to stress, in the most straightforward terms, the view that the qualities that made for successful stewardship of a state were not (to put it mildly) the same as those for gaining entrance to the kingdom of Heaven. Statecraft was increasingly becoming a science in this period, with the central concern being the dispassionate identification of the corporate interest of the state as such - followed by the rational and single minded devotion to the promotion of that interest. 
Doctrines and methods derived not from broad principles of morality but from a coldly unsentimental analysis of human political life as it was actually lived. Buttom up instead of the ‘top down’ character of natural law. 
Law of Nations vs Law of Nature co-existed and interwove into what we now call natural law.


Emmerich de Vattel, practising diplomat as well as a treatise writer. The Law of Nations, 1758, treatment of international law in its dualistic form. A great deal mor stress on the law of nations - or ‘voluntary’ law as he termed it. 

The world ‘soldier’ derives from the Latin ‘solidus’, a roman gold coin, indicating the tie between military service and the payment of a wage.

THis shift to the law of nations from law of nature issued a shift in professionalism in warfare, including a shift towards standing armies. These standing armies encouraged moderation in many ways in warfare. Uniforms to distinguish combatants from ambient populace. So expensive that rulers were loath to take undue risks with them. Generals often avoided pitched battles where possible because of the risk of the destruction of their forces at a fell swoop. As an alternative, war of manoeuvre became the standard strategy, with thegoal being to place one’s troops in enemy territory, so as to compel the enemy to bear the brunt of supporting them. Also moderating: comparative uniformity of military strength amongst the major European powers; only modest scope for territorial gains or losses.

Hamilton: “formerly, an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighbouring country almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received… The history of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned; but of towns taken adn retain; of battles that decide nothing, of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort and little acquisition.




This was the Age of Calculation more than the Age of Reason. With the goal being the maximisation of the national interest. THe ethos of the period was therefore relentless utilitarian, with little place for sentiment, moralism, or ideology. ALliances were formed and dissolved in a kind of perpetual stately waltz, danced to the lilting strains of the Eurpoean balance of power. Exemplifying the new style of rulership, near to the point of caricature, was that veritable crown prince of eighteenth-centry political rationalists, the ustrian Count Kaunitz-Rittberg. He boasted of his mastery of the arcan art of ‘political algebra’ which enabled him, with the unerring certainty of the mathematician, to thread his way through the intricate diplomatic mazes of the time. War took on the aura of a chess game, particularly in the northwestern part of Europe, with its flat terrain, network of canals, dense clustering of rich cities and chains of fortressess. 
It was a depressingly materialistic time, with no ideological divides, no great causes, no spirit of heroic self-sacrifice. In the practice of states, if not the ruminations of scholars, the just-war ethos was very little in evidence. Cynical statesmen had little trouble conjuring up a cause for war whenever one was needed.

Voltaire:

	A genealogist proves to a prince that he is the direct descendant of a count whose relatives had mde  family pact three or for hundred years ago with a house whose very nme has left no memory. THis house had remote pretensions to a province whose last owner had just died of apoplexy. The prince and his council conclude without difficulty that the province belongs to him by divine right. THis province, which is some hundreds of leagues distant, protests in vain that it does not know him, that it has no wish to be governed by him, that one must at least have a people’s consent before legislateing for it. These discourses do not even reach the ears of the prince whose rights are incontestable. He immediately finds a great number of men who have nothing to do nor to lose. He dresses them in heavy blue cloth at 110 sous the ell, puts a heavy white cord round their hats, makes them turn left and right, and marches to glory.

According to Vattle, actual state practice was scarcely less absurd than this. He maintained that the war between france and the netherlands in 1672 resulted from the irritation of the French King, Louis XIV, over the issuing of certain medals and the spreading of offensive jokes.

Hobbes - frank acceptance of the ways of power politics. Rejected natural law principle that peace is the normal condition of interstate relations. There is only the single quest for security in a brutally hostile world.

Vs.

Contractual viewpoint - war as a duel between states, entered into by mutual consent, thereby justifying the alternate label of the ‘duelling’ view of war. 

The comes the first forays of Total War in the napoleonic era.

_____It seems like law si the ‘narrative making mechanism of the nation’ in the way the we are the story we tell ourselves.

Grotius - a decision to resort to war is just if it consist in the execution of a right, nand unjust if it consists in the execution of an injury. - father of international law

Law of nations - legal relationships between nation states was of a particular character, qualitatively different from those governing interpersonal contacts. Previously, law applicable to humn relations, the jus gentium (or ‘law of peoples’) had been seen as merely a sub-category of the general, all-encomapassing law of nature.

The source of this new body of law lay in the conscious will of the states themselves. Instead of being handed down from above, it welled up from below, blossoming out of the practices of the countries of the world.


Vitoria - “Invincible error” of “Invincible Ignorance”: a state of affairs in which it ws not possible, even with the best efforts, to discover where justice actually lay in the case at hand. Strictly speaking, it was still the case that one party would have a justa causa while the other would not. But the war would nonetheless be just on both sides in the limited sense that both sides were free of blame. 
	Note: perhaps primarily this concept was applied to peoples would could not possibly have heard the word of God and so lived in a state of invincible ignorance

Grotious applied law of nations to situations where war between states was one of invincible doubt. Voluntary law would look not to the substantive justice of the legal claims but instead to a definite formality in the conduct of war. “ If the enemy observes all the rules of formal warfare, we are not to b e heard in complaint of him as a violator of the law of nations; he has the same right as we to assert a just cause; and our entire hope lies in victory or a friendly settlement.”

NOTE: vvvvvv this is ubermensh mindset_____
Under Natural law, no one is liable for the deeds of another person. Such vicarious liability was  feature exclusively of hte voluntary law. War entails the killing of persons not on the basis of any personal wrongdoing but merely because of their membership of the enemy armed force. The core defining feature of war as opposed to other conflict is that it consists of this secondary, rather than primary action. TThe effect was to open the way for treating war in a more flexible manner than before, as a man-made institution whose rules could be crafted - and recrafted as necessary - by human beings to serve their own purposes. The law of war was transplanted from heaven to earth. This is in contrast to medieval war, in which all enemies were considered to be wrongdoers in their own right, in the sense that all of them were held to have made a conscious choice to associate themselves with their leader’s cause. Grotious discarded this notion of universal personal responsibility. A mere ‘obstinate devotion to one’s party’, in Grotius’s view, was not in itself cause for punishment.
Grotius distinguished state of war on one hand, and ‘its actos’ on the other. A state of war can exist even in the absence of any acts of war on the part of either side. Contrary to medieval doctrine, which had seen war in terms of individual coercive acts or operations occurring within a state of peace that was permanently in force. 

--_-__In the utility of abstraction, we lose something of the concrete nature of reality. Abstract conceptions of States and Corporations etc. and the laws and regulations built up around them have no NATURAL right to exist, and their excesses and ills need to be guarded against, because they are entirely fabricated.


In the course of its development, muslim jurisprudence came to distinguish between three different levels of officially administered violence. First is fully fledged foreign war, which was known as Akham al-Hiraba. Second was war against internal insurgents - i.e., within the Muslim community - known as Akham al-Bughat. At the lowest level was state violence or coercion in the form of routine law enforcement, known as Akham al-Tariq. 


_Absense of belief that the natural condition of international affairs was one of peace. It held the opposite view: that, between the community of the faithful and the infidel world, there was inevitable and perpetual enmity, comparable to teh never-ending natural condition of war between the greek and barbarian worlds. The infidel world was even known as the Dar al-Harb, meaning ‘house of war’ in araic, in contrast to the muslim world or Dar al-Islam (‘house of Islam’), which was the abode of peace and harmony.


No specific wrong-doing was required on the part o the infidels to justify war against them. 

Infidels were allowed to retain their own religions provided that they refrained from disturbing the peace of the community and that they submitted to certain civil disabilities such as liability for extra taxation.


The idea of endemic warfare between the muslim and infidel worlds naturally made it virtually impossible to devise any body of rules for determining when a transition from peace to war was justified. A lack of moral community between muslims and infidels hindered this progress.

Two characteristics in particular distnguished the two types of miscreant. First, bughat(zealot) were animated by a doctrine or belief of some kind and not merely by greed for plunder. THe doctrine held might be misguided or heretical, but the important point was that the bughat fought as a patriot for a cause. The second was that a bughat group was the possession of some kind of internal organisational struccture of  a governmental or qusi-governmental nature. Maybe the form of a disciplined fighting arm comparable to a regular military force, or the effective possession of a territory in which the insurgents exercised de facto sovereign powers such as taxation or handing down judicial decisions.

Conversely christians believed that the ‘natural’ state of the world is one of peace, with war as an exceptional and perverse state of affairs requiring some kind of explicit justification. THe entire world was the ‘house of peace’ with no such thing as a ‘house of war’.

The most immediate practical question was one of personal ethics: whether individual Christians could, or should, perform military service. The predominant view of the early CHurch fathers, most notably of Tertullian, was that they should not, on the authority of the gospel teachings. Gradually this position was modified as a result of several factors. ON was an increasing tendency of Christian writers to see the Roman Empire as a divinely approved political vehicle for the furthering of the Christian fatihe and the safeguarding of civilisation i general. Even the most devout Christians could appreciate the value ofa vigilant and disciplined military force against enemies of the faith...Consequently, Christian writers began to stress the virtues of defending the broader community, and the faith itself, against external foes. IT becamecommon for them to lavish praise onto the ROman state nd military as a model (or at least a potential model) of disciplined and devoted community service. Saint ambrose of Milan, writing in the late fourth century, lauded ‘the virtue which leads people to protect their country form barbarians in time of war, or which in peacetime makes them defend the weak or protect their friends from robbers’. Even Tertullian, the most pacifistically inclined of the Church fathers, stressed that Christians prayed dutifully for the ROman emperors and their armiers. In much the same vein, Christian writers also began to stress the positive values of the law-enforcement activities of magistrates against internal wrongdoers. No less an authority than Sait Paul praised magistrates as Go’s agents, labouring on behalf of the community at large - agents whose tasks naturally included the distasteful, bu tnecessary, chore of punishing wrongdoers… THese tendencies were summed up by Augistine of Hippo. He explained that the gospel exhortation to pacifism should be understood as a limitation only n the purposes for which force could be used. In particular, the gospels forbade only the use of force for egoistical ends. THe position was very different, however, when force was employed altruistically, to protect others - i.e. to safeguard the community of faithful from its oppressors and enemies. That was a praiseworthy public service… Good men, he contended, could wage war for the purpose of ‘bringing under the yoke the unbridled lusts of men’ and for rooting out of vice.
Aquinas- There was no sin, he insisted, following Augustine, in resorting to force when ‘comissioned by another’ for the common good.


HERE we see who christianity goes from being radical pacificst - the door is opened by state power combined with the notion of helping others who are being struck down by violence, if not themselves. “IF you are struck, present your side. But if another is struck, you have license to kill.”

Women, children, the aged, infirm are excluded from the dictates of nature. Ecclesiastics, whose professional calling was held to be incompatible with the shedding of blood. (Clerics were forbidden to practise surgery)

The war must have  well-defined objective ; e.g. title of territory. - No such thing as endemic conflict (no such thing as house of pease vs. house of war)

Augustine - just war was, “one that avenges wrongs, when a nation or state has to be punished for refusing to make amends for the wrongs inflicted by its subjects or to restore what it has 
seized unjustly’.

Final criterion of just war - animus - war must be waged not out of hatred but out of love, for the purpose of correcting evil and briniging the enemy to the path of righteousness. - Subjective or mental counterpart of justa causa…. Distinctively christian, since it functioned as the key means of reconciling the christian duty of universal love with the rsort to force.

To Augustine, nothing was more reprehensible than, “The real evils in war, love of violence, revengeful cruelty, fierce and implacable enmity, wild resistance, and the lust of power and such like’.

Key component of just war : the normal condition of interntional ffairs is one of peace.
Peace is only a fiction. All states are by nature fighting an undeclared dwar against every other state.
No peace or war, but passsive and active hostility. There is only turbulence. Universe as a theatre of perpetual strife.
Confucian - even barbarians were not alien, merely imperfectly integrated into the great global order. There is natural law, ‘which exists everywhere has the same force and does not exist by people’s thinking this or that.’  The whole of humanity comprises a single moral, political society. In a global society that was orderly and rational, conflict and disorder must inevitably be seen as a pathological state of affairs.
Cicero - war should always be undertaken in such a way that one is seen to be aiming at peace. 


War must be waged, if at all, with reluctance, out of regrettable necessity and with a certain benevolent severity’.
Augustine - like a father applying corporal punishment to  a son for corrective purposes, with a motive of love.

War is not opposed to love of one’s enemies; for whoever wages war honourable hats, not individuals, but the ations which he justly condemns’.

For the crusades to the holy land, the justa causes was the unlawful occupation of the holy land by muslim aggressors, who proceeded to compound their sins by interfering with the access of christian pilgrims to the holy plces.

If a war is just, there is no such thing as neutrality.

______This feeling of despair that comes with the development of high minded ideals, and having them accompanied and implemented and taken advantage of by despicable people. E.G. Just War/ cause/ animus being manipulated to steal and oppress. Liberalism and freedom used by evil hedge funds to craft conset and laws to support them. It just works out so great in your head, then when implemented, the roaches find all the cracks and make them wider. Fear is the only thing that will ever keep them in line.

Later on, hallowed guardsmen try to get revenge on Ayram for the ambush which killed their compatriots.

War is a public and collective enterprise, arraying a whole people against a foreign foe. It is an exercise in social solidarity of the highest order. It is an error to think of it in terms of turbulence, confusion and anarchy. These factors may be present to be sure, perhaps in generous measure. But warfare calls for careful planning, preperation of many kinds - psychological, spiritual, logistical, and so forth - as well as rational execution. It is scientific 
A culture that is not cohesive will break. “Perhaps in some distant age, when weapons so powerful make war obsolete, societies will begin to fracture… if you do not exercise a muscle, you lose it.”

American indians had person -to -person conflict, but lacked any idea or practice of organised, collective combat. War is not a universal feture of the human condition.

Ares is often said to have been the god of war of ancient Greece, but this is not correct. His actual sphere of activity was violence o fthe interpersonal sort such as the wreaking of vengeance. Homer had him denounced by Athena as a bloodthirsty marauder, and by Hera as a mindless bully who knows no law… Warfare as an organised, disciplined, rationally conducted collective activity was the sphere of Athena, portrayed with a helmet and breastplate.Inimicus vs. hostis. Personal conflict vs. social conflict.

Plato - valour and bravado are not the principal traits sought in civilised warriors. What is needed is a cool-headed and disciplined devotion to the community interest. Never do anything except by combined and united action as members of a group.

Some criminal bands were large and unorganized. Latrociniae. Powerful and require militar scale. Operation could be mounted en masse, without any need for the scrupulous provision of proof of guilt. 

There is no such thing as a foreign society. There are barbarians on the bargain to be sure, but these are simply dark corners to which the light of chinese civilisation had, as yet, penetrated only partially. It is law enforcement, not war.

Cicero - a criminal band is not an enemy proper. An enemy state in wartimre was the foe only with the country with which it was at war, whereas the pirate was the common foe of all. Formal process for declaring war against organised foreign states, not against barbarians, brigans, pirates or the like. No obligation to keep faith with you, whereas there is for state enemies.

Extinction of the self in the community.

Ibn-Kaldoun - 14th century - Berber state being like a garden
There is no justice without the monarch. No Monarch without the army. No army without taxes. No taxes without wealth. No wealth without justice.

The world is a garden, and the fence of it is the dynasty.
The dynasty is authority, and through it customs are kept alive.
The customs are a way of governing, which is implemented by the sovereign,
The sovereign is a shepherd, and the soldiers help him,
The soldiers are helpers, and money provides for him,
Money is livelihood, that the flock gather,
The flock are slaves, devoted to the service of justice,
Justice is a norm, and it is alive in this world,
The world is a garden…



War a majestic constant throughout history across cultures. A protean thing, changing its fce throughout the course of recorded history in response to a dizzying array of factors. War so routine, so widely accepted, as to assume something of the character of a sporting contest or a ritual. An institution of international law.

Specific rules about war have never existed in a vacuum. It is the deep-seated conceptions about the nature and role of war in international relations.


The eternal struggle between agricultural and nomadic ways.

At some point war ceased to be regarded as natural or inevitable and came instead to be seen as a matter of conscious human choice. Migrated from the realm of instinct, or of divine command, to the domain of reason. Two separate gods of war : Ares vs. Athena. From that time onward, it became necessary to think about war - about offensive war, as a purposive activity.  (instead of border friction). Why embark upon war instead of remain at peace.

Confucian: War as a means of last resort, to counteract antisocial conduct and reinforce the norms which integrated the society into a harmonious whole.

Natural law - the entire world was under the rule of a single universal, transcultural set of moral principles. War was a handmaiden of justice. It’s purpose is not conquest or revenge or glory, but the vindication of the rule of law.

Cynicism, greed, and brutality have a wider field of play.

Christian knights indulged in a horrible massacre in liberating the tomb of their saviour, who had urged all men to turn the other cheek when smitten.

Dominant legal framework was that of natural law, with war seen primarily as a means of enforcing that law. Wars were fought on earth, but for purposes made in heaven.

1600-1815, metamorphosis of war from a tool of God into a tool of men. Law relating to war had a distinctly dualistic character - partly of nature, partly of culture. Wars were perfect if decked out in the fullest and most formal array, and otherwise imperfect.

War as clash of rival international interests rather than pursuit of heavenly ideals or more mundanely, the rule of law. A laissez-faire era, with war so firmly ensconced as a routine feature fo life that it unblushingly accorded the honourable status as an institution of international law.

Modern reversion to the medieval just-war outlook.Harness war and justice more tightly together than ever before. The deth of war as a legal institution. But war was dispiritingly tenacious.

Just as within a state some lawful power to punish crimes is necessary to preservation of domestic peace; so in the world as a whole, there must exist, in order that various states may dwell in concord, some power for the punishment of injuries inflicted by one state upon another; and this power is not found in any superior.- Fransisco Sua’rez

What you are touching on is the concept of the &quot;Just War&quot; and how this concept has developed throughout history.

I think a good, comprehensive overview of this subject is Stephen C. Neff's &quot;War and the Law of Nations&quot;. I know this sub generally looks unfavorably on posts that draw too heavily from one source, but Neff is solid and his book honestly provides a much more in-depth view to the subject than you'll get here. Any excerpts in this post will be taken from it. That being said, Neff is a professor of the history of International Law, and as he might say, lawyers are their own cheerleaders, so the book tends to focus on the views of the scholarly elites of any given culture (people who think about/write/make/execute the law) and what they had to say about the issue. It does not really approach the subject through a more broad anthropological lens which accounts for the common man.

To summarize, attitudes towards war have indeed transformed from one of war as a generally accepted state of nature, or a vengeful instinct, to one in which there are just and unjust causes for war, to our modern world which is increasingly particular about what justifies state violence against another state. Where I suspect your intuition is flawed, is in assuming that colonial imperialist attitudes towards war (war as a kind of natural right of strong nations) extends all the way back through history. This is not the case.

But first, Neff doesn't really mention the first recorded war in recorded human history (that we know of). This is the [Umma-Lagash war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umma%E2%80%93Lagash_war) This war was brought about when two neighboring city-states had a dispute over some fertile lands. Ancient Mesopotamia was not a particularly peaceful era, characterized by budding cities with defensive walls presided over by a strong man (called Lugal - literally, &quot;Big Man&quot;) each jostling for more and better lands.  I think it's important to remember that a city's temple and accompanying deity played a central role. People believed that they were only acting on their god's behalf. So this 'Sumerian Hundred Years War' was between the god Ningirsu of Lagash and the god Shara of Umma. Men fought and died, but the actual argument was between the gods.

What Neff does say about this early period:

&gt;There is evidence that, between certain types of peoples, war was, for all practical purposes, a natural occurrence, having something of the regularity and predictability of the seasons. The most obvious example was the eternal struggle around the great Asian steppe-lands between agricultural and nomadic ways of life, a conflict as ancient (in mythology at least) as the clash between Cain and Abel and as recent as (comparatively) the day before yesterday!
&gt;... That war and peace are opposite to one another m ay seem the most obvious proposition imaginable. But it is important to appreciate that this contrast has not been a universal feature of human social life. In particular, in situations of endemic or constant conflict between two peoples, such a contrast is not possible... In such a case, war would be, in a certain conceptual sense, invisible by virtue of its very ubiquity... The clearest example of endemic conflict from the classical world was the relation between civilized and barbarian states, which was commonly seen as one of natural and permanent hostility. 

We can see an example of this view in Plato's [Republic](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D5%3Apage%3D470).
In fact, fighting back the proverbial barbarians is one of the principle causes for war, though the people back then did not always consider fighting barbarians as 'warfare', but 'law enforcement'. The famous Roman orator Cicero stressed

&gt;... that a true enemy must be a state, possessing 'a Commonwealth, a Senate-house, a treasury, a consensus of like-minded citizens.'... a pirate group, Cicero explained, 'is not counted as an enemy proper'... a pirate was the 'common foe of all'...

As such, the formal process of declaring war was employed only against organized foreign states, not against barbarians, brigands, pirates or the like, and the Romans did not believe they had the obligation of keeping the faith with such an adversary - truce agreements, legal title to property captured, etc. 

According to the logic of Cicero, civil conflicts were also excluded from the category of war (again, it wasn't war, it was 'law enforcement'). This sentiment - a distinction between foreign war and civil conflict -  was shared by the Greeks.

&gt;In Greece, there were two separate words used for the two types of strife: *stasis* for internal conflict, and *polemos* for war against foreigners. It should be appreciated, however, that in practice, ancient societies did not always draw the boundary between these two categories of conflict in ways that make sense to us. Foreignness was often seen in moral or cultural terms, rather than in a strictly political sense, as is now the case. That meant that foreignness could be, and often was, a matter of subtle gradation rather than of sharp distinction...A consequence of this outlook was that armed conflicts between Greek city-states were considered to be, to some extent, examples of civil strife.

A super wild extreme and interesting of version of 'war as a corrective measure of law-enforcement' is found in Ancient China. 

&gt; Confucian tradition adopted the radically cosmopolitan position that China represented the one true civilization on earth. There was therefore, strictly speaking, no such thing as a truly foreign society. There were barbarian kingdoms on the margins of Chinese society, to be sure. But these were seen as, so to speak, dark corners to which the light of Chinese civilization had, as yet, penetrated only partially. Military action against these neighboring peoples was therefore perceived to be in the nature of law enforcement rather than of foreign war. 

From here we can begin to analyze the justifications for waging wars against foreign states. Generally speaking, war required some affirmative justification, that undertaking war was to uphold some larger community ideal. In other words a causus belli is required.

&gt;The Aztecs, for example, resorted to war over the mistreatment of travelling merchants, and also (rather more expansively) over a refusal by foreign peoples to enter into trading relations with them... The bible relates that, in ancient Israel, David made war against the Ammonites because of their brutality towards Israeli envoys. In Rome too, the mistreatment of ambassadors was a common justification for war, as were self-defense claims [for justifications for Rome's various wars, see Harris, *War and Imperialism* at 163-254; and Rich, *Declaring War* at 109-18]

&gt; There can be no doubt that many, if not all, of these formal causes were merely 'cover stories' given for public consumption or for formal purposes, with the true cause of the conflict lying elsewhere, in such considerations as political rivalry, greed for power and the like. 

That being said, there are some striking examples of adherence to just-cause principles. Notably (according to Heroditus) when Corinth withdrew its forces from the Spartan side because of a fear that it might be acting wrongfully, thereby bringing a halt to a Spartan invasion of Attica. Or win 240 BC, 

&gt;The Achean League took advantage of a succession crisis in Argos to invade the city-state with a view to overthrowing the government. The attempt failed; and Argos made a legal claim against the League for this act of aggression, with the city-state of Mantinea acting as the arbitrator. It is not clear whether the League consented to these proceedings, but the result was that Mantinea upheld Argos's claim and assessed a token fine of half a talent against the League.

The journey to get to thinking about war as a mere collision of naked interests like we see in the 19th century is a long one. Summarized in the interest of time, that journey runs first through the development of the conception of natural law in the classical world, then through the development of Christianity in the medieval world as it was the heir to the tradition of natural law. Before that could happen, Christianity had to jump through some hoops to get over it's pacifist roots. And those pacifist roots were strong. Jesus didn’t say ‘turn the other cheek’ for nothing. Most notably, Tertullian argued that no Christians should perform military service, on authority of the Gospels. So obviously, he and others like him would have condemned wars of aggression (expect of course, in the case of barbarians). How Christian writers got over this radical pacifism is a story for another day.

&gt; Once the hurdle of Christian pacifism had been overcome, the intellectual path was open towards an elaboration of a theory of just wars along the lines adumbrated by Cicero and other writers in the classical, natural-law tradition. Its essence may be stated with the utmost brevity: a just war was a war waged for the enforcement of right and the eradication of evil.

By 1300, Christian thinkers developed generally agreed-upon criteria for a war to be considered just. It must be waged by a sovereign, implying commission from his community. Only certain people are allowed to be involved (Women, children, infirm, etc. were not). There must be a causus belli, such as a disputed title or demand for compensation of injury. There must be a just cause, waged in the pursuit of a valid legal claim, and here 'just cause' was an objective question, as a sincere, but erroneous belief in the rightness of one's legal cause would not suffice. And finally, a war must be waged with 'rightful intention'. i.e. a just war is waged &quot;not out of hatred, but out of love, for the purpose of correcting evil and bringing the enemy to the path of righteousness.&quot;

It should be noted that, for all of the idealism and other-worldliness of the theologians who elaborated the medieval just-war schema, there was no general illusion that the virtuous side would inevitably triumph. There were plenty examples at hand, both in reality and in the bible, of the wicked vanquishing the innocent on the field of battle. So, of course those who adhered to this just-war framework understood that some belligerents might be evil or misbehaving, and these neer-do-wells were criticized as such.

This framework eventually came under attack in the 17th century, from two angles. First, we have the Hobbesian view of the state of nature. Whereas medieval theologians viewed the state of nature to be one of peace, Hobbes claimed it was one of conflict. Second, the old just-war system was seen to apply in times of peace as well as war, whereas a new school of thought,  called the contractual school (or dueling school,) claimed that war involved the substitution of a new judicial order for an old one.

&gt; War must now be seen not, as in the medieval natural-law tradition, as an exceptional phenomenon, nor as an emergency law-enforcement operation. Instead, war must now be regarded as a normal and intrinsic feature of interstate life, and peace as the exception.

&gt; The essence of the contractual theory of war may be stated very simply. It rejected the mainstream tradition's law-enforcement model of war, in favour of an image of war as a contract between two parties to settle a quarrel by force of arms - i.e. as a duel. 

&gt; According to the Hobbesian approach, there could be no reason for two countries that were in a state of nature to declare war against one another, since, by definition, they were *already* in a state of war... For the contractual school, the question of how to create a state of war amounted to the question of how, precisely, to go about concluding a war contract. 

From this point, we finally arrive to the laissez-faire era that was the 19th century, the era of 'Positivism'. Positivism, according to Neff, is 'so protean a phenomenon as to defy neat characterization.' 

&gt;As applied to international law generally, and to the activity of war particularly, it may be thought of as an evolved version of the voluntary-law or Hobbesian outlook.  That is to say, it perceived law as a fundamentally a human creation, a product of culture rather than of nature... international law was now seen instead in humanistic and cooperative terms, as a law *between* states, crafted by the states themselves wholly for their own use....From the Hobbesian tradition, it took the acceptance of the world as fundamentally completive and anarchic, with no assumption of peace as a normative condition of international relations...From the contractual approach, positivism inherited a ritualistic or sporting ethos, a stress on war as a rigorous rule-bound contest, conducted in what could almost be called a formal manner, by professional armed forces... Positivist thought was no monolithic doctrine. It had something of a patchwork flavor, with the result that the structure that it built, while impressive in its detail, was also riddled with uncertainties and controversies. 

Because it was 'riddled with uncertainties and controversies', it should come as no surprise to find that not everyone subscribed to it's conception of war, its justifications for it, and the supremacy of states. For example, it's here that we see the rise of guerrilla and partisan conflict, and there were certainly cases of internal public pressure putting a stop to the those decision-makers at the top who saw war as a matter of policy (as in the Franco-Prussian war). And remnants of just-war thought continued to persist amongst lawyers like Kaspar Bluntschli, H.W. Halleck and writer Travers Twiss, all people who criticized the motivations for these conflicts.

There is *a lot* to be said on the Positivist conception of war and the legal framework for it. Much was written about the art of intervention, perfect and imperfect wars, aggression, etc. etc. Ultimately this legal framework culminating in two world wars and nuclear proliferation. Out of this near apocalyptic scenario we see a shift away from Positivism and back towards a 'just-war order', not necessarily because of any appeal to natural law, but because of obvious practical concerns. Warfare between modern states is simply too catastrophic to accommodate dueling states.

            <Text>Make sure mandri’s body has a knife wound in the chest.
“Holy hell, it’s almost still sticky.”

Two travelers set out into the Sand alone.
One is a man who expects to much. The other is a woman who expects too little. 
They happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Empty Portion, hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundred of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in the most inhospitable place, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance. You see, he actually expects to find a bit of strangeness like this every now and then, after all, the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he’s stumbled upon in the vastness of this old sand sea and all he can see is a strange coincidence.
A simple coincidence.
Thats all it is to him. That’s all it is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, she is stunned by the significance of moment. She did not expect to see someone in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two souls to meet in such a wasteland without planning it, well it couldn’t be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for a purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. It is short and seemingly pointless. It is called the Nine Line Story because that’s all there is to it - nine lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say that the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in the vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for divine providence to be revealed, but who can say for certain?
Orthodox freaks preach that there must be another tablet. It’s not worth asking why - it’s a conclusion wrought from a peculiar twist of logic and eschatology that’s not worth getting into. What matters is that they claim the next tablet will prove that the story is a story about Solraheen himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. They’re people. People floundering around for a glimpse of the divine like everyone else. Maybe the man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Soreel believed. In fact he believed that the pair never existed at all. He’d tell anyone who’d listen to his liquored up sermons that the story, the raw events themselves, they weren’t important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson there in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a simple question:
 What if the woman went into the Empty Portion and made it safely through without encountering a soul? Would she have glimpsed the divine plan then? 
No. 
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, and wouldn’t have given a thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety. She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries. She never would have shed a tear at the wonder - but the wonder would be there all the same. And that’s the lesson. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. To be struck dumb by the sight of the His plan in one case and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. Both travelers were blinded by expectations, and blind is the word because it takes righteous eyes to see the will of Solraheen.
And it’s always expectations that is the problem. This was Seb’s contribution that growing puddle called man’s philosophy. Expectations weren’t necessarily the source of man’s damnation, but they sure were a sign of it. Expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. Seb liked to put it a little more bluntly: “Expectations ruin everything”. And that’s how it was. None of this stopped him from having expectations himself. No one is perfect. No one except Solraheen.
Seb once stumbled upon a bald, aching, stiff-jointed pilgrim who claimed that if you don’t have righteous eyes then the next best thing to have is nothing at all. The pilgrim claimed to be able sit perfectly still and chant his mind into such a trance that his body required no food or water, nor even air, and more importantly, he said his thoughts were free from expectations.
Seb tried to induce this meditative trance in himself, but he couldn’t do it. He doubted the old pilgrim could either, at least not for any meaningful length of time. Sitting still and simply existing is what a rock does, and people aren’t rocks. People look at things, and when they look they try to understand and when they try to understand the expectations inevitably come. 
Seb figured that if he had to have some expectations then best thing to do was to expect as little as possible. Err on the side of the woman traveler. At least she had some appreciation for Solraheen’s mysteries. To add to that, having no expectations and expecting to not have anything were close enough to the same thing. They used a lot of the same words. Like if you took those words and put them in a bag and shook that bag around then there’s no telling which idea you’ll get out of it. Seb figured maybe life works that way. Maybe if he had an idea-enough-like-the-right-idea, then when life shook him up like it always did, he might pop on over to the correct frame of mind. Like how a fisherman puts a shrimp on a hook, and then, with a jerk and a heave, that shrimp becomes a fish. Put a fact on a hook and you’ll pull up a truth. Maybe if he fished with the a crumb of an expectation he’d pull up the untethered void of the self reflected in the eye of Solraheen.
Until then, he’d had to wait. 
He had to keep his expectations low. 
It was a natural enough thing to do. Thirty years of living in a land that some languages call Emptiness has that effect.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. He knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the hills from rain, how the Utzal wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Bengas mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces looking down at you. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders, their chins tufted with thornscrub. It seemed like even the weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. They used make it up over the Hias and the Junei plain was a paradise. The evidence was there in the foothills. If you got up into the ridges of the Hias and looked north towards the Junei Plain you could see the lighter clay of long-dried out washes snaking through the foothills for as far as there were foothills.
Of course, when you’re down in those foothills you don’t notice them. Down there you only see sun baked clay and that clay is so hard that you can’t imagine it had ever seen rain. To illustrate: one night, Seb spit on the ground and when he woke, five whole hands later, the glob of his spit was still there. The water of his body hadn’t seeped into the dirt. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi leaves he chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. And so nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and a lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to drink the urine. 
Birds don’t count either because they’re just passing through. 
You could find beetles if you ripped the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes you’d have to bore into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is that their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and you can’t boil or steam it out, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that can keep you alive and the things that can kill you.
Everything else is nothing. 
That being said, there’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them; they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
And that’s what Seb saw as he stood atop one of the Hias foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain. He saw nothing. There wasn’t even a horizon for it was lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only its not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed his world, because it looks like something, but really it’s nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.
“Oi, Seb! There's somethin ‘ere!”
Seb’s ears pricked at the words. The shout had come from a nearby ravine.
Quick and spry as lizard zipped up on freeweed, Seb scrambled over to the lip of that ravine and leered down into its deep belly. 
One of his fellow Ayramun was standing there at the bottom of it. Seb knew it was Gugi and not anyone else by the way he stood. Everyone was swaddled from head to toe in brown wool dusted red by clay, but only Seb and Gugi stood with that twitchy restlessness that marks out a Jandri man who’s not stopped chewing the spines of borcandi leaves since the day they were weened from the tit. And Gugi was also a little taller than most. A little lankier. He stuck his skinny arm up in the air and waved it towards Seb.
Seb sneered at the way the joints creaked like a corpse. — you get it.
“Put your goddamned hand down,” Seb shouted. “I can see you just fine.”
“Then get your ass down here!” Gugi shouted back.
Seb harrumphed to himself and then started his climb down into the ravine.
As far as ravines go it seemed as full of nothing as any other. It was a little steeper than most, and it was dry and dusty so Seb’s feet couldn’t find purchase on the slope. He was forced into a clumsy half-scramble-half-slide to get down the bottom, which was about twenty yards down. Once there he took a moment to kick the clay off the heel of his boot.
There was one truly unusual thing about this ravine, and that’s how even and straight it was. Almost like a road. It went straight as an arrow for a full fifty yards before getting lost around a bend. Smack-dab in the middle of those fifty yards was the dried out husk of a karkle bush. Gugi was standing in front of that bush, looking a little spooked.
Seb took his time ambling on over, and he fingered a fresh borcandi spine out of his sleeve pocket as he went. He knew there wouldn’t be nothing worth noticing because Gugi had a habit of pointing out any old thing that caught his interest. Maybe there’d be a pricked-up drag-belly hissing inside that bush, but fat little lizards doing four-legged push-ups and flashing their ruddy throats weren’t worth shouting about. 
They weren’t something.
They were to be expected.
Part of the ignorable blur.
Seb almost laughed at the way Gugi urged him on with an impatient flick of the wrist. 
“I ain’t gonna run in this heat,” Seb said.
Gugi shook his head and mumbled something Seb couldn’t hear. 
“Pipe down, coon’s sake, I’m comin’.”
Seb eyed the karkle bush. There was definitely something hidden underneath its twiggy branches. A lumpy shape of something shadowed. It was dark and unmoving and apparently unconcerned with how Gugi was brushing the karkle’s branches aside to get a better look. 




  karkle bush, he expected to see the bush’s woody stem firmly planted into red clay. There might be pebbles, and maybe a rock or two that he’d have to move, but that was it. He didn’t expect to see a creature hiding under those wide boughs. If you’d asked him before hand what kind of creature he’d expect to see out there,he’d say a black-spined drag-belly because drag-bellies lived on this side of the Junei plain. Odd for them to be out at this time of day, just-past-morning, when the sun is getting hot and even the shade of the bush doesn’t do enough to stop the heat. Odd but not quite strange. It would be a strange, very strange, to find the dead body of a boy. Now that he did not expect.

“You know, this is the first bush I looked under.”
“What?”
“Yeah. It’s the first bush I looked under. I was like, this bush is in the perfect position, halfway up the ravine, bet it will be the best spot to -”
“You’re saying it’s the first bush you looked under?”
“Yeah.”
“
It was the first bush he’d looked under, too. There were at least twenty other bushes in that dusty ravine, and the first one he looked under sheltered a dead boy. 
A strange coincidence.
A divine sign.
Seb’s skin prickled.


Gugi was stumbling his way down to the road because he thought he’d heard Seb say that he’d found a body. When he hopped on over to where Seb was standing, he pulled his scarf down under his proud chin to ask for clarification. He rarely stopped chewing. His words were a little lost in between the squelches.
“Didn’t quite get that.”
Seb pulled his own scarf down in kind. His face was a little thinner than Gugi’s, and his nose was longer and crooked, and his cheeks were ravaged with pits from . He chewed his borcandi spine a bit more gingerly because most of his teeth thin were thick with rot. Anyone who meets the twins, especially if they meet them at the same time, the first thought is always to wonder why the gods had reserved all the handsomeness for Gugi. The second thought is to wonder if poor Seb had been cursed, or if it was just bad luck - poor Seb thought he was cursed with bad luck.
And this was why seb was so stuck in coincidences. For he and his brother had coincided in the womb.
“Look there,” Seb said to Gugi.
“Where?”
“Feet here,” Seb said. “And you can see an arm, and there, a grayish cloak of somewhat.”
Gugi squatted down next to the bush and tried to peer under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“A body, eh? Guess he’s dead?”
“He’s not napping.”
“Well… pull him out then.”
“Pull him out?”
“The mans dead. He won’t mind.”
Seb’s jaw dropped. All his little crooked teeth. Blinked like he couldn’t believe, had to reboot the brain. “There’s a dead body under this bush, and that doesn’t concern you in the least bit? You just want to, what, pull him out and rifle through his clothes?”
“No. I want to pull him out wo we can put him somewhere else.&quot;
“Just put him somewhere else?”
“Isn’t that why you called me down here?”
“I called you down here because there’s a goddamned dead body under my bush… out here, under this bush... That doesn’t get your grind going? The boy’s still bleeding!”
Gugi took a little rock and pushed on mandri’s foot, squeezed a drop of blood through the blood caked blisters. his dark brows raised a little as he realized that this wasn’t just a dead body, it was a freshly dead body. Still, he wasn’t about to encourage Seb’s hysteria, so the most assent he was willing to do was to shrug and say, “Alright. This is unusual.”
“Unusual?!” Seb spun around to face Gugi and was about to burst. “It’s a goddamned curse! Clear as day!”
“Come on Seb, don’t start.”
“Start what? There’s a goddamned dead body in my hiding spot!”
“Calm down! Holy hell. It’s just a dead body. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Seb was about to burst, but then a shrewd thought popped his 
“Did you put this here?” He asked.
“What?” Gugi’s face was streteched beyond belief.
“Did you put this dead body here?”
“What?”
A moment.
“You think I’d kidnap some random bloke back in Solstan, haul his ass all the way out here, then kill him and stuff him up under your bush, just get you all stirred up?”
A smile started to spread on Gugi’s face when he realized that was exactly what Seb was thinking.
That smile was, to Seb, as good an admittance of guilt as any.
A dawnign as the rage started to take Sabe. Gugi came clean before he could blow. 
“Relax! Holy hell. Goddamn. Relax. I didn’t do it.”
“Then who did?” Seb asserted. “This body is fresh as a daisy’s bum. If there was someone skulking around these hills, planting bodies under bushes to put us off, we would have seen him. Had to be one of the Ayramun. And if it was any of them, it’d be you.”
“Ay-ya. Seb. No one is trying to curse you. This poor bik under your bush has nothing to do with us. He’s probably some wayward pilgrim who crawled up under there to eat the dirt and forgot to wake up. It doesn't mean anything. It’s just a dead body. It doesn’t even smell. Just get up in there, and lets get on with it.”'
&quot;I’m not cuddlin' up with no dead body,&quot; Seb said. &quot;And in point of fact, this ain’t no pilgrim road. This ain’t no pilgrim. It’s a dead body out in the middle of nowheres - not the middle of nowheres, its right in the middle of my bush, and that’s the clearest shout of a curse I’ve ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this.&quot;
“He doesn’t need to hear about this.&quot;
&quot;Have you lost your water? Ayram ought to know there's a dead body down here!&quot;
&quot;Don't worry Ayram with this shit. Just get in that bush and stop moaning.&quot;
&quot;How abouts you get in that bush?&quot;
&quot;Okay. I will. I’ll do it if it will stop your shitting.&quot;
&quot;No! You’re not getting in that bush.&quot;
“But you just said -”
“I’m not gonna let you cuddle up under no cursed demon bush right before shit gets hot.”
“Someone’s getting in this bush. There’s no time to be scrying and softing about what is and isn’t cursed.”
Seb grabbed his brother’s shoulder before he could pull himself up under the karkle bush.
&quot;Look around,&quot; Gugi said. &quot;There aren't any other spots.&quot; He gestured to the sloped walls of the ravine. If a rock was big enough, or a divot in the earth deep enough, a fellow bandit was already settling in. Most were lying down up top, above the ravine's lip. 
Gugi crawls up under. Bunch of rustling as he tries to get comfortable. He can’t. “He’s kinda funny looking”. Has second thoughts.
“Holy shit!”
“What! What is it?!”
“I know who this is.”
“Who?”
“Holy shit.”
“Who is it?!”
Gugi scrambled out from under the bush much faster, much less carefully than how he got in.”
Seb looked at him expectantly, eyes wide and . Gugi was finally looking properlly of haveing seen a dead body.
“Thats fucking Salavan Saran’s kid!”
“Who?”
“Salavan Saran’s kid! What’s his name? Man- something. That’s Salavan’s kid under that bush.”
“Oh shit?”
“Yeah thats him.”
“You sure?”
“Pull him out and see for yourself.”
“I’ve never seen him before. Wouldn’t be able to recognise him.”
“Pull him out anyways. Because you’re right, Ayram needs to know about this.”
“I ain't touchin' no dead body.”
“Dammit. Seb. Grab his foot.”
“You grab his foot!”
“I’m going to!” Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of Mandri’s left ankle. He stared at Seb and shook Mandri’s ankle to show Seb just how tightly he was holding on. Mandri’s foot flopped around like limp fish. Seb took a step backwards.
“Now grab the other foot,&quot; Gugi said.
Seb crossed his arm and shook his head. “Do it yourself.”
“Seb.”
“Gugi.”
“Seb , if you don’t squat down and do a part, I’m gonna start breakin rules.”
Seb scoffed and kicked the dirt. “I ain’t touchin’ no dead body.”
Gugi rubbed his temples. He hated that he had to be the bigger boy. Seb had this way ever since they were kids, this stubbornness, it worked to get him what he wanted, which was always something new and shiny and . Gugi hated resorting to this, to losing Seb’s stupid games, but there wasn’t time to stamp his foot and wrestle it out.
“Okay Seb, what do you want.”
“To get the hell away from that dead body.”
“Help me carry it to Ayram and I’ll give you my shard of salcite.”
Troble speaking with the borkine spine but they do it anyway.
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. His jaw went slack and the borkine spine nearly slipped out of his mouth.
“The pointy shard?” He asked.
Gugi nodded. “The pointy one.”
A moment,
“How about it?”
“I can’t take your salcite,” Seb said. “That kind of stone can’t be parted with.”
“Hell.”
“It’s the lucky stone. If you got rid of it, passed it on without the best of reasons, you’d be cursin’ yourself as bad as as this dead body is cursin’ me. That stone is alive. Elemental. It found you, you didn’t find it.”
“It’s a goddamned stone.”
“There’s no such thing as a ‘goddamned’ stone. If you ever listened to Ayram, you’d know that.”
Gugi pulled the stone in question out of his pocket. Describe it. 
He held it up between his finger and his thumb, so that Seb could get a good look at it.
“Help me carry the body,” Gugi said, “or I’ll crush this thing into a million pieces, and then I’ll scatter the crumblings around you as you sleep.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“I’ll mumble the witch’s anguish as I do it.”
“You don’t know the words to the witch’s anguish.”
“I didn’t say I’d chant it, I said I’d mumble it, and as long as I get the cadence right, thats good enough to get the demons stirring.”
“You’re not gonna do that.”
“I will if you don’t help me.”
Seb’s brow returned to its near-permanent scowl. His mind raced for some way to get out of this situation. Gugi was a stubborn ass, and even though Seb knew that Gugi didn’t put stock in curses and luck and mystery, he knew that Gugi would do it if it meant annoying him. 
But if Gugi couldn’t be moved, maybe someone else could. 
He turned round to face the other side of ravine, and called over to the young Papillion, who was busy nestling into the dirt behind a boulder.
“Hey Papi! Come help us move something!”
Papi had been listening the whole while to Seb and Gugi’s little argument. He knew full well there was a body there in the bush. This close to the ambush, people weren’t supposed to be talking, much less shouting, so he showed Seb the back of his finger, and went back to burying himself.
Gugi saw this and said to Seb, “Even Papi won’t put up with your shit. Always trying to get out of things. If I weren’t in charge of this little squad, then I’d leave and make you do it yourself.”
“I’m not trying to get out of anything. It’s just good sense to make someone else do it. The body isn’t cursing Papi, it’s cursing me!”
“That’s trying to get out of it. Now, we both carry him.”
“It's a limp body. It's easier if just one person carries him.”
“And how you figure that?”
“It’s a limp body.”
“Seb, if you don’t grab that leg… 
Change tact.
“I don’t want you to get in trouble. See, I’m gonna hike all the way back to Ayram, alone, and he’s gonna ask me what I’m doin there tellin him about a dead body instead of showin it to him. And I don’t want to blame you for not helping, but that’s the truth. And then he’s gonna make an example out of you.”
“Ayram will understand.”
“If thats what you think, then fine.”
Nothing to do but march off to Ayram. The quick, easy step of a man unburdond by guilt. Soft, head up.
“Wait! Wait.”
Gugi stopped.
“I’ll help.”
Huffing , making a scene out of touching it. Grumbling and complaining all the way back to the plateau.
 Rope, gugi climbs up first, little moment where Seb is staring at the body, then body gets hauled up, and seb climbs up after.

Shelf of rock, titlted, like the corner of a broken table of the gods half-sunk into the sand.


Ayram grabbed Mandri’s right arm and threw him up and over his shoulder, like he was taking off with poached game. He then clambered up the scree, both hands free, easily balancing Mandri’s light weight. In fact, Mandri felt so light that he thought this giant of a man could have thrown him up to the cliff’s edge with one arm. That would have been as comfortable.
When they came to the cliff face Ayram let out a shrill whistle, and a rope came tumbling down from above. Ayram twirled this scratchy rope around Mandri’s waist, deftly knotted it with his long, deft fingers, then tugged it tight, and then Mandri was off.
Mandri bounced along as the rope pulled him up the cliff face. Along the way caught sight of people down in the ravine. The sight of their little heads popping out from behind rocks and boulders, or the lip of the ravine on either side of the road, was shocking. They’d been there the whole time, and he’d walked right through the middle of them.



 He could see ill omens in the darting flight of a black bird. Blabh blah blah. Or, as now, in the body of a boy under a bush.
This was a strange coincidence because he was about to hide up under this bush. That there was a dead body already there - freshly dead by the look of him - well that was a strange coincidence indeed.
 Solraheen has seen special care to him
Blue eyes staring into a bush at a body, where a body should not be.
 

If he had lived another hour longer he would smelled the musky odor of sweat and beak oil wafting down from the top of the ravine. He would have heard the soft patter of footsteps on the dusty road. He would have seen the bark-sheathe boots a man stop right in front of his bush, and he would have felt two blue-grey eyes gawking down at him through the spaces in-between the karkle's twigs. 
Two blue-grey eyes, Jandri eyes, belonging to a man named Seb Soreel. They were sparkling, bright and curious, and they narrowed as they searched Mandri’s bundled body for any sign of life. Seb thought it would be strange to find someone here on the side of the road, but he knew it would be a bad, bad omen if that someone was dead.

            <Notes>The mechanics of it is simple: expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. Only when something ‘strange’ occurs does a person transfixed by expectations pay attention to what is really happening around them. Even then, there’s no guarantee they’ll see the beauty of it.

It’s not hard to understand why the bound book calls for people to live without expectations.

After all, what is something strange but something improbable, and can’t the improbable be explained away by the fact that the world is small and full of chance encounters? 

for as the Bound Book says:
An empty well is also filled with purpose,
An arrow in the dirt has also hit its mark,
He weaves all mysteries just below the surface,
If one had but righteous eyes to pierce the dark.

But whether they admit it or not, Solraheen’s will is there and it is always there. It’s there in the great and the small, in the mundane and the truly awesome, all it takes is righteous eyes to see it. 



Seb, your personality is like a weed. Every time I pull it out, it grows right back.

“You don’t see it? This is a glimpse into the divine pattern!”



It’s not worth noticing strange coincidences because everything that happens is strange.  Some coincidences may seem more strange than others, but that’s just a symptom of expectations, which are themselves a symptom of ignorance. A Mazydai would go even further and warn that having even the simplest expectation about what should or should not happen is a grave sin. It’s a sin of pride, they warn, because the ultimate cause of all events is Solraheen’s will, so to expect that something will happen is to place expectations on Solraheen Himself.</Notes>

            <Synopsis>Theives ambush gold caravan in the desert. A witch conjures storm to help them. Caravan has a mage, but storm strikes down mage before he can kill thieves. Turns out not to be a gold train - was a setup - The man who set them up? Salavan Saran.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The poet Mandrameen once said that every artist who has tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. For him the problem is always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see - but nothing is more seductive than Nature. Nothing can match it’s grandeur and complexity at scale, for inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns for as far as it is possible to look. The shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and if the mood is right, it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve.
Mandrameen taught that the Sand focuses this beauty. There the desert heat pulls the mind out from the body, like a cork from a bottle, and if you are left to linger in the sun, near to death, then all desires, plots, and fantasies will evaporate. Nothing is left to support a delicate ego. When Nature’s beauty rushes in it flushes the ego out, it loses it in the wide open spaces of sand and sky. All that’s left for the inner eye to see is the truth about the edge between one’s self and the Universe.
Or so Mandrameen believed. 
It was at least an honest attempt to explain why all religions of the Empire were born in the Sand, and why the beating heart of each of them is the grand city of Jeket, Jewel of the Desert, an oasis in the middle of the world. 
The cynic Seculla took a different view. She claimed that prophets and messiahs flock to the Sand - and Jeket in particular - because gold flows through it. The stuff filters into the city from mines in the interior, and once the cut is taken, it leaves down river then out to sea towards Carcina, the Empire’s capital. 
Whether or not this is true is a matter of taste. But it cannot be denied that, for many folk, gold is more tempting than eternal salvation. After all, gold is just as bright and as immutable as the Divine, but you can touch it. If a pure, soft, sparkling spot of it gets into your hands you’ll be struck with a yearning akin to spiritual rapture, a yearning for more of it, for as much as you can get. The more enterprising religions channel this effect by casting the gold into idols. They pour it into molds and curse-pots, and they use it to ornament their sacred texts and the walls of their heavenly dwellings. The way that gold scintillates in the candlelight of a dark and cloistered room creates an impression of holiness that is strong enough to lure even the weakest pilgrims out to shrines nestled deep in the Sand. In such hallowed places, the chosen few may hear whispered invitations leap out of the rock, or out of the sand or sky, but godless folk claim that its just the whisperings of the gold, for they hear it too. They can hear it even while it sits in the ground, and like pious men they devote their lives to the call. 
The only person on the Earth who worshiped neither the Gods , and neither the Gold, was Ayram. He was religious in his own way, a thief of a kind, but chiefly he was known as Evil, and he was simply too skilled to ever be captured. 
Elrahet would say, “Too cautious to be captured”, and as the eldest of Ayram’s band that was how she liked it. She was sensitive to the risks that younger folk were willing to take, for she had made many of them herself - her fake brass nose could attest to that. For Elrahet, it was a reminder of her duty to preach caution and steer the young pups away from prey that fights back. This imperative dwelled deep in her old arthritic bones, for they would get to tingling whenever danger was near, just as they were tingling now.
“This doesn’t seem right,” she grumbled to Ayram. Her voice hoarse and scratchy from years of freeweed abuse. She peered through the lens of her scopic copper tube which was balanced upon a stick. From her perch high in the strata of a sandstone cliff, she could pick out the riders of a distant merchant caravan, and could count their number all the way back to the rear of their column. 
“Seventy-two... and there’s something unnatural about them,” Elrahet said.  “I don’t think we should go for it.”
Ayram was standing next to her, taller by at least three feet. He was a giant of a man but skinny, and all his limbs were wrapped tight in wool and leather as if to accentuate his ganglyness.
He was stroking his scraggly beard as he tracked Elrahet’s gaze.
“What do you mean ‘something unnatural’?” he asked.  
With his vision unaided, Ayram could only make out the dust cloud kicked up by the distant caravan - it billowed high into the air and shone brightly as the early morning light picked it out against the darker blue of the fleeing night sky. 
“There’s an odd fix about them.” Elrahet said.
“An odd fix? You’ve counted seventy-two. That’s exactly how many Salavan said there’d be, and they’re coming along at exactly the right time and place.”
“I don’t doubt your man in Jeket. But still, something is off.”
Ayram kept silent to give Elrahet time to study their quarry. It would be stupid to ignore the mood of a woman whose misgivings had saved them several times before.
“It’s the way they ride,” Elrahet concluded. She moved aside to let Ayram peer through the scope. “Have you ever seen a caravan guard ride three by three like that?” she asked. 
Ayram bent down on one knee and put his eye to the rim of the brass eyepiece. The wagons and their guard quickly came into focus.
“No,” he replied. 
“I don’t think we should go for it,” Elrahet repeated.
Ayram shrugged her off and took a moment to absorb the details. 
There were eight wagons, several more than the average for a gold train, and the tight discipline of the riders made it easy to count their number; three by three as Elrahet had said. Hardly the ragged band of backwash from the Empire’s conquests that passed for caravan hands this far out in the Sand. Ayram couldn’t make out any insignia or marks that might identify them as professional soldiers. Still, they were quite far out on the Junei plain, and Elrahet’s old scope was a little dusty. 
Ayram compared what he saw to the lay of the ambush that he had set up below. It seemed the most ideal spot to bushwhack such a heavily guarded merchant caravan. It was one of the few short and straight ravines through which a road actually passed. Its slopes were steep so his people would have a clean shot at the whole column, provided all seventy-two and all eight wagons could fit inside. Though there were few trees, there were plenty of boulders and prickly brown bushes for cover. The way out of the ravine was easy enough to manage with caltrops buried in the sand. They had even bolted in an iron trip-line to prevent a retreat.
Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. 
Against experienced warriors, Ayram was not so sure.
“If they weren’t wearing that woolen garb I’d take them for Imperial cavalry,” Ayram said.
“It could be that they’ve been drilling common hands,” Elrahet suggested.
“That could be.”
“Or, it could be that those really are Imperial riders.”
“But they’re wrapped in white wool.”
“Sure, sure. But I’m wrapped in wool and I’m Imperial. Used to be anyways,” Elrahet said.
“An Imperial priestess, not an officer,” Ayram corrected. “Officers don’t drop their company’s colors for convenience. Even in the desert.”
Elrahet laughed. “The Sand makes converts of us all, Ayram. Uniforms be damned.” At that she spit off the side of the cliff and watched it fall. It swayed a little in the cool breeze and landed fifty yards below, where the boy Sendren was stringing his helmwood bow. Sendren looked up at Elrahet and muttered a curse, but Elrahet just shook her head and pointed up above her, innocently directing Sendren’s ire towards Relsa who was perched atop the cliff.
“The point of a uniform isn’t comfort,” Ayram said. “For them it’s hardly even for protection.  It’s about distinction.” 
“Sure, sure. But still,” Elrahet said.
“Yes,” Ayram relented, “they could be fighting men.”
“They could be rabble, they could be Imperials. Would it change your call?” Elrahet asked, thinking she knew the answer.
“If they are Imperial then they’ll have skin in the game.”
“They won’t run when the killing starts,” Elrahet said, finishing his thought.
“And the way we’re set up -”
“This only works if they try to run.”
“It’s only completely safe if they run.” 
“So it’s off then.”
Ayram took a moment once more to eye the caravan through Elrahet’s scope, trying to find some detail that might still swing his decision. 
The information he’d been given by Salavan was accurate - the caravan was here as predicted. He and his people were eager, rested, and ready. Smooth sandstone boulders were levered. The long shadows of the rising sun would keep them hidden until the most opportune moment. There was even the off chance that the witch’s magic might work. Most importantly, their secret way into and out of the ravine was a hidden crevasse which remained unknown to the Empire, and every day that Ayram delayed he risked its discovery. If found, this stretch of the Junei would be closed to him forever.
“Disciplined riders aren’t enough to call this off,” Ayram finally decided, and handed the glass back to Elrahet. 
“Then should I whistle the boys?” Elrahet asked, looking a little grim. It was a look which came quite easy for her.
“Yes,” Ayram replied. “Be sure to stab and flutter it. We need a little extra caution.”
 Elrahet nodded, then put her hands to her mouth and whistled the song of the Jade Tresset to let the men know that the ambush was on. She stabbed and fluttered the high notes, as Ayram had directed.
Ayram waited a bit for twittered replies to spring from his people’s hiding spots, and then he squeezed his giant frame into the little cave behind him.
Cloistered within the cramped cave was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, ten years younger than Elrahet, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Ayram, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree.  Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The beast was belly up, and her fingers were knuckle deep in it’s guts, twisting and twirling as her lips whispered incantations and her eyes searched the pink sliver of morning sky that peeked through the crack in the rocks above.
“It’s almost time,” Ayram warned.
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, though she did not take her eyes off the sky, nor her hand from the lizard’s corpse.
“What thing is more vital than blood?” she asked the world. 
“Blood cold as ice…” 
She pushed down with the palm of her hand to squeeze acids out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Blood hot as a raging fire….” 
She squeezed the intestinal organs with her knotted fingers. 
“We would be gods if not for blood…”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up.
“We would be dust without it.” 
Elrahet threw the entrails down, back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
When nothing happened, she snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.
The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Ayram supposed that the thing was somehow still alive. When Elrahet finally pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh, it went completely limp.
“It is possible,” Elrahet said to Ayram in a quiet whisper so that none outside could hear, “that the beast is infertile.” 
“So this won’t work?” Ayram knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Ayram spread apart the lizard’s corpse. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines writhed and pulsed like a knotted mass of worms. 
He was impressed.
“Well... it was worth a try,” he said.
Elrahet hissed at his dubiety. “I just need fertile blood. Fresh fertile blood,” she stressed.
Ayram thought for a moment, then pulled up his sleeve and extended his hairy brown arm towards Elrahet.
“Your blood? I won’t carve you open,” Elrahet croaked. “Get me one of the Pazard boys or something.”
“There’s no time. It’s either me or Elrahet... Or no one.” 
“That old Imperial sow isn’t fertile.”
“Well then,” Ayram said, extending his arm further.
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given by one Jandrian to another. Elrahet had been Ayram’s witch for years and he had never offered a drop. She tried to gauge his countenance to see if he was sincere - but his face was set deep in the shadow of his hood and his eyes were sunk back behind bushy brows. His beard hid whatever slight expression his lips might reveal. Even clean shaven and in direct light, the difference between his smile and a frown was almost imperceptible. 
She looked down at his arm and eyed the veins that bulged under the skin. She knew his blood would be potent. 
“We can do this without you,” Ayram said with more than a hint of impatience.
At that, Elrahet pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from her bag and laid them between herself and Ayram. Then she unsheathed a patterned blade from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise to Ayram’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said.
“And I yours,” Ayram replied. 
Elrahet savored his courtesy with a near-toothless grin, then eagerly plunged her dagger’s tip into his flesh. She flicked her wrist with expert care and opened the vein. Ayram remained unstirred, watching with serious intent as blood bubbled out of the wound and ran around his wrist in a steady stream to drip into the bowl.
 When he had enough, he jerked his arm free.
“That’s it.” He said. 
The bowl was just half full.
“Your gift is humbling, but if that is it… don’t expect much,” Elrahet grumbled.
“I did say that we can do this without you.”
Elrahet scowled, then took the bowl and began to flick Ayram’s blood onto the lizard’s corpse, careful to make sure that not a drop hit the dirt.
Ayram took the yard of linen to dress his wound. As he tried to maneuver his hips round so he could leave, he bumped Elrahet. 
“Get out of here!” she snapped. 
Ayram laughed as he did.

Maybe do short desc. Of the ravine here.

The first signs of Elrahet’s magic were the wispy vapor trails that circulated high in the atmosphere above her cave. They twirled and danced, driven by unnatural purpose, though they were so slight that they could hardly be said to be there at all. By the time Ayram sat down at his hiding spot behind a couple of small boulders on the northern slope of the ravine, the trails had begun to congeal into something thicker.
Soon the wind picked up and began to brush them into form, and it blew a pleasant musk of earthy, humid air down into the ravine. If Ayram had not been looking for it, he might not have noticed how a light fog subtly shifting into existence. Just as he began to wonder if the crew had taken notice, a low rolling drum of distant thunder echoed through the valley, though there was, as yet, no great storm from which it could have come.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papillian excitedly. The boy was stationed behind a boulder closer to the road. Ayram glared down at him with sufficient sternness to shush him. He didn’t blame the lad for the outburst as this was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of magic.
It was perhaps too good. The merchant caravan was still far out. Perhaps they had not yet made it into the valley’s fingers. Perhaps they could see the cyclonic flow of haze that now swirled above Elrahet’s cave. Still, Ayram half expected that it all might fizzle out - humans made for poor magicians - but all his doubts were allayed when dense clouds began to creep out from some invisible fissure in the sky.
They crept out slowly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. Once they were out over the ravine they began to feed, to chew and swallow the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the lizard that Elrahet had prepared. 
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, just little pricklings on the skin, just a light peppering of the sandy rocks and clay. The drizzle cleansed the air of the desert dust that was ever present in the Sand, the stuff that clogged the nose and scratched the throat. In fact the air was so crisp that this was the first time in forever that Ayram could take in a full, clean breath. It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.
More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Ayram found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all.  
At least the earth seemed to enjoy it, parched and desiccated as it was. It took its time to drink its fill. It filtered the water through sand and silt and then trickled it down into the deep reservoirs of the world. It savoured every drop, and it drank slowly, which meant that it did not take long for the surface to become soaked. Soon rain began to pitter-patter into puddles, and water ran down the ravine, seeking out the familiar routes that it had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millenia. Where once there were cracks, pits, and sinks in the rock and clay, there were now streams and cascades. Where once there were depressions and scars, there were now pools in which desert life would find succor.
Ayram looked over to the young Papillian. Though the rain was rare and precious on this side of the Junei Mountains, the boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers. He might as well have been swimming. 
He muttered a curse, and the storm cursed back.


CRACK-BOOM!


A bright and gnarled flash of lightning split the dark sky above. 
It hit somewhere near in the cliffs behind them.
Everyone jumped.
“Elra’s never conjured more than foggy mist!” Papillian exclaimed.
Colm, a beastly man to Papillian’s side could be heard as well. “Bit much innit?”
Ayram disagreed.  By this point the valley road was getting good and slick and muddy. Laden wagons would have to be dragged through it. They would be moving slowly, if they would move at all - though that was cause for some concern. They might not even make it into the ravine. Or, they might have turned around and fled the valley as soon as the first showers hit them.
 Then a faint horse’s whinny pierced the splashing of the rain. 
Ayram turned his gaze southward. There he could just make out the shapes of white horses coming round the bend. Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Ayram could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.
Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Ayram expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.
Ayram would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn’t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers’ turbans. They were each, to a man, Roman[a]. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.
Ayram's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Ayram felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.
By the time the middle of column had reached Ayram’s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.
 The dead rider’s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 
So began the battle.
Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Ayram had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. 
Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.
 An officer’s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Ayram. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. 
They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.
Ayram eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party’s arrows from whittling them down one by one.
Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his hands began to glow.
Ayram notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. 
Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. 


CRACK-BOOM!


A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Ayram back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. 
Then things went black.
        
_______


        Getting your skull caved in is the worst way to lose track of time. Next worst is a night of fitful sleep, but of course that doesn’t compare. Sleep can be said to be a lived experience inasmuch as one’s dreams are remembered.  Even without them, the passage of time is always somehow estimated so that as soon as you step out of bed there is that sublime sensation of being reinserted into the natural flow of things - not so with a knockout blow.
More to the point, there’s the pain.
        When Ayram came to, there was a dull, throbbing ache that radiated out from the top of his head where the rock had cracked open his skull. He brought his hand up to the wound and dabbed it gingerly with his fingers. They trembled upon a smattering of dried blood which had matted his hair. He then continued to follow the pain to its source, near the crown of his skull. There he found that he could push down on a flap of skin and a cracked bit of bone. As he traced the outline of the cavity, a sharp pain shot out and ran around to the back of his head, constricting his skull like a python. 
        He must have been out for hours. Maybe days. He had no way of knowing 
Oddly, it was still raining.
        “You’re awake!”
        It was old Elrahet. She rushed to his side.
        “We were set up!” she said.
        “What?” Ayram asked, confused even as to how he was alive.
“It was a setup! There was no gold!” Her raspy voice was quivering with excitement and rage.
Ayram tried to blink the blur out of his vision. He was in a cave somewhere high in the mountains.
“How long was I out?”, he asked.
“For the better part of a day… There was no gold, Ayram.” 
Ayram winced, half in pain, half in exasperation.
“What happened?” he asked.
“That storm that Elrahet magic’d up conjured a bolt… bigger than any I’ve ever seen... it took out the entire caravan. It took out Papillian and Colm, too, and nearly you. But that magus survived!” Elrahet pointed to the naked figure who lay crumpled and unconscious near the cave’s mouth. His pale body was covered in black glyphs and arcane symbols. Blood pooled around him.
“He has not yet awoken. I haven’t told the boys yet, but he’s no mere magus. We cut
off his hands… I think he’s one of the Emperor’s Salisians,” Elrahet said. “Only four Salisians in the world, and one of them is here... He was here to kill us! Ayram, we were set up!”
Ayram struggled to take it all in.
“Who was your man in Jeket?!” Elrahet asked, stressing the urgency of the moment. 
“Who baited us into this?”
Ayram closed his eyes and gritted his teeth.
“A man named Salavan Saran.”

            <Text>
Mandri tried fighting, he tried running away, he even tried dying - none of it worked. No matter what he did, he couldn’t get away from well-adjusted people. Now here he was, shouldering a knobby sack of stuff that wasn’t his on a forsaken road some inestimable distance away from civilization, and there was Moto Mundi, striding alongside him. And Moto wasn’t just a well-adjusted person, he was good-and-well-adjusted. There’s a difference. It’s worse.
All the other Ayramun were oddballs. Moto’s sister, Moteah, was well-adjusted too, but Mandri liked to look at her so he gave her a pass. So in effect there was just one person amongst the thirteen Ayramun that Mandri knew he wouldn’t like. There was a decent chance Mandri he wouldn’t like any of the Ayramun once he got to know them, but Moto, that was a man that Mandri could hate on principle. That principle being, of course, that well-adjusted people are assholes.
The signs were there on the surface, with Moto’s flawless black skin, his clean and even features, his chiseled jaw, his height, his broad shoulders, his bird-bright eyes looking at the world like it’s just a game. Even when standing still he was dynamic, a slight swerve of coiled strength like the muscled statues of Zos - firmly fixed in granite yet about to burst into action. And is garb was disgustingly fashionable, tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. The dress was an affront to the struggle for survival out in the desert. Everyone else was done up in rags by comparison (excepting Moteah). Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. 
The sum of the effort put into his appearance might lead one to believe that Moto cared what other people thought of him, and if that were the case Mandri might have been able to stand him. No, Moto was well-adjusted, and well-adjusted people don’t really consider others to be sentient beings - that’s what makes them well-adjusted. If you take other people’s feelings into consideration, or how they might be judging you, well that leads to doubt, and that leads to indecision, and snip-snap it becomes a habit, leaving one anxious, uneasy, and more to the point, having to adjust themselves. As far as Mandri was concerned, that’s where empathy leads, it leads to a vicious, unceasing cycle of adjustment and so a well-adjusted person, by definition, lacks empathy, meaning they’re all assholes. So, Moto looked the way he did for no other reason than because it pleased him, and that made him an asshole. Well, it didn’t make him an asshole - it was a sign. Most people who look so pretty are only pretending to be well-adjusted. Mandri knew Moto was the real thing because of how he laughed.
The two were walking side by side and Mandri said out loud that he wondered where they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. Mandri didn’t see any road, so he asked, “What road?”, and then Moto laughed.
Laughs come in infinite flavors so they can be hard to place. This laugh was one that Mandri had a special sensitivity to. It was the laugh of someone who’s well-adjusted laughing at someone who’s not. It comes with a twinge of disbelief. There’s a note of derision. Not necessarily loud, it’s a simple, lively, full-bodied, challenging,“Hah!” that leaves a bitter afterthought. Mandri would have preferred Moto to just say you’re-out-of-place and be done with it.
Moto then turned that twinge of disbelief into a question. “You’re saying you don’t know about charnel roads?” 
Mandri didn’t answer. He kept his eyes down, hoping the Moto might go silent as well.
“This is the Bazul Road,” Moto said.
Mandri only saw dirt. He looked forward, left and right, and there was more dirt. Yes, roads were made of dirt, but they had sides to them, or at least a waystone, or wheelruts - some sign of a thing passing through. Even lizard trails through shrubby brush carved clearly defined paths where green things didn’t grow. There was none of that here. You had step over the little grey shrubs, you had to walk around sunken pits of clay. The only thing that suggested a road were the tracks of the Ayramun who were walking ahead of him.
“I don’t see it,” Mandri said.
“Of course you don’t see it,” Moto answered. “You don’t know what to look for. But it’s here. The whole Sand is webbed by charnel roads just like this one.” Moto kicked the ground, as if doing so made the road’s existence more believable. Mandri began to wonder if Moto was trying to put him up and make him look a fool.
“They’re ancient things,” Moto said. “Let me ask you, if you had to build a road in a rainy place, how would you build it?
“What do you mean by ‘a rainy place’?”
“Used to rain here when this road was built.”
“How long ago was that?”
“Just answer the question. If you had to build a road in a rainy place, how would you build it?”
“I guess I don’t know.”
Moto clicked his tongue in disgust. “If I ask you a question at least try to answer it.”
“I really don’t know.”
“‘I don’t know. I don’t know.’Give it some thought. Think. Do you a think?”
“Of course I think.”
“Then look like it, cause you look dumb. You looking like it hurts to think.”
Mandri shrugged.
“I told you everything you need to know to be able to see the road, so look for the road.”
Mandri saw the road almost immediately but didn’t want to give Moto the satisfaction of having shown him something, so the two walked on in silence for a finger as Mandri pretended to look for a clue. But it was there, the Bazul Road. It was the gentlest raised hump of earth and it snaked on ahead into the distance; a slope so slight and obscured by brush that it was easy to miss, and it was wide, at least twelve men across, so wide that it was easy to mistake for a natural deposit of dirt blown in from one of the Hazisads, one of the sandstorms which the heat whips up in the summer and spins aimlessly in the Sand for weeks. Mandri thought that a natural explanation like a storm was a much more reasonable explanation for this ‘road’. It was just too big, and went on too far. More likely it was the result of some tectonic shift of rock than mere men slaving away. 
Mandri wasn’t about to voice his opinion, though. Instead he furrowed his brow, looked at nothing in particular, scratched his chin and took as much pleasure as he could in the mild anticipation building in Moto’s stare before finally shrugging and saying, “I don’t see it.”
The tall Zosan recoiled in shock.
“Are you dumb?” Moto asked.
The bluntness of it made Mandri laugh. That tapered off when as soon as Mandri realized that Moto was serious. The man really thought he was dumb.
“I’m not dumb. I just don’t - what does it matter whether or not I can see the road? Is this some kind of test?”
“It wasn’t before, but now it is.”
“Well what does it matter?”
“A man needs to know if his traveling companion is dumb.”
“Why?”
Moto sighed in frustration. 
“Let me start on a different foot here, Mandri: I don’t care about you at all. Ayram has saddled me with the burden of getting to know you, and so here I am.”
“I’m sorry to hear that.”
“You want to know where we’re going? We’re going to a place called Minting Rock. It’s off the road a few leagues north of here. And the road is here. You see its this hump here.” Moto traced the contour with an open hand. “They made it a hump so that water rolls off it. there’s even gutters on the sides if you dig down there. You see there between those hills, that little sump there? The slope that runs between them? Follow that all the way down -“”	“So you say.”
“You don’t believe me?”
“No, I believe you.”
Moto smiled. “It goes further than you’d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?”
“I don’t.”
“Don’t suppose you can figure out why they call them charnel roads?”
“I don’t know what charnel means.”	“Means of place of death.”
“Then I guess it means things die on these roads.”
“You guess?”
“It’s just a figure of speech.”
 “You know the sun can kill you, right?”
“Yeah. But-”
“But what?”
“Can’t people just walk the roads at night?”
Moto raised his arms to the sun revelation, as if a long-awaited answer to a prayer had finally come. He smiled and shouted, “The boy thinks!” A mocking gleam shone out from under his imposing brow, and he said Mandri, “I shall thank Sol that you are not well-and-truly dumb.”
“Oh, so I’m just regular-old-dumb then?”
“That remains to be seen. But what you undeniably are is ignorant.”
“It was an honest question.”
“It was! It is. But you see, it’s not any old thing that dies on a charnel road. It’s pilgrims that die. And as anyone who’s ever spent any time in the Sand knows, pilgrims don’t walk the roads at night because the whole point of walking the road is to suffer.”
“I thought it was to get to where you’re going.”
“See, you’ve never met a pilgrim.”
“Pilgrims don’t go to Meskalem.”
“Ask a pilgrim why he doesn’t make the Bazul Road at night and he’ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn’t have been martyred out in the Sand.”
“I see.”
“If Bazul wanted a pilgrim to lead a life of comfort, then he’d have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. But oh, no! No, no, no! Bazul’s shrine is set deep into the Sand because Bazul deemed it fit to be killed there.”
“Ah,” Mandri muttered. 
It was an indifferent ‘ah’. If Moto were a normal person, an utterance like that would get him to clam up. Not the well-adjusted. Mandri might as well have been a bush rustling its branches. Moto just kept on going.
“Walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. So true Solitant pilgrims don’t trivialize the road by walking it at night. No, no. They trudge along the road in the blaze of day, and sometimes they die doing it.”
“Tragic.”
“Show some respect, boy.”
“Sorry. I’m sorry. I’m just having a hard time. In general I mean. And this damned pack. Heavy as a kumkwat. It’s put me in a mood.”
“You’ve never journeyed outside of Meskalem, have you?”
“Not until recently, no.”
“What are you doing out here in the wilderness if you’ve got no experience with it?”
“You tell me. You guys are the ones who raised me from the dead.”
“I mean before all that. We found you found you murdered in a ravine in the Junei. How did that come to happen?”
“I’d rather not talk about it.”
“I’d like for you to talk about it.”
“Well, I don’t want to.”
“That’s unfortunate, because you’re going to.”
“Is that so?”
“ I’m going to need an answer. What were you doing dead in that ravine?”
“Can I ask a question first?”
“No.”
“Why not?”
“Because.”
“Well why not?”
“I don’t need to give you a reason, just do what you’re asked.”
“Why can’t we have a normal conversation? You ask a question, then I ask a question. Talk about the weather. Why you got to be all, ‘I’m in charge here, I do the asking’?”
 Moto stops walking. Folds his arm. Looks Mandri up and down like he’s seeing a djinn. Mandri felt compelled to stop walking too, like he was tethered to mandri’s stare.
“Mandri, I’ll warn you now and warn you once - there is no place in Ayram’s graces for a scrawny boy who won’t do what he’s asked. I do what Ayram asks me to do. Ayram asks me to find out what you were up to in that ravine, so I am here trying to find out. So you tell me that, and we can get along. ”
“I’ll make deal.”
“Oh?”
“You’re a strong guy. I’m weak. If you carry this sack for me, I’ll tell you anything you want to know.”
Moto shifted his weight forward.
“I get the sense that you haven’t quite grasped the situation here.”
“I don’t. That’s why I want to ask some questions, but you won’t let me. I don’t even know where I am.”
“Where you are is at the end of my patience, and if you need to ask a couple questions to figure that out then you aren’t going to last long out here. We left the last boy who got lippy half buried in a mudpan down in Kokuma.”
“Scary.”
Moto’s hand flicked up then slapped the impertinence out of Mandri’s cheek.

THWACK

 Mandri didn’t see it coming. He was looking right at the man, but didn’t see it coming. Moto was shaking the sting out of his fingers by the time Mandri realized his jaw felt like a wallop. 
An arresting threat in Moto’s eyes rooted Mandri to the spot. 
“You don’t belong out here Mandri. You’re gonna need adjustment.”
 
Adjustment.

What a word to use, adjustment. Moto could have said one of twenty words that mean roughly the same thing, but he didn’t. He could have told Mandri that he ‘needed improvement’, and likely the two would have gone on to trade insults all the way to Minting Rock. The slap, all that did was sting. The sound of the word adjustment whistling out from under Moto’s pampered mustache, well that ripped the lining right out of Mandri’s mind.
Funny how a word could do that, revert a budding man into a child - not even a child, in that moment Mandri was a sense organ, a bundle of light and sound and confusion incapable of comprehending what it was and what was happening to it.  And it wasn’t just the word that did all this, it was the lifetime of indignities that had glommed onto it, a veritable wrecking ball, one his father had been forging for years, ever since the first time he’d caught Mandri’s wrist and told him to stop acting like a fag.
All this, it was a hindrance to living. So, for the second time in as many weeks, Mandri decided to simply stop. He unshouldered his pack, let it hit the ground with a thud, and marched off. 
Moto, ignorant of the explosion he’d just caused, saw saw only disrespect.
“Don’t walk away from me!”
Mandri didn’t answer.
“Actually, you know what, keep walking! Let the sun do the work.”
Mandri only got a few steps away when Moto decided to set out after him. He hadn’t yet learned who’d killed the boy.
“Careful where you step, Mandri. Don’t step right next to a rock that big or you’ll end up with fangs in your ankle.”
Mandri wasn’t even looking at the ground.
Moto put his hand on Mandri’s shoulder. Mandri shrugged it off. There was an energy in his body that Moto felt, and that was something Moto recognized. Electric twitch of an animal, or a man, ready to fight for it’s life.
“You’re gonna die out here.”
“Done it before.”
“But you ain’t just gonna die. This is a charnel road, and you’ve plumped up with water.”
Step step step.	“It could be days before you end up dead. That’s not a good death.”
Step. Step. Step.
“You ever seen what the sun can do to a person? There’s no karkle bushes here for you to hide under. Imagine rubbing your eyes with no moisture in them. Imagine an ache that splits you from your head to your toes, peels open your stomach, gnaws at the marrow in your bones like a fever. All the while your mouth is turning black, drying out, and your tongue swells up to bursting.”
Mandri is getting rigged.
“You ever seen a black tongue the size of a hermit slug?”
“Holy hell, shut up!”	“I haven’t even got to the worst of it. There’s an old pile of pilgrim’s bones not far from here that I could show you. And when you look at those bones you’ll see they’re scattered about and he’s missing a few limbs. That’s because lizards got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you’ll still be alive when they do it.”
“I get it.”
“Ha! I do not think that you do.”
Moto leans in. 
“They just start chewing. A drag-belly’s venom stings worse than fire, and the way it works is they chew the venom into you. They got about a hundred teeth the size of arrowheads . That knife wound there in your chest, it’ll be that pain times a hundred. Times a thousand for the venom. Times twenty more cause a pack of drag-bellies numbers at least twenty. And that’s when you learn how smart a drag-belly can be, because they won’t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible. Keeps the meat fresh. ”
Mandri laying there in a gutter. Gutter used in ancient days to stop the dregs from getting their carts on the road without paying the tolls.
Moto face broke into a smile. 
“I know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking you can just kill yourself before any of that happens. But you’re not thinking, thinking. You need to remember what I said earlier about leaving a boy half-buried in a mudpan. Ask yourself why this man named Moto would do a thing like that.”
Moto stood up straight and waited for Mandri to give an answer. It wasn’t a full-wait, it was a half-wait, a token gesture to suggest this was a conversation. As soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead.
“You want a hint? You look like you need a hint. I mean, it’s simple, really. I’ll just tell you. It’s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can’t bash his own brains in. Make the mistake of tying a man’s hands and legs and nothing else, and you know what he’ll do when he gets bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He’ll get on his knees like a groveling postulant, then he’ll bend back, face to the heavens like he’s rapt in prayer - that’s what I thought he was doing - and then he’ll swing forward and smash his head against a rock.”
As Moto said all this, he imitated the action, headbutting the air. 
The jerky movement drew the eye of one of the Ayramun who was walking on down the road. It was Sob.
Sob called out, “Hey Moto!”
Moto twisted around to see Sob and Chopper walking there where he and Mandri had been a moment ago. Sob looked winded. Chopper looked like a pack animal, the bulk of leather and cloth on his back incongruous atop his skinny legs.
Sob shouted, “Ya’ll takin a shit, or what?”
Moto shouted back, “Hey Sob, you got any rope?”
Sob’s bald head gleamed no, but Chopper reached into the amorphous blob of pack on his back and pulled out a length of coiled rope. He held it up against the blue sky.
“Bring it over!” Moto shouted.
Sob upset with Chopper for showing the rope.
Sob said something to Chopper, and the two came running over. When they arrived and saw Mandri lying down in a ditch, Sob laughed.
“What, the boy needs help to pop a squat?”
“Chop?”
“No chop. no chop,” Moto said. “Sob, gimme the rope.”
“What you need the rope for?”
“Mandri here wants to get eaten by lizards.”
“What?”
“Don’t worry about it, just gimme the rope.”
Sob pulled the rope away from Moto’s outstretched hand. He coddled it close to his chest like it was a work of holy scripture.
He asked again, “What you need it for?”
“I want to tie Mandri up to make sure he gets the full experience.”
Sob looked from Moto to Mandri with concern. Mandri thought that concern was for him, but that was dashed as soon as Sob opened his mouth.
“I only just made this rope!”
“Give it here,” said Moto.
“Oh, come on. I been at this thing since we left Urun.”
“Give it here.”
“Use your own rope.”
“I don’t have any.”
“And why is that, huh? Cuz you a lazy, rotten,thieving mooch!  You are overripe, Moto! That’s why!”
“Settle down, Sob. You’ll get it back.”
“I’ll get - I’ll get - I’ll get!” Sob stammered  those words in disbelief. He raised the rope in his clenched fist, knuckles white, and shouted, “You already owe me forty feet!”
“Shut up. Give me the rope.”
Telling Sob to shut up was the surest way to get him riled up, and Moto knew it. Sob knew that Moto knew it. and that made it so much more unbearable. He also knew he couldn’t do anything about it. He had to give him the rope, because Moto’s left hand was resting oh-so-casually on the pommel of his sword. 
Moto saw Sob’s eyes flick to the sword on his hip.
“Please, Sob. We both know I wouldn’t need a weapon to get you to give me that rope.”
Mandri watched as Sob 
With a huff, Sob handed the rope over.
“I’m gonna tell Ayram about this.”
“Be sure that you do.”
“Oh, I will.”
“And tell him where we are. We’ll be here. Might be at one of the lizard pits back by that elbow we just passed.”
With that Sob stomped off in a storm to rival the . Sob casts a ‘lucky’ stone aside.

Moto turned to Chopper.
Chopper asked, “Chop?”
“No chop. Hold the boy still.”


Little bit about pain poking through that frustration.
“Alright. I’ll tell you what you want to know.”
“I haven’t started yet.”
“Just go away.”
“What part of anything I’ve said suggests that I’m going to do that? Why even ask? Think, Mandri, think. Tell me who killed you and why.”
“I said I’ll tell you.”
“Alright then.”
“Can you at least get Chopper’s breath out my face?”
“Chopper, give him some space.”
Chopper backs off.
“So who killed you?”
“I killed me.”
The look of complete disbelief on Moto’s face.
“It’s the truth. I killed myself. I went out into the Junei because I wanted to die.”
“If you killed yourself, then where was the blade?”
“I threw it.”
“You stabbed yourself in the chest, pierced your heart, and then you threw the blade away?”
“Yes.”
Moto look at mandri like he’d seen him for the first time.
“Why’d you do that?”
“Do I need a reason?”
“Were you running from someone?”
“No one in particular.”
“The hell does that mean? You have debts?”
“No. Look, it doesn’t matter. I told you what you want to know.”
“You have done no such thing. I want to know who the hell you are. I want to know precisely why you were out there in the Junei, and I want to know what brought you to kill yourself - if that is indeed what happened.”
“My name is Mandrameen. I was in the Junei because I wanted to die, and I wanted to die because...”
“Yes?”
Mandri fought it impossible to say out loud. There’d be no point. Communication.
“Boy. Out with it. What are you, one of those sad saps who can’t get loving?”
“Something like that.”
“Something like it? Or is that it?”
“I don’t know.”
“Was it a girl?”
“No.”
“Hah! Boy your age gets upset, it’s always a girl.”
“It wasn’t a girl.”
“Sure.”
Mandri shrugged. “Believe what you want.”
“Mandri, a man’s got to have a reason to be sad. See, Chopper gets here sad when you don’t let him chop.”
Chopper, who had been waiting patiently this whole time, perked up at the mention of his favorite word. It reminded him of something - maybe someone needed some chopping. He knew the answer was no, but decided to ask anyways.
“Chop?”
Moto spared a glance for Chopper and said, “No chop.”
Chopper’s heart sank.
“You see?” Moto said, pointing to Chopper with an open hand. “Sadness is cause and effect, like everything else.”
“Why do you care?”
“Again, Mandri, I don’t care. I don’t care about you at all. It is Ayram that cares. He’s going to want to know all about you.”
“Why?”
“So that he can know what to do with you.”
“Gods, just leave me here.”
Moto stood up to his full height.
“Just leave you here, huh? You sound…You sound…” Moto swirled the air with his hand as searched for the right word.
“Jilted. Yes, that’s the right word. Yes. Look at you. A young man, a jilted lover-”
“I’m not a-”
“No doubt born into wealth. I mean look at your frame. You wouldn’t survive in the streets of Meskalem. No, you were a coddled child who didn’t have enough problems to solve and so he made up his own. And that’s it! That’s what’s wrong with you.”
Moto, pleased with himself.
“You suffer from a lack of practical problems. And what luck, here I am!”
“You see, Mandri, I was just like you once, a young man, a jilted lover, mind stuck in the muds of ennui. There is no more fitting person in all the world to cure you of your affliction.”
Moto motions to Chopper. That didn’t get his attention, so he resorted to calling the name.
“Chopper - ”
“Chop?”
“No chop. I want you hold the boy down.”
Chopper holds mandri down.
“Wait! Wait a hair. You said you were going to let me go.”
“When did I say that?”
That got a growl out of Mandri.
“Settle down, boy. This is for your own good.”
“Get your damned hands off me!”
Moto wraps Mandri up. Stuffs a cloth in his mouth.
“If you spit that out, I’m going to have Chopper here take your balls. Got it? Nod if you got it.”
Chopper heard his name said and Mandri was like shit.
He nodded.
“Alright. We’ve got to walk a little ways.”
Went off back the way they had come.
“So , Mandri. Mandri, Mandri, Mandri. Mandrameen. Mandram-een.” Kept saying the name until it became foreign even to Mandri.
“The thing that you need to know... The thing you need to understand is that humans weren’t made to do anything other than solve practical problems. 
Still sad. 
Don’t feel like fight for yourself, huh? Just giving up?
I am.

Take him to lizard pit.
Throws him in
Now that’s a problem. There’s no room in the Ayramun for people who can’t defend themselves.
Well that’s fine. I don’t want to be in the Ayramun.
More scared of you than you are of it.
Scream
Maybe not.
Chop?
Give him a sword.

Its to get the blood out.

I don’t trust a man who has thought of killing himself. Shows he’s sane.



You gotta move fast - but do it slowly
What!?
Don’t let it sense your fear. They get riled up if they do.

            <Notes>Mandri marched on.  Deliberate step after step, heel crushing dirt, then bursting a bloated hornscrub - that hurt but it didn’t matter. Nothing mattered.
This gets to the heart of the Solitant religion which believes that all creatures are naturally immortal, but they kill themselves with every bad decision. Every uncouth mistake ages the soul, every missed opportunity for righteousness draws another line in the face. If only people made the right decisions at every step they would live forever as a child, but we’re all too ignorant, too dumb, and too lazy. Sol’s light reveals the weight of our failures literally kills us. </Notes>

TOGETHER
BY NORMAN DOUGLAS

Through the silvery curtain of drizzle I glance{5} eastwards and recognize the old, old view,  

 I was lifted out of bed and placed on the window-sill to behold a wondrous thing—the sky all a-glister with livid rays. 

What is one to do with people, future candidates for government posts, who cannot tell the difference between an adverb and a conjunction, who, if you ask them to define a reflexive verb, gaze at you with an air of injured innocence, almost as if you had asked them to say what is the capital of China, the position of their own colony of Obok, and whether Chili belongs to Germany or to Austria? They learn none of these things at school; or if they do, it is in some infant class where they are forgotten again, promptly and forever. Instead of this, they are crammed with microscopic details, under the name of “Littérature,” concerning the lives of all French writers that ever breathed the air of Heaven, and with a bewildering mass of worthless physical formulæ, enough to daze the brain of a Gauss. What Mr. R.{15} does not know about convex lenses and declination needles and such-like balderdash is not worth knowing; his acquaintance with every aspect of Molière’s life and works is devastating in its completeness, and makes me feel positively uncomfortable. Now Molière was doubtless a fine fellow, but no youngster has any right to know so much about him. I only wish they had taught him a few elements of grammar instead 
It is too late now. He laughs at grammar—a frank, derisory laugh. In other words, my task is rendered none the easier by his serene self-confidence. He does not share my view that his English is still rudimentary, though he admits that it may require “a little polish here and there.” 

covered with fresh snow wherever snow can come to lie among its crags.  

At last my father could bear it no longer and slunk out of the house one afternoon on his usual pretext—when anything risky had to be done—of going after chamois. He rolled himself in his blanket at{23} the Sarotla alp, near the foot of the peak, and next day, somehow or other, set foot on the virgin summit. Imagine his disgust on finding there a Steinmandl, a cairn, containing a bottle with an affectionate letter to himself from “Bühel-Toni” who had sneaked up ages ago, all by himself, without saying a word to any one. 

 insisted on “doing” the Zimba once a year. It was a sporting notion; the Zimba did him, in the end; he lies buried in the new Protestant cemetery at Bludenz. 

Cleverest of all was the gentleman who lately achieved the distinction of dying from exposure on the Hoher Frassen. He ought to have left us word to say how the thing was done. 


he may well have been the image of his father since, from all I have heard, he had the same character and therefore, according to a theory of my own, must have resembled him also in person.  



The Brunnenmacher’s laughing face charmed away hunger and fatigue and wet clothes and all the ills of mountaineering. It may seem far-fetched to apply the terms “ingenuous” or “childlike” to the smile of a bearded monster of forty, but there are no other epithets available for{26} that of the Brunnenmacher. It rose to his lips, on seeing you; it hovered there day and night, waiting for your appearance. Doubtless he had a peculiar affection for me, as being my father’s son; everybody found him a lovable person. 

His weather-proof good humor must have helped to establish his reputation as a guide; that, and his jovial blasphemies. They made you laugh, and a guide who makes you laugh has already gone a long way towards gaining your friendship. Once you persuaded the Brunnenmacher to begin some story of his, which was not difficult, you were sure to get an adequate amount of playful bad language thrown in. An infallible method of getting more than this adequate amount was to make him relate his experiences of a trip to America, and of the agonies of four days’ sea-sickness on an empty stomach. This narrative bristled with swear words; it ended in a fixed formula: “Jo, Himmelherrgottsakraméntnochemol, do honni grod gmeint i müest ussm grosse Zähe uffi kotze!” which might as well be left untranslated ... 

The younger Brunnenmacher first took me there, and how he managed to hit upon the precise locality of this grotto remains a mystery to me.  

The curiosity of a man-made cave out in the wilderness.

 a spot where you could discover a certain vitriolic mineral by the simple process of applying your tongue to the rock;  

It appears that two, a man and a woman, come from the Walserthal, which has always been famous for its crop of imbeciles; the third was born at Raggal, likewise fertile mother of idiots, because everybody marries into his own family there. These Raggalers are such passionate agriculturalists and so busy, all the year round, with their fields and cattle, that they refuse to waste time scouring the province for so trivial an object as a wife with fresh blood, when you can get a colorable substitute at home. Our particular idiots live, all three of them, on the road to St. Anne church, in that workhouse which, so far as I know, has sheltered from time immemorial the poor of the district, the aged, the infirm of mind or body. There is always a fine assortment of wrecks on view here. Sisters of Charity look after them. 


Now of course you cannot have everything in this{39} world. You cannot ask, in a district otherwise so richly endowed by Nature as this one, for the fine fleur of imbecility—for crétins.   To see these marvels you must go further afield, to places like the Valtellina or Val d’Aosta (and even there, I understand, the race is losing some of its best characteristics. These doctors!) But one might at least have kept alive a specimen or two of the old school, just for memory’s sake; idiots such as my sister and myself used to see, while rambling as children about these streets with the Alte Anna, our nurse. On that very bench, where the modish lady was reclining to-day, or its predecessor, there used to sit two skinny old madwomen side by side, with their backs to the wall. There they sat, always in the same place. They were as mad as could be, and older than the hills. A terrifying spectacle—these two blank creatures, staring into vacuity out of pale blue eyes, with white hair tumbled all about their shoulders. One of them disappeared—died, no doubt; the survivor went on sitting and staring, in her old place. There was another idiot whom we liked far better; in fact we loved him. He was of the joyful and jabbering kind, and he lived near the factory. His facial contortions used to make us shriek with laughter. Sometimes he dribbled at the mouth. When he dribbled copiously, which was not every day, it was our crowning joy. 
The old Anna, of course, knew by heart every idiot within miles of our home. She specialized in such phenomena. What she liked even better was anything in the nature of an accident, operation, horrible disease, or childbirth; she knew of it, by some dark instinct, the moment it occurred: she knew! and, being forbidden to leave the children alone, dragged us with her into the remotest peasant-houses and hamlets to enjoy the sight. Above all things, she had a mania for corpses and the flair of a hyena for discovering their whereabouts. As often as there was a corpse within walking distance, she donned her seven-league boots and rushed towards it in the bee-line, carrying my sister, to save time, while I toddled painfully after. Arrived at the spot where the dead body lay, she would first cross herself and then begin to gloat. We did the same. Who knows how many maladies, how many corpses, we inspected at that tender age! A sound education. For it familiarized us with death and suffering at a life-period when one cannot yet grasp their full import; it took away, for good and all, a great part of their terrors. We were never shocked by such things; only interested—hugely interested.... 

simmering and bubbling with contentment as you recognize the old things in their old places! 

A short stroll late at night, down the main road towards Bludesch, in order to enjoy the scent of the fields....
I look up at my old home; it is brilliantly illuminated; three different families, they say, are at present living there. I should not care to enter that place again. Then we pass the doctor’s house on our left. I

An age to take walks to just enjoy being about. What is done to him?

nd during convalescence he told my mother that my pulse was placid like that of “an old cow,” which it still is. 

Now ever since a recent date which I forget, when the upper Rhine misbehaved itself so shockingly that the Austrian and Swiss Governments were forced to undertake some costly works with a view to ensuring better conduct in the future, our own two rivers, the Lutz and Ill, which were likewise subject to devastating floods, began to be hemmed in by stone embankments more systematically and more remorselessly than they had ever yet been in days of old, when they also gave an infinity of trouble. 

Gone are the garnets and grasshoppers; gone is the charm of those pallid wastes. The economist gains. The poet, as usual, looks on and counts his loss. 

exchanged confidences 





 interspersed with pine-trees whose trunks of rose and{59} silver, struggling to obtain the same amount of light, shoot up straight as lances; sunny clearings and stretches of meadowland where the cattle graze knee-deep in spring; an undergrowth of junipers and other shrubs just sufficient to diversify the scene and please the eye—never too dense: noiselessly one treads on that emerald moss! 

Sometimes, in dry weather, this rivulet is blocked and allowed to flow over the parched plain. My first memory of it dates from such an occasion. There were puddles in the stream-bed here and there, puddles full of trout; and a number of Italian workmen—we employed a good many Italians at the factories—were catching these trout with their hands{63} and eating them alive, as if they were apples.  

The paternal grandfather who built and worked them almost to the day of his death must have been{65} a man of uncommon grit. I know little about him. A mass of family documents full of the requisite information, as well as other papers interesting to myself, were lost in one of those accidents which occur to everybody now and then; a trunk was broken open on a journey, the clothes stolen and these letters and things scattered or thrown away by the thieves. Small comfort to receive insurance money for the clothes! I would have preferred the papers which are now lost for ever. 

His portrait in old age, engraved from a photograph on one of those shell-cameos which used to be fashionable, wears an air of clean-cut, thoughtful determination. They told me of his effective way with beggars. “Work!” he would say, whenever one of them turned up with his usual tale of misery. “Work! I also work.” The other, naturally enough, professed himself quite unable to find any work. Whereupon, to the beggar’s intense disgust, he promptly found it for him. These gentlemen learnt to avoid our house in his day. I also gathered that his favorite ode of Horace was “Integer vitæ.” That sounds characteristic. My own fancy leans towards the Lady of Antium....

Yet three out of five village taverns are closed—disastrous symptom, among so convivial a people. The depreciation of the currency.... There are men, respectable men, who have not tasted a drop of wine for the last year, which is a shameful state of affairs. Only factory hands and such-like can afford to pay the present price of 8000 kronen for half a liter. Less than that sum, namely 7000, was what our tailor gave for his two-storied house with a garden and field. We watched a pig-auction the other day (where else, but at Tiefis?). A young one, weighing about seventy pounds, went for 610,000 kronen. In olden days, they would have made you a present of him. 

The Engerlinge, the larvæ of the cockchafer, have been unusually active of late. This miserable worm which lives underground, gnawing away the roots, had hitherto been kept in its place by the moles. But during the war and afterwards moles were destroyed as never before, for the sake of their skins. A mole eats one and a half times its own weight every day; he prefers the Engerlinge to all other food. So the larvæ now thrive, because the war was responsible for the death of the moles. One result of the war, so far as this little economic byway is concerned. 

 Our village elders have done their best to face the mischief. They have decided that every land-owner must bring in a certain measure of cockchafers or deposit a certain sum of money;{111} whoever collects more than this stipulated measure, is paid extra out of the sum deposited by the others; whoever fails to come up to the standard, is fined in proportion. The provincial government has also forbidden the destruction of moles, and to-day’s paper, now lying before me, contains an eloquent article entitled “Spare the moles!”
It is too late. The village of Bratz (=pratum), for example, is so sorely tried by the plague of these larvæ that a rich peasant owning, let us say, six cows, will not be able to cut enough fodder to keep them alive through the winter; his crop of hay is too impoverished. What shall he do? He is in the dilemma of seeing a couple of his beasts perish from starvation, or of selling them at their present value, although fully aware that by the time spring comes round and fodder is again plentiful, he will not be able, with the same amount of money, to purchase even a quarter of a cow to eat his grass; so rapid is the depreciation of the currency.
In this and other matters the peasantry, the backbone of the province, is being systematically ruined. The blow was undeserved. They were dragged into this tragic farce through no fault of their own, and are now paying for the folly of others. True, they revenge themselves on the rich factory hands and bureaucrats; they charge fantastic prices for milk and other agricultural products. The others retaliate by{112} burning their hay-huts. There was a good deal of incendiarism in the Bludenz district last winter. Mutual ill-will is the result. And their so-called betters, the rentiers who, after a life of drudgery in office or elsewhere, laid aside sufficient money to build themselves a house wherein to end their days, are in still more pitiable plight. Such is the case of an old gentleman of my acquaintance at Bludenz, who had worked from the age of fourteen till after seventy, and had been able to acquire what seemed a considerable fortune. What are even a million kronen to-day? And how is he to earn more, at the age of eighty-six?

 Altogether, these children—a shadow seems to have passed over them, witnessing the distresses of their parents. They are paler than they used to be, and graver of mien; far too many are insufficiently clad and unshod. An Englishman might think ten shillings a reasonable price for a pair of sound children’s boots; the native cannot afford 110,000 kronen, a sum for which formerly he could have bought half a village. Even the post-boy, a lively youngster who happens to be a grandson of that old gardener of ours, presents himself up here every morning without shoes or stockings. He has none.{115}
I glance, for further informative matter, down the columns of that paper which bids us “Spare the moles!” and observe that it contains, among its advertisements, an offer by a furrier of two hundred kronen for each moleskin brought to him. This does not sound as if the provincial government’s decree were being enforced very drastically. The same gentleman is ready to pay exactly a thousand times as much for the skin of pine martens, which can be worth little enough at this warm season of the year. The animal is of the greatest scarcity in our neighborhood.[15]
They have anointed our boots with badger’s fat, in case we traverse any wet fields. We are only going along the main road towards Ludesch. That bench on the old Lutz embankment—that bench invariably occupied by a poor hump-backed woman reading—is sure to be empty at this hour. 

 There was once a battle on this site, a sanguinary battle between two rival gypsy bands who used it for their camping ground and accidentally arrived both on the same evening; each claimed it for his own, and several men were killed before the matter was decided; our people were talking about the fray years afterwards. Further on, past the bridge, I murdered the first snake of many and found my first piece of phosphorescent wood. Here, too, stands the rifle-range which is connected with one of six clear memories of my father; he used to come out of the place adorned with paper decorations for his marksmanship and they even hung up a framed diploma of honor to him; the building was sacked two years ago by some local revolutionaries who disapproved of shooting in every{117} form and carried off the diploma, but forgot to efface its mark on the wall where it had hung for fifty years. 

HAT was a monster of an ant-hill. It was the largest, by far the largest, I ever saw in this country, and the floor of the forest all around was twinkling with these priggish insects. Anxious to have some idea of its true size and anxious, at the same time, not to have any of the nuisances crawling up my own legs, I made Mr. R. pace its circumference. It took him sixteen good strides. And there they were, myriads upon myriads of them, hiving up for their own selfish purpose those dried fir-needles which, left alone, would have yielded a rich soil to future generations of men.
I have no use for ants, and cannot regard an ant-heap without yearning to stamp it flat (those made of earth are not difficult to treat in this fashion); without regretting that I lack the tongue and tastes of an anteater. And only in the tropics do you realize what a diabolical pest they may become with their orderly habits; European ants being mere amateurs in obnoxiousness. To do everything you are supposed to do, and nothing else at all; never to make a mistake, or, if you do, to be invariably punished for it{124} in exact proportion to the offense: can there be a more contemptible state of affairs? That is why, even as a boy, I used to foster the independent little fellows called myrmeleon (ant-lion) who built their artful, funnel-shaped traps in the dry sand out of reach of showers, just where our house-walls touched the ground; foster them, and visit them periodically, and feed them with these insufferable communists till they were ready to burst. But oh, to be an authentic anteater on a Gargantuan scale—omnipresent, insatiable of appetite—and engulf that entire tribe of automata!

Presently certain regions became famous for certain game; in that larch wood between Bürs and Bürserberg, for instance, which takes on such wonderful tints in autumn and which you can enter through a natural arch called the “Kuhloch,” you might count on crossbills and on a woodpecker of{127} one kind or another (never on the scarce black one; it haunts the gloomiest forests). Of the lesser spotted species I shot two off the same tree at an interval of almost exactly a year—30 December in one year, and 28 December the next; a circumstance all the more singular, as I never in my life met with another individual of this bird in the whole country. Or, if you wanted a great gray shrike, you had only to go, preferably in winter, to the Scesa-tobel, that devastated tract west of Bürs which was just then beginning to cover itself with vegetation once more. Here you might also put up a hare; it was in the Scesa-tobel, by the purest of accidents, that I once shot a hare in full gallop at a distance of a hundred yards—a mere speck, he was—with a bullet. I confessed afterwards to Mattli, who was beating another part of this torrent, that I had missed him at close quarters with the shot barrel, and soon regretted having made this confession; there are things one might well keep to oneself. 

Mattli never felt comfortable unless tracking birds; and his tales of how he shot a great white heron here and a bee-eater there, and something else somewhere else, were enough to make any one’s mouth water. He took me in hand, during those lean and hungry years; what the Brunnenmacher had done towards fostering my instincts for climbing, Mattli did for the more destructive ones; and a greater contrast was never seen than between these two early mentors of mine. The Brunnenmacher was short and fat and bearded and fair-haired and laughing, like many of them hereabouts; Mattli would have struck you at the first glance as something apart from his fellows, something primordial. He towered above the average height, he stooped from sheer tallness; the very scarecrow of a man, dusky, clean-shaven, sallow of complexion, with a harassed and hunted look in his eye and a voice that seemed to{129} come from caverns far away. A lonely, wolfish creature! I never saw him smile. His rarer birds he sold to Mr. Honstetter, the taxidermist of Bregenz, who doubtless disposed of them elsewhere and through whose hands passed nearly every curiosity—lämmergeier, eider duck, cormorant, griffon vulture and what not—which had been obtained in the province or even further afield. He once offered me the skull and horns of a genuine Swiss ibex, and a beaver stuffed by himself which had been killed on the Elbe on the 10 August, 1886; he wanted 175 Swiss francs for this last. The only thing I ever bought there was the skin of an ibis falcinellus shot at Hard on the Lake of Constance; it cost me two and a half florins.[16]


opened a fusillade of glances from his flashing black eyes, 

 it is the foul sooty shale called Algäu-Schiefer, perfidious and friable stuff, not to be called rock at all save in the geological sense of the word. 

for it yields to pressure and slides down, and this is where a chamois has the advantage over us. A man may scramble about honest crags like a fly on a wall, as securely as any chamois though not so fast; on precipices of the crumbling Algäu-Schiefer the animal leaps, and leaps again before the stuff has gathered momentum, and what shall man do? Avoid them, until he has acquired the capacity of bouncing like a chamois; in other words, like an indiarubber ball. 

 It soon struck me as being rather a steep gradient, and not only steep but ominously alive—ready to gallop downhill on a hint from myself; the mere weight of my body could set the whole mass in movement and hurl me along in a rocky flood. While making this sweet reflection I found, with dismay, that it was already too late to turn back; the least additional pressure on one foot might start the mischief; once started, nothing would arrest that deluge; its beginning, without a doubt, was going to be my end.
I was in for a ticklish business. Rush down the slope diagonally and evoke the landslide but anticipate its arrival? Even that was courting disaster. I preferred to remain in the upper regions and there{147} finished the long journey, with curious deliberation, on all fours, in order to distribute my weight; and then only by a miracle. It was one of those occasions on which one has ample leisure to look into the eye of death, and I now wish somebody could have taken a photograph of me—a colored one, by preference; one would like to possess a record of the exact tint of one’s complexion during half hours of this kind. Whoso, therefore, intends to traverse the same place would be well-advised to adopt my method of locomotion; the upright posture is not to be recommended. A pleasant farewell to all things! Never a button of you to be seen again; to be caught in a swirl, a deafening cataract of stones and, after snatching en passant a few grains of scientific comfort at the thought that your human interference had modified—if only temporarily—the angle of a talus, which is not everybody’s affair, to be buried alive at the bottom under an imposing heap of débris.
148

Was it downright bravura? That is not impossible! He had led an enchanted life among the rocks and ice, and a friend of his, an old gentleman whom I saw the other day in Bludenz and who was with him once or twice in the mountains, spoke to me of his contempt of danger; he said that while climbing he “seemed to tread on air” and could not be made to understand what people meant by giddiness. Or was he stalking some particular chamois? In that case the tragedy grows almost intelligible; there are{149} few things a man will not do under those circumstances.

            <Text>There’s nothing profound about terror—or any emotion for that matter, but Mandri thought terror was particularly superficial. Like love, or hate, it follows that same tired course that all the shallower emotions follow: first it startles him into stupidity, and then it spurs him into action, and all of this is forced. Reason is not allowed to have a say. When that beam of Mazydfire lit up the night, a stupefying terror took hold of him. Now, he was running through the dark bowels of the temple, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because that there wasn’t any time to light one up, even though it only took five god-damned seconds. As it goes with terror; reason is not allowed a say.
It wasn’t because he stubbed his toe that Mandrameen worked out of the terror faster than the others, it was because terror never lasted long in him in the first place. Consciously or not, he’d find a way to will it out, and this he did because in his bones he distrusted terror, just like he distrusted love or hate or any of those other emotions, and he distrusted them for the simple reason that it’s possible to feel two of them at once. If you can both love and hate a person, then that proves that there is a truer, deeper, reality there of which love and hate are but crude approximations.
And this isn’t a fault of language; it’s not the case that loving-and-hating is, in itself, a unique emotional state for which no one has come along and invented the right word. Mandri was sure that what was happening was, one moment there is a caring love, and in the next there is a spiteful hate, and the mind vacillates between the two, and seeing them pass by in quick succession makes absurdity of it all readily apparent. One cannot, with pigments black and white, paint a portrait in color. If Solraheen both calms and terrifies, well, the fault is not with Him.</Text>

            <Title>Retreat</Title>
            <Text>There were three people in Ayram’s backpack. Two were dead, naught but a tangle of limbs stuffed down in the bottom, an unseemly sight with their elbows, shoulders, wrists, and hips bulging the leather. Elrahet was the other. Her head was poking out, ancient but very much alive. She glared out at the rest of the Ayramun who lagged behind.
“Hurry up!” she barked. “This Riga boy won’t keep forever! Hurry it up!”
Ayram’s pace was furious. The going was rough. At the start it was easy, a simple, flat and winding wagon path, then Ayram scrambled off to the left, up a near vertical scree, and Mandri had a hard time following. At the top was a shelf of sturdy rock, and this fed into a tall, narrow canyon, the opening of which was an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders. The canyon walls were striated with chalky shades of red and orange, and it’s dramatic sweeping forms towered overhead to buttress a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he went along, though sunlight never touched the mushy pile of sand and fallen rock that was the floor. Instead the light bounced around the warm walls and made the air seem to glow.
This was not the same cursed rock that composed the Goree proper.
And Mandri might have savored the scene if he wasn’t having such a hard time keeping up with the blistering pace. Almost at once he was confronted with a fork in the canyon path, and as the Ayramun had charged ahead without a spare care for him, he was left behind to wonder which way everyone had gone.
His first instinct was to ask Obo. Obo would know.
His next instinct was to listen for the sounds of the Ayramun. Elrahet’s grumbling. Seb’s sloshing spit. Bickering when. But faint echoes are a difficult thing to judge when the paths before him curved away in indeterminable directions.
The reliable thing to do was to look for Ayram’s footprints. This was harder than it seemed because the sandy blend didn’t neatly preserve an impression. He managed because Ayram’s divots were unmistakably deeper than what was natural. Pleased with this little brilliance, Mandri marched on with some , but if he could figure it out, so too could any Hrkan trackers that were following behind.
Soon, Mandri found himself marching under the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin arc of sky above. As the day progressed, the canyon air warmed up, and unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off his skin the moment it beaded up. He marched on and on, and the longer he marched, the soggier his shirt and brow became. Few feelings are more uncomfortable than that of a soggy lower back under a heavy leather pack. That vortex of steamy air that emerges between the two is like a weather system unto itself, and this self-sustaining convection current, shaped by the contours of muscle and spine, is a living thing, a parasite more annoying than any mosquito because it can’t be swatted away. And he wouldn’t be rid of it until he threw off his pack, ripped of his shirt, and ragged himself dry.
He eventually got his chance when the way belled out into a short and wide shadow-striped valley. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because the canyon walls on either side had collapsed in the recent past. A mound of red rubble slouched in this valley’s belly, though a thin, passable trail had been carved right through it. Above the precarious eastern slope was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision, and above just that, the latter-day sun was casting shadows that stretched down to the floor. In them, the Ayramun were sitting, waiting for Mandrameen.
Moteah was the first to notice his coming.
“There he is,” she said, as if they’d been waiting for years.
“I told you he was right behind,” said Purl.
“That is stretching the meaning of ‘right behind’.”
Moto stood up, stretched his back, and said, “Time to go.”
Mandri pretended not to hear. If they had gotten a break, so would he.
Moto “If the Hrks have our trail, they won’t be far behind.”
Elrahet, still burrowed inside Ayram’s pack, said, “We’ll give the boy a moment.”
Mandri dumped that great weight off his shoulders, and it was like taking the lid off a steaming pot. The coolness that brushed his skin was glorious. He pulled off his tunic, and that, too, was glorious. He sat down a rock next to Purl, elbows on his knees, but sitting was not enough. He wanted to lay down, though with all the rubble, there wasn’t a good place for it. Then his eyes alighted on a veritable couch of a boulder, a smooth, sway-backed sandstone couch that he could melt onto. He stood up and made to climb up to it, and his first step up onto the eastern slope sent a trickle of sandstone crumbs tumbling down from above. 
Purl said, “What are you doing?” 
“I’m gonna lay down on that rock up there,” Mandri said.
“Stop.”
“I’m not going to nap or anything. I’m gonna to lay down for a moment.”
He took another step up, and then Ayram blurted out, “Heh! Down!”, as if he were giving commands to a dog.
Mandri relented. That blessed rock was not that high up, maybe only twenty feet or so. He could climb up and jump down without a fuss, so why shouldn’t he be allowed to do it? Because he’d be left behind? Because Ayram said so? 
That usurped his good sense, and rebellion swelled up in his chest. He turned to the Ayram, who was snacking on a ribbon of jerky, half of which stuck-out of his mouth and  waved at Mandri with every munch.
“Can I ask you something?” Mandri asked.
He didn’t wait for Ayram to finish chewing.
“Why do you care what I do with myself?”
Ayram’s thick brows jumped up in amazement. He snapped off his jerky, shoved the rest into his cheek, then said, “You want to climb up there and have a rest?”
“I do,” said Mandri. “But look, I won’t do it if you don’t want me to… it’s just that I never signed up for any of this.”
“You didn’t?”
“I’m not Ayramun... I mean, you’re a goddamned giant, so I’ll do what you want, but I’m not like, you know…” The immense indifference of Ayram’s stare broke Mandri’s  indignation, made him lose his train of thought. Mandri shuffled around for the right words, and when he couldn’t find them, he circled back around to where he started. “I mean, why do you care what I do? If I take a short rest and fall behind, then I fall behind, so what?”
A disrespectful smile flashed out from under Ayram’s bushy beard and he snorted a laugh, the kind of laugh that could start a school-yard fight. And he wasn’t the only one looking at Mandri like he’d lost his mind. Moteah’s was especially imperious, looking at Mandri like he was one of those smelly old men who do nothing but wallow in gutter and extol the richness of poverty, the joys of sorrow, the virtues of vice, and annoy everyone with visions of the end of the world.
“What’s so funny?” said Mandri. He was careful to say it in Seb’s direction.
Purl said, “Are you blind?”
“No,” said Mandri.
Purl pointed up at the eastern slope. “Then you must be dumb,” she said, “because there’s a demon right there.”
Mandri looked and saw nothing but a bunch of red rocks and that sway-backed block of sandstone. 
“What, are you talking about?”, he said.
“Okay, you are blind.”
Purl bent down, picked up a rock, then side-armed it up the eastern slope.  
Mandri spun around in time to see the rock smack into a boulder.
The boulder flinched and flashed it’s yellow fangs.
“OH, shit!”
The thing was right there—right there—squatting plain as day above the stone on which Mandri planned to rest. It was a hairless, red, lizard skinned demon that blended in so neatly with the sandstone that as it settled back into its imperious, statuesque pose, Mandri lost sight of it, though only for a moment, for when Mandri’s mind adjusted, the creature’s rock print pattern was betrayed by the organic forms of its corded muscle roping around its arms and legs, and these were human arms and legs, or rather, human-ish, for the proportions were all stretched out and it’s feet and hands were something else entirely. The feet were sharp-taloned and hawkish, and the fingers were curled and clawed like those of a long-lived pillow lizard. It’s face was a more compact admixture of the grotesque; the scrunched-up snout of a flat-faced pig, the nose and drooling flews of a hunting hound, and the outsized skull of a newborn babe,  scaled with lizardskin like everything else. Its eyes were yellow, snake-slitted, unblinking, and fixated on Mandrameen. 
Mandri looked to Ayram. “You’re not gonna kill it!?”
Ayram did nothing but laugh. 
Moto was a tight-lipped smiler with a dominant lower-lip, and sometimes, as now, that bottom lip pushed the smile into the realm of confusion; half-smile, half-frown, half-what-is-wrong-with-you?.
“It’s not worth the effort”, said Moto.
“But it’s a demon,” Mandri said.
“So? It’s not going sit there and let you kill it. It’s going to run away, and then you have to chase it.”
“It’s mostly harmless,” said Moteah. “Demons are flighty creatures. You’ll be fine as long as you don’t present yourself as meat.”
“So you sayin’ he ain’t gonna be fine,” Seb said t.
Mandri couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “What about those pilgrims on those poles?” he asked. “That thing needs to be put down.”
Ayram stood up, crossed his arms, and said, “You’ve got a sword. If you want it dead, go kill it.”
Mandri eyed the demon again. The damned thing was still staring at him.
“Well, uh… I’m not confident in my demon slaying abilities.”
That drew another turn of laughter. 
“Does that mean you’re ready to move along?”
“But it’s going to follow us.”
“It won’t do anything,” Ayram said. “That thing is as scared of me as you are of it. And it’s as dumb as a hammer.”
“It is?”
“Purl hit it with a rock and it still thinks that we can’t see it. You have eye contact with the damned thing, and it’s still thinks that you are looking at rocks.”
Ayram shook his head at the demon’s stupidity. Then he reached down, grabbed an Ayram-sized throwing stone and rolled the odd shape around in his hand until he found a good grip. Then he fixed his gaze on the demon, and like whip he , and he zipped that rock straight at that demon’s mouth.
SMACK
The rock exploded into fragments and dust.
The demon shrieked in surprise and then blood gargled pain as it tumbled back against the rocky slope. It tried to scramble upright, but Ayram’s stone had robbed it of it’s legs of confidence. It juddered and slipped and fell again. It’s face was such a bloody, broken mess, yet well-put-together considering the awful speed of Ayram’s stone. It didn’t take long for the demon to gather it’s bearings and scramble up the eastern slope on all fours, body low to the ground, leaping boulder to boulder. When it disappeared above the valley rim, Ayram bellowed out an exultant “Yih!”, and this sent another turn of chuckling through the Ayramun. 
The violence put an energy into Ayram. Rejuvinated. A man who means what says, , loosened him to. He waved a grand arm towards the boulder of Mandri’s desire. “Looks like your rock is safe now,” he said. “You can climb up there and lay down for as along as you like.” He said it as if it were a dare.
“I’ll follow you,” said Mandri.
“Following me counts as signing up to be Ayramun. And being Ayramun means you do what I say. You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“So, no backtalk… And that goes for you too, Seb.”
Seb scoffed at this sudden turn, 
“I don’t backtalk, I give suggestions.”
“Then no suggestions either! I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.
“So you understand me then?”
Mandri nodded.
“No, speak it.”
“I understand. I’ll follow you.”
“Good... But for now you’ll be following Moto.”
Moto perked up and asked, “Are you going to finish the demon off?”
“I’m going to scout for the Hrks,” said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, “and if I happen to smash a demon’s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.”
“Where you want to meet up?”
“If it’s like the Mayzd predicted and there’s no one in Shulgi, then we’ll meet in Shulgi. The highest columned cave. Otherwise… I don’t know… I’ll find you.”
With that, he grabbed his spud bar and leapt up the eastern slope, jumping from rock to rock with a flowing, dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.
His leaving left a silent void unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. She’d have to walk.
She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.
“Whose going to carry these two?” She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.
Moto smiled at Mandri. “Are you going to be joining us?”
“Yes.”
“Then it’s time you pulled your weight.”
Moto reached down into Ayram’s pack and pulled out Obo’s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri’s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could. Then Moto began to fish for the Riga.
“I’ll carry Obo,” said Mandri, “but I’m telling you, I cannot carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.”
Moto froze, looked Mandri square in the eye and said, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.” Moto’s avowed violence, clammed Mandri up, though it had the opposite effect on Moteah. She laughed, laughed bright and clear as if 
Moto’s eyes darted to her and his brow furled in rage. “You got something to say?”
“Oh come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig. He can’t carry all that.”
Moto’s jaw went tight. He stood up straight, straight as so that his could reach that air of authority, and he pointed a finger at Mandrameen, “If he’s not gonna carry the Riga,” the finger moved to Moteah,  “then you will carry the Riga.”
Moteah scoffed and settled into that incredulous hands-on-sidethrust-hip pose that drives angry men over the cliff, and not to be outskilled in art of finger-wagging, she pointed hers right back at Moto and said, “How about, for once, you take up the weight of responsibility when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a frilled lizard unfurling it’s threat display, he rolled back in his hips and  about whether or not pummel her.
Seb spat a wad of kackle? juice in between the siblings. “I’ll carry it,” he grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop barkin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damned thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“For Sol’s sake, lash it to my pack then.”
Seb unshouldered his pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto, unhappy with Seb’s act of charity, kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he pulled the Riga child up out of Ayram’s pack. A few wraps and knots of vinecord later, and the dead Riga was fixed in a harness to Seb’s pack. The Riga was completely, still swaddled in black, was unsettling sight when Seb walked, for the child’s head lolled from side to side as if it were merely asleep.
Seb bore his heavy pack with the stolidity of an ox, and he charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though his springy kick-step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the weight. Elrahet followed after him, and then Purl after her, and then Moteah brushed by her brother bearing a look of utter distaste. That left Mandri alone to with to deal with Moto’s shortened fuse. 
Stuffed as Mandri’s pack was, both of Obo’s forearms couldn’t fit, and with the drawstring tight around them, they stuck straight up into the air like a white rabbit’s ears. When Mandri got the pack settled on his shoulders, Obo’s limp-wristed hands flopped against the back of his head.
Moto stopped him from fixing the issue.
“Walk,” he said, and Mandri walked.

Need to inject ‘that damned bitch’. Earlier.

A stolid - supine- indifferent look.

Problem: that whole ‘I’ve survived ridiculous things. Dead five times over.”

This young man, like Mandri, was in the flower of his youth. He was renowned for his unwavering faith, even going so far as to sit at the . He was a perfect target for Enhedawadeen.
But wht of
Enhedawadeen sent forth a demon in the form of a whore to tempt Kasily to sin. This didn’t work, so he sent another, fair of hair and skin. She, too, failed to win a shameless victory. Enhedawadeen tried one last time, send a man. This demon, too, failed.
	Enhedawadeen raged in the depths of Shis. This chaste man, this , was concrete proof that the king of demons did not know mankind as well as . Did the urges not persist? Did he . Enhedawadeen had to no for sure. So, he sent another demon, this time in it’s natural, visceral form. It chased down Kasily and, wrestled to the point of exhaustion.
wind making a sweet whisper though the leaves of the trees, where they made him lie down on a feather bed, and left him there, tied down with soft silken bonds to prevent him escaping.
, fondling his manhood in her hands, in the hope of so inciting him to lust
Kisli, inspirited by the heavens, bit off his tongue and spat it in the temptress’ face. Torrent of blood, he drowned.
Some kind of flirting between mandri and purl.
Desert fathers story
Shameless victory over him. Bit down on his tongue.
Mandri wouldn’t have needed any temptress.

Love and lust being used interchangably. Which comes first, love or lust. Wholly separate things, but then comes a romantic relationship. Lovestruck? Is that different? Love isnt a distinctly human emotion. Humans are the only ones who trick themselves into thinking its something more than what it is. Open with love. Physical attraction. Wanted to paint her portrait.



Healing factor.
Interrogate mandri.
Lead into Obo suggesting a deal
Describe her priestess of mid.
We should kill him right now.
Use your brain you little shit. If he is some dark prophesy, then even if we kill him, he’ll just come back. Doesn’t matter what we do. If he’s not, then we’ll have killed hapless young man in his prime.
Ive already seen every inch of him, no curse.

Moteah asks Obo.
“What’s this act all about?”
“Moteah, stop.”
“Purl, be quiet.”
“Why pretend like you want to deal with us? What’s in it for you?”
“We Mazydai are practical creatures. We want what’s fair. I do something for you, you do something for me. What I do for you is, naturally, dependent on what you do for me.”
“Answer the goddamn question.”
“My point is that, whatever purpose you have for me, I’ll willingly do it, whatever it is, provided you do me a favor in return. So, tell me why I’m here and I’ll tell you what I want.”
“You’re here because-”
“Moteah. Stop.”
“What? It doesn’t matter if he knows. He’s going to know eventually anyways.”
Quiets Purl down.
“We captured you to kill Solraheen.”
Blinks.
Mazyd Obo in thought.
“I must admit, my initial reaction was t, but I can tell you are serious. Perhaps you all know something that I do not.”
“You think it can’t be done?”
“I have no idea.”
Stroke it. Considering it.
“I take it your plan was to, somehow, smuggle me down into Halfheart temple, and then have me blast Solraheen’s skull wide open with my voice?”
“That’s the idea.”
“Why? Solraheen is just a figurehead these days. They keep him so drugged up on havi fumes that he can’t even talk. Killing him trigger a little chaos for a while, maybe even a few years, but it won’t do a thing to change the calculus of power in Jandri.”
“If that is how you feel about killing a god, then I’m sure you won’t mind doing it.”
“I’ve always been curious to know what would happen if my torch-voice touched godflesh. Though, there’s the issue of my fee.”
“I’m not in charge, so I can’t promise you anything. I’m sure you’ll be paid well enough.”
“I’m not interested in material things. I am a Mazydai. I am Sparkless. I require a Spark.”
Silence register what it was he was asking.
“What?”
“I watched your witch Elrahet put a Spark in Mandri’s dead body. She brought him back to life. I did not believe such a thing was possible, yet I saw it with my own two eyes. If she could infuse inanimate matter with a Spark, then perhaps she could do the same for me.”

“Those are my terms, take it or leave. Given the magnitude of the task, that is all I will accept in exchange.”
“Ayram won’t go for it.”
“She’s right.”
“Then Solraheen will remain untroubled. All of the friends you have already lost, the friends you are about to lose today, they will all have died for nothing.”
“You’re a demon.”
“No, Purl, I am a slave. I know you hate my kind, but you of all people should now that my will is bound to a master. I hear you people whispering songs of freedom. You style yourselves freedom fighters, and yet you judge me for fighting for my own?”
“You’re no slave. You said it yourself, I can’t make you do anything.”
“Purl, I mean no disprespect, but you’re no s, trained from birth to hold my leash.”

Moteah stomps out of the room.
“Moteah!” Purl called. “You’re not supposed to leave!”
Moteah was already down the hall. Her chin voice came echoing back across rock.
“I’m not listening to that shlup!”
Purl stood up and made to 
“Purl, please do not leave this room.”
“Why?”
“The battle is about to commence, and this is the only safe room.”
Horn blows.
Purl rushes to the slit.
Mandri is like, “God’s they’re going to murder these people.”




No, it’s likely your people will win. They will take casualties, but they’ll win.
How? There’s seventy against twenty.
Yes, but the Hrkan soldiers stationed in Scota aren’t quality. Very little of the training those men have received will prepare them to what they’re facing. I’d expect the relative skill, Ayramun to Hrkan conscript, is likely 3 to one. What tips the balance in the Ayramun’s favor is Minting Rock’s defenses. 
What defenses?
Mandri, this is, essentially, a castle. The .
Y It’s not possible to siege it You didn’t see the buried ropes outside? The murder holes in the rock’s face?
Ah, but you don’t know what a Shade can do. It would be interesting to see how Ayram deals with it.

Crash boom.
Earthquake.
They’ve blown a hole in the rock. Splits in two.
Ants scurrying around.
Hand to hand combat.
A few archers who’d managed.
Dudes squished.
Like a geode split in two.

No  

Moto vs. Shade.
Moto wins.


The key to painting a female face is to make as few marks as possible. A swish of ink for they eye, a blotch for the lips, painted, two tear-shaped dots for the nose and maybe the slightest of contours for the nostril, and that’s it. Stop there.

            <Title>Deleuze</Title>
            <Text>SO

The reason Deleuze killed himself.
First, I thought it was because he could not come to terms with the stupidity of the average person. It’s all well and good to be a metaphysician and explore the virtual. But what happens if you hit upon a new concept, a new schema of differences that might prove useful - the horror if you do, because then you’ve got to convince the common man of the utility. It’s hard enough to convince them of the truth of anything in science - to say nothing of metaphysics. Imagine trying to convince 19th century people not to bring rabbits to Australia. “Why not?” They will ask. After all, they want to do it. They think that rabbits will give their this new land a touch of home and a spot of hunting. You tell them, “Because it will destroy the ecosystem.” They stare back at you dumbly, and blinkered minds that they are, they will not understand even if they told you, and selfish agents that they are, even if they could understand they would not believe it because there is no proof! And they will rebel if you attempt to grab their rabbits from them.
Maybe vaccinations would be a better example. Climate change. Etc. There are examples of success - leaded gasoline - successes tend to have a more prosaic nature - don’t lean on metaphysical constructions like “climate change” - TBE.
But in deleuze’s philosophy there is a framework for that which triggers a model-rebuild and thus, acceptance of new model.
 
SEP
&gt;To free a notion of “difference in itself” such that difference need not be thought on the basis of a prior horizon of identity, Deleuze looks for an “encounter,” a sensation that cannot be thought, that cannot find the empirical category under which an object can be recognized, and thus forces the “transcendent exercise” of the faculty of sensibility, when something can only be sensed. 

&gt;Here we see the dynamic genesis from intensity in sensation to the thinking of virtual Ideas. Each step here has a distinct Kantian echo. The faculties are linked in order; here Deleuze as well as Kant look to the privilege of sensibility as the origin of knowledge—the “truth of empiricism.” With sensibility, pure difference in intensity is grasped immediately in the encounter as the sentiendum, that which can only be sensed. In the differential theory of the faculties, sensibility, imagination, memory, and thought all “communicate a violence” from one to the other—here Deleuze works with the Kantian notion of the sublime as discordant accord of the faculties. The “free form of difference” in intensity moves each faculty and communicates its violence to the next, though in this case there is no supernatural vocation that will redeem the conflict of imagination and reason, as there is in the resolution to the discussion of the sublime in the Critique of Judgment. Rather than a reconciliation of the faculties, with thought, a “fractured self”—here Deleuze takes up Kant’s notion of the split between the empirical ego and the Transcendental subject—is constrained to think “difference in itself” in Ideas. 

Features of difference, for purposes of practical application in the production of ideas.

&gt;With the notions of intensive and extensive we come upon a crucial distinction for Deleuze that is explored in Chapters 4 and 5 of Difference and Repetition. Extensive quantities, such as length, area or volume, are divisible. A volume of matter divided into two equal halves produces two volumes, each having half the extent of the original one. Intensive magnitudes, by contrast, refer to properties such as temperature or pressure that cannot be so divided. If a volume of water whose temperature is 90º is divided in half, the result is two volumes at the original temperature, not two volumes at 45º. However, the important property of intensity is not that it is indivisible, but that it is a property that cannot be divided without involving a change in kind. The temperature of a volume of water, for instance, can be “divided” by heating the container from below, causing a temperature difference between the top and the bottom. In so doing, however, we change the system qualitatively; moreover, if the temperature differences reach a certain threshold (if they attain a certain “intensity” in Deleuze’s terms), the system will undergo a “phase transition,” losing symmetry and changing its dynamics, entering into a periodic pattern of motion—convection—which displays extensive properties of size: X centimeters of length and breadth. Drawing on these kinds of analyses, Deleuze will assign a transcendental status to the intensive: intensity, he argues, constitutes the genetic condition of extensive space. Intensive processes are themselves in turn structured by Ideas or multiplicities. 

&gt;An Idea or multiplicity is really a process of progressive determination of differential elements, differential relations, and singularities. Let us take these step-by-step. “Elements” must have no independent existence from the system in which they inhere; phonemes as the elements of the virtual linguistic Idea are an example Deleuze uses in Difference and Repetition. When phonemes are actualized, they enter into differential relations that determine the patterns of individual languages; thus the English phoneme /p/ is reciprocally determined by its differences from /t/, /b/, /d/, and so on. Finally, these differential relations of an individual language determine singularities or remarkable points at which the pattern of that language can shift: the Great Vowel Shift of Middle English being an example, or more prosaically, dialect pronunciation shifts. 

For another example—and here, in the applicability of his schema to widely divergent registers, is one of the aspects of Deleuze as metaphysician—let us try to construct the Idea of hurricanes. The differential elements would be material “flows” driven by intensive differences in temperature and pressure but undetermined in form (neither smooth nor turbulent, neither big nor small) and function (neither forming nor destroying of weather events). These flows qua differential elements enter into relations of reciprocal determination linking changes in any one element to changes in the others; thus temperature and pressure differences will link changes in air and water currents to each other: updrafts are related to downdrafts even if the exact relations (the tightness of the links, the velocity of the flows) are not yet determined. Finally, at singular points in these relations singularities are determined that mark qualitative shifts in the system, such as the formation of thunderstorm cells, the eye wall, and so on. But this is still the virtual Idea of hurricanes; real existent hurricanes will have measurable values of these variables so that we can move from the philosophical realm of sufficient reason to that of scientific causation. A hurricane is explained by its Idea, but it is caused by real wind currents driven by real temperature supplied by the sun to tropical waters. 

&gt;To see how Ideas are transcendental and immanent, we have to appreciate that an Idea is a concrete universal. In an early article on Bergson (“The Conception of Difference in Bergson” [1956]), Deleuze gave a particularly helpful example of this notion. In La Pensée et le Mouvant, Bergson had shown that there are two ways of determining what the spectrum of “colors” have in common. (1) You can extract from particular colors an abstract and general idea of color (“by removing from the red that which makes it red, from the blue what makes it blue, from the green what makes it green”). Or, (2) you can make all these colors “pass through a convergent lens, bringing them to a single point,” in which case a “pure white light” is obtained that “makes the differences between the shades stand out.” The former case defines a single generic “concept” with a plurality of objects; the relation between concept and object is one of subsumption; and the state of difference remains exterior to the thing. The second case, on the contrary, defines a differential Idea in the Deleuzean sense: the different colors are no longer objects under a concept, but constitute an order of mixture in coexistence and succession within the Idea; the relation between the Idea and a given color is not one of subsumption, but one of actualization and differenciation; and the state of difference between the concept and the object is internalized in the Idea itself, so that the concept itself has become the object. White light is still a universal, but it is a concrete universal, and not a genus or generality. 

 Indeed, Deleuze adopts a number of Neoplatonic notions to indicate the structure of Ideas, all of which are derived from the root word pli [fold]: perplication, complication, implication, explication, and replication. 

. Ideas define the being of a thing, but one cannot attain an Idea through the Socratic question “What is … ?” (which posits Ideas as transcendent and eternal), but rather through “minor” questions such as “Which one?” “Where?” “When?” “How?” “How many?” “In which case?” “From which viewpoint?”—all of which allow one to define the differential Ideas immanent in the intensive processes they structure.
From these examples we can see that Ideas structure the intensive processes that give rise to the behavior patterns of systems, and their singularities mark the thresholds at which systems change behavior patterns. In a word, the virtual Idea is the transformation matrix for material systems or bodies. Bodies are determined “solutions” to the “problem” that lays out the manifold options for incarnating bodies of that nature. Ideas then respond to the question “who?” (who is it that incarnates the Idea in this case?) rather than the essentialist “what is?” (what are the properties of the substance that provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the class of which the object is a member?)

Zizek on transcendental (foucault) - 
Is it possible to break out of this circle, to move beyond this transcendental approach, that we can just describe this historic horizon of meaning into which we are thrown, without returning to naive realism. Here we should be creative.

            <Title>Ambush-Mandrameen</Title>
            <Synopsis>Theives ambush gold caravan in the desert. A witch conjures storm to help them. Caravan has a mage, but storm strikes down mage before he can kill thieves. Turns out not to be a gold train - was a setup - The man who set them up? Salavan Saran.</Synopsis>
            <Text>Soon we will have captured an enemy,and we can make the spark swap then. Capyures mazyd. Cant make spark swap because mazyd has no soul.

The noble Salavan Saran liked to say that every artist who ever has tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. For him it was a simple matter of fact: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see - but nothing is more seductive than Nature. Nothing can match its grandeur and complexity at scale. Every component part of it, every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are complex systems in their own right, systems within systems, patterns within patterns. It's what Solean scriptures call infinitely nested beauty, and it really does go on for as far as it is possible to look. The shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and if the mood is right, it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve. So, Salavan argued, there is no point in trying.
Young Mandrameen disagreed with all this. He liked art. He wasn't very good, but he liked to paint landscapes, and write flower poems, and make little curvy clay sculptures of women. He was impressed by the skill on display in the things people could create and he wanted to be impressive himself. Salavan tried to explain that nothing Mandrameen could make could be considered impressive when compared to Sol's creation.
When Mandrameen came of age and continued to show no signs of &quot;getting himself together as a man&quot;, Salavan sat Mandri down and told him to go out to the Sand and see the truth of the matter for himself. He said that the Sand has a way of removing the things that blind men to Nature's beauty. He said that the desert heat would pull Mandri's mind out from his body, and if he lingered there in the sun, near to death, then his fantasies would evaporate. With his body hollow, Nature’s beauty would pour into him and force him to see the truth about the edge between himself and the Universe. Maybe then Mandri would accept the role that the Creator set out for him and all men.
Salavan didn’t think that his son would actually do it, but at the age of eighteen Mandrameen did, he ran away from home. He took up an old, unused smuggler's road that led west out of Shagota, called Scuttle Road, and it ran through the marshlands and wound up into the Hias mountains and then wiggled down their western slopes and into one of the more desolate parts of the Sand - the Junei Plain. 
Unfortunately for Mandrameen, he was a short, skinny, and too-rich city boy who’d only ever measured out leagues on a map. He didn't know that if you sleep out in the marshlands at that time of year, then you've got to sleep off the ground or else your flesh becomes a feast for the billions of darkfly spawn that wriggle in the earth. He didnt know that ----. He didn't even know that if you walk for hours and hours on end you are liable to get blisters, much less did he know how to prevent a blister from festering.
Worst of all, he didn't know that if you travel anywhere on the Jandri continent then you've got to bring more water than you think you need. Mandri had only brought one large goat skin watersack and just assumed that he’d be able to ration it and then refill it at wells along the way. But well after well in the marshlands was spoiled by salt, or algae. In one remarkable instance, he pulled up a well-bucket, and in it were handful of wet feathers, slimy meat, and bone; some bird had fallen and it its corpse was busy spoiling the water. 
He figured the well water would look better once he'd gotten out of the marshlands and up into the Hias mountains, but there on the rocky slopes he passed one well without realizing it, and then he couldn’t find the next one, and the one after that was dry.
At that point, Mandri's watersack had been empty for a whole day, and he started to get headaches, not difficult headaches but they were always there and they wouldn't let him sleep. Just as he started to feel the nausea coming on, a miracle occurred - Sol sent clouds down to rest upon the mountaintops. 
These clouds rolled in from nowhere, and they sat so low that Mandri was walking through them long before he ever reached the Hias peaks. They were so thick that cupfuls of dew collected in every crack and crevice, and Mandri's clothes were so wet from simply being in the mist that he could wring his sleeve and drink from it. 
Mandri took the arrival of this heavenly mist to be a sign, an unquestionable sign, that Sol had blessed his journey. These clouds stayed with him, nourishing him, until he'd gotten up and over the mountains and began his journey out into the Sand. 
Two days later, coming down the wesetern slopes, and he was again at the bottom of his water-sack. He began again to thirst. Each morning he licked what dew he could from the rock, but it wasn't enough. When he peed his urine almost as  dark as a roasted barley beer, and when little grey lizards heard his tinkling on the rocks they came out, took a sip of it, then spat it right back out and scurried back into the shade.
Then headaches and the nausea returned. One day later and he'd vomited out what little water was left in his body. He'd grown so weak that he was forced to toss his pack and his watersack. It was then that he knew he'd die out in the Sand. He figured that the clouds in the peaks behind him only meant to tide him over until he made it down to the Sand so that he could fulfill his journey's purpose.
To save energy he only moved at night. During the day he'd lounge in a boulder's shadow, and in between bouts of sweatless, fitful sleep he'd take in the beauty of the Sand as it stretched out below the foothills. The sight of it teased him onwards. The Junei Plain was such a vision in the afternoon: a brilliant pastel sea of pink sand dunes, yellow gypsum, and white salt, all swirled together on the landscape like paint on a painter’s palette. He had heard tell of this beauty, he had read poems, seen paintings, but his father was right - it needed to be seen in the flesh. It seemed so impossible. How could the Istil wind not blow it all together and muddy the colors? He was eager for night to come so that he could get moving again.
On Mandrameen's final night the Scuttle Road spat him out at the foot of the mountains. His head was a dizzy mess and there was a dull pain in his mouth, when he put his fingers into it to press down on the pain, he found that his tongue was drying out and shriveling. To make matters worse, there was almost no strength left in his twiggy legs. They had managed a plodding pace for as long as they could. When the road curved down into a shadowy ravine, Mandri misjudged the slope. His legs gave out as soon has he stepped down into it.  
He fell forward, flailing, and he hit the ground hard with his shoulder. Then he slid, rolled, and tumbled down into that road-hewn ravine like a limp sack of potatoes. At length he came to rest at the bottom, sore all over, and completely covered in the ochre dust of clay. 
He was on his stomach, and it took a colossal effort for him to right himself, first to get up to his elbows, and then to crawl up to the bank of the ravine to rest. He did not want to die face down. He did not want to die here. He wanted to die in the Sand.
He tried to stand up again, but his legs wobbled and gave in. Then, with a groan and a sob, Mandri pulled himself up under the husk of a nearby Karkle bush, which was as dried out and nearly dead as he was. It was a big bush though, and it's sticky branches would offer a little shade from the sun that was coming to end him. 
And then Mandri cried. 
He cried without tears because his body was so starved for moisture. He cried without a sound because his parched throat could hardly bear a whisper. He cried because of the pain, and he cried because he was so close yet so far to that vision of the beautiful Sand. Instead of losing himself in that sacred place he would suffer such a prosaic fate - death in a dark trench, with nothing but rocks, a dead bush, and dead sticks washed into that ravine by ancient rains to keep him company. 
He thought that if he slept then maybe strength would return to him. Well-rested, he could make one last march down into the Sand. In a few hours, when the morning sun came, he would get up and keep going. He closed his eyes and fell asleep.
But the morning sun does not come all at once to those foothills. There the mighty Hias peaks cast a long shadow that stretches across the whole of the Junei plain. It takes twelve fingers [fingers is a time-measurement for Jandrians] for the sun to peel the night all the way back to where Mandri slept, and when the sun did finally reach him, it was almost noon. By then he was past the point of ever getting back up. His dessicated mind was busy with the triage of his body’s functions. Trivial things like coherent thought made way for his pumping heart, for his labored breathing. He spent an hour like that, lying there in the dappled shadow of the karkle bush, gulping down the dusty, dry air like a fish out of water, not aware enough to even realize that these were his final moments. A whole hour like that, and then he died.

Are We Good Enough?
One of the commonest objections to Communism is that men are not good enough to live under a Communist state of things. They would not submit to a compulsory Communism, but they are not yet ripe for free, Anarchistic Communism. Centuries of individualistic education have rendered them too egotistic. Slavery, submission to the strong, and work under the whip of necessity, have rendered them unfit for a society where everybody would be free and know no compulsion except what results from a freely taken engagement towards the others, and their disapproval if he would not fulfill the engagement. Therefore, we are told, some intermediate transition state of society is necessary as a step towards Communism.
Old words in a new shape; words said and repeated since the first attempt at any reform, political or social, in any human society. Words which we heard before the abolition of slavery; words said twenty and forty centuries ago by those who like too much their own quietness for liking rapid changes, whom boldness of thought frightens, and who themselves have not suffered enough from the iniquities of the present society to feel the deep necessity of new issues!
Men are not good enough for Communism, but are they good enough for Capitalism? If all men were good-hearted, kind, and just, they would never exploit one another, although possessing the means of doing so. With such men the private ownership of capital would be no danger. The capitalist would hasten to share his profits with the workers, and the best-remunerated workers with those suffering from occasional causes. If men were provident they would not produce velvet and articles of luxury while food is wanted in cottages: they would not build palaces as long as there are slums.
If men had a deeply developed feeling of equity they would not oppress other men. Politicians would not cheat their electors; Parliament would not be a chattering and cheating box, and Charles Warren’s policemen would refuse to bludgeon the Trafalgar Square talkers and listeners. And if men were gallant, self-respecting, and less egotistic, even a bad capitalist would not be a danger; the workers would have soon reduced him to the role of a simple comrade-manager. Even a King would not be dangerous, because the people would merely consider him as a fellow unable to do better work, and therefore entrusted with signing some stupid papers sent out to other cranks calling themselves Kings.
But men are not those free-minded, independent, provident, loving, and compassionate fellows which we should like to see them. And precisely, therefore, they must not continue living under the present system which permits them to oppress and exploit one another. Take, for instance, those misery-stricken tailors who paraded last Sunday in the streets, and suppose that one of them has inherited a hundred pounds from an American uncle. With these hundred pounds he surely will not start a productive association for a dozen of like misery-stricken tailors, and try to improve their condition. He will become a sweater. And, therefore, we say that in a society where men are so bad as this American heir, it is very hard for him to have misery-stricken tailors around him. As soon as he can he will sweat them; while if these same tailors had a secured living from the Communist stores, none of them would sweat to enrich their ex-comrade, and the young sweater would himself not become the very bad beast he surely will become if he continues to be a sweater.
We are told we are too slavish, too snobbish, to be placed under free institutions; but we say that because we are indeed so slavish we ought not to remain any longer under the present institutions, which favour the development of slavishness. We see that Britons, French, and Americans display the most disgusting slavishness towards Gladstone, Boulanger, or Gould. And we conclude that in a humanity already endowed with such slavish instincts it is very bad to have the masses forcibly deprived of higher education, and compelled to live under the present inequality of wealth, education, and knowledge. Higher instruction and equality of conditions would be the only means for destroying the inherited slavish instincts, and we cannot understand how slavish instincts can be made an argument for maintaining, even for one day longer, inequality of conditions; for refusing equality of instruction to all members of the community.
Our space is limited, but submit to the same analysis any of the aspects of our social life, and you will see that the present capitalist, authoritarian system is absolutely inappropriate to a society of men so improvident, so rapacious, so egotistic, and so slavish as they are now. Therefore, when we hear men saying that the Anarchists imagine men much better than they really are, we merely wonder how intelligent people can repeat that nonsense. Do we not say continually that the only means of rendering men less rapacious and egotistic, less ambitious and less slavish at the same time, is to eliminate those conditions which favour the growth of egotism and rapacity, of slavishness and ambition? The only difference between us and those who make the above objection is this: We do not, like them, exaggerate the inferior instincts of the masses, and do not complacently shut our eyes to the same bad instincts in the upper classes. We maintain that both rulers and ruled are spoiled by authority; both exploiters and exploited are spoiled by exploitation; while our opponents seem to admit that there is a kind of salt of the earth – the rulers, the employers, the leaders – who, happily enough, prevent those bad men – the ruled, the exploited, the led – from becoming still worse than they are.
There is the difference, and a very important one. We admit the imperfections of human nature, but we make no exception for the rulers. They make it, although sometimes unconsciously, and because we make no such exception, they say that we are dreamers, ‘unpractical men’.
An old quarrel, that quarrel between the ‘practical men’ and the ‘unpractical’, the so-called Utopists: a quarrel renewed at each proposed change, and always terminating by the total defeat of those who name themselves practical people.
Many of us must remember the quarrel when it raged in America before the abolition of slavery. When the full emancipation of the Negroes was advocated, the practical people used to say that if the Negroes were no more compelled to labour by the whips of their owners, they would not work at all, and soon would become a charge upon the community. Thick whips could be prohibited, they said, and the thickness of the whips might be progressively reduced by law to half-an-inch first and then to a mere trifle of a few tenths of an inch; but some kind of whip must be maintained. And when the abolitionists said – just as we say now – that the enjoyment of the produce of one’s labour would be a much more powerful inducement to work than the thickest whip, ‘Nonsense, my friend,’ they were told – just as we are told now. ‘You don’t know human nature! Years of slavery have rendered them improvident, lazy and slavish, and human nature cannot be changed in one day. You are imbued, of course, with the best intentions, but you are quite ”unpractical”.’
Well, for some time the practical men had their own way in elaborating schemes for the gradual emancipation of Negroes. But, alas!, the schemes proved quite unpractical, and the civil war – the bloodiest on record – broke out. But the war resulted in the abolition of slavery, without any transition period; – and see, none of the terrible consequences foreseen by the practical people followed. The Negroes work, they are industrious and laborious, they are provident – nay, too provident, indeed – and the only regret that can be expressed is, that the scheme advocated by the left wing of the unpractical camp – full equality and land allotments – was not realised: it would have saved much trouble now.
About the same time a like quarrel raged in Russia, and its cause was this. There were in Russia 20 million serfs. For generations past they had been under the rule, or rather the birch-rod, of their owners. They were flogged for tilling their soil badly, flogged for want of cleanliness in their households, flogged for imperfect weaving of their cloth, flogged for not sooner marrying their boys and girls – flogged for everything. Slavishness, improvidence, were their reputed characteristics.
Now came the Utopists and asked nothing short of the following: Complete liberation of the serfs; immediate abolition of any obligation of the serf towards the lord. More than that: immediate abolition of the lord’s jurisdiction and his abandonment of all the affairs upon which he formerly judged, to peasants’ tribunals elected by the peasants and judging, not in accordance with law which they do not know, but with their unwritten customs. Such was the unpractical scheme of the unpractical camp. It was treated as a mere folly by practical people.
But happily enough there was by that time in Russia a good deal of unpracticalness in the air, and it was maintained by the unpracticalness of the peasants, who revolted with sticks against guns, and refused to submit, notwithstanding the massacres, and thus enforced the unpractical state of mind to such a degree as to permit the unpractical camp to force the Tsar to sign their scheme – still mutilated to some extent. The most practical people hastened to flee away from Russia, that they might not have their throats cut a few days after the promulgation of that unpractical scheme.
But everything went on quite smoothly, notwithstanding the many blunders still committed by practical people. These slaves who were reputed improvident, selfish brutes, and so on, displayed such good sense, such an organising capacity as to surpass the expectations of even the most unpractical Utopists; and in three years after the Emancipation the general physiognomy of the villages had completely changed. The slaves were becoming Men!
The Utopists won the battle. They proved that they were the really practical people, and that those who pretended to be practical were imbeciles. And the only regret expressed now by all who know the Russian peasantry is, that too many concessions were made to those practical imbeciles and narrow-minded egotists: that the advice of the left wing of the unpractical camp was not followed in full.
We cannot give more examples. But we earnestly invite those who like to reason for themselves to study the history of any of the great social changes which have occurred in humanity from the rise of the Communes to the Reform and to our modern times. They will see that history is nothing but a struggle between the rulers and the ruled, the oppressors and the oppressed, in which struggle the practical camp always sides with the rulers and the oppressors, while the unpractical camp sides with the oppressed; and they will see that the struggle always ends in a final defeat of the practical camp after much bloodshed and suffering, due to what they call their ‘practical good sense’.
If by saying that we are unpractical our opponents mean that we foresee the march of events better than the practical short-sighted cowards, then they are right. But if they mean that they, the practical people, have a better foresight of events, then we send them to history and ask them to put themselves in accordance with its teachings before making that presumptuous assertion.
 

I don’t buy the argument “communism has been tried”

Romans/Greeks - “democracy has been tried, look at where that ended up.”


Under the influence of government worship, they may try to nominate a new government, instead of the old one which will be sent away, and they may entrust it with the solution of all difficulties. It is so simple, so easy, to throw a vote into the ballot-box, and to return home! So gratifying to know that there is somebody who will arrange your own affairs for the best, while you are quietly smoking your pipe and waiting for orders which you will have only to execute, not to reason about. An admirable way, indeed, to have your affairs left as they were before, even if you are not cheated by your trustees!
History is full of such examples. The revolted people of Paris in 1871 also nominated a government, and hoped that this government ― which consisted, in fact, of the most devoted revolutionists belonging to all sections of the revolutionary world, all men ready to die for the emancipation of the people ― would settle everything for the best.
They did the same thing at Paris in 1848, when they chose a Provisional Government by acclamation, and expected that this Government ― which also consisted of honest men ― would resolve the social question.
But we know how dreadful was the awakening of the Paris proletarians, and we know by what hecatombs of slaughtered men, women, and children they paid for their confidence.

These peasants also voted in 1789, and nominated a government. But as they saw that this government did not respond to their expectations, they revolted; in fact, they did so even before they saw their government at work. They went to the landlords and compelled them to abdicate their rights. They burned the charters where these rights were written down; they burned some of the castles of the most hated nobles. And, on the night of the 4th of August, the nobility of France, moved by high patriotic feelings (so the historians say), which feelings were excited by the spectacle of burning castles, abdicated their rights for ever. 

Nations were moved to war and thousands were massacred to revenge a personal offense, -or to satisfy the ambition of an omnipotent ruler. But, manners have changed now. The omnipotent despots are disappearing, and even the autocrats are mere toys in the hands of their camarillas which camarillas however personal their aims, still submit to some influence of the opinions prevailing among the ruling classes. Wars are no longer due to personal caprices, and still they are as, numerous as, and much more cruel than, they formerly were. The Republican faith which said, Suppress personal power, and you will have no wars,' proved to be false. Thus, for instance, in the pending Conflict between England and Russia no personal causes are at work. The Russian Czar entertains personally quite friendly relations with English rulers, and surely he dreads war much more than any of his soldiers who would he massacred on the battle-fields. As to the English Premier, it is a secret to nobody that be tenderly, much too tenderly, looks on the 'Czar of All the Russias,' and still both countries are ready to fight. Not, that the eighty millions of our peasants sing very warlike songs just now, as they are asking themselves how they will manage to keep body and Sold together until the next harvest, the last handful of flour already having been swept tip and eaten, together with dust and straw. Not that the English miners or weavers, who also ask themselves how to go through the industrial crisis, are inspired with much hatred towards the famine-struck Russian peasants. But it is so: gunpowder smells in the air, and a few weeks ago we were so near fighting that if we escape from war, it surely will be. a very narrow escape. The reason is very plain. Wars are no more fought, for personal reasons, still less are they occasioned by national idiosyncrasies: they are fought for markets

Paucity of life, under-population — not over-population — being the distinctive feature of that immense part of the globe which we name Northern Asia, I conceived since then serious doubts — which subsequent study has only confirmed — as to the reality of that fearful competition for food and life within each species, which was an article of faith with most Darwinists, and, consequently, as to the dominant part which this sort of competition was supposed to play in the evolution of new species. 


Consequently, when my attention was drawn, later on, to the relations between Darwinism and Sociology, I could agree with none of the works and pamphlets that had been written upon this important subject. They all endeavoured to prove that Man, owing to his higher intelligence and knowledge, may mitigate the harshness of the struggle for life between men; but they all recognized at the same time that the struggle for the means of existence, of every animal against all its congeners, and of every man against all other men, was “a law of Nature.” This view, however, I could not accept, because I was persuaded that to admit a pitiless inner war for life within each species, and to see in that war a condition of progress, was to admit something which not only had not yet been proved, but also lacked confirmation from direct observation. 

On the contrary, a lecture “On the Law of Mutual Aid,” which was delivered at a Russian Congress of Naturalists, in January 1880, by the well-known zoologist, Professor Kessler, the then Dean of the St. Petersburg University, struck me as throwing a new light on the whole subject.  Kessler’s idea was, that besides the law of Mutual Struggle there is in Nature the law of Mutual Aid, which, for the success of the struggle for life, and especially for the progressive evolution of the species, is far more important than the law of mutual contest. This suggestion — which was, in reality, nothing but a further development of the ideas expressed by Darwin himself in The Descent of Man — seemed to me so correct and of so great an importance, that since I became acquainted with it (in 1883) I began to collect materials for further developing the idea, which Kessler had only cursorily sketched in his lecture, but had not lived to develop. He died in 1881. 

The importance of the Mutual Aid factor — “if its generality could only be demonstrated” — did not escape the naturalist’s genius so manifest in Goethe. When Eckermann told once to Goethe — it was in 1827 — that two little wren-fledglings, which had run away from him, were found by him next day in the nest of robin redbreasts (Rothkehlchen), which fed the little ones, together with their own youngsters, Goethe grew quite excited about this fact. He saw in it a confirmation of his pantheistic views, and said: — “If it be true that this feeding of a stranger goes through all Nature as something having the character of a general law — then many an enigma would be solved. “He returned to this matter on the next day, and most earnestly entreated Eckermann (who was, as is known, a zoologist) to make a special study of the subject, adding that he would surely come “to quite invaluable treasuries of results” (Gespräche, edition of 1848, vol. iii. pp. 219, 221). Unfortunately, this study was never made, although it is very possible that Brehm, who has accumulated in his works such rich materials relative to mutual aid among animals, might have been inspired by Goethe’s remark. 

Consequently I thought that a book, written on Mutual Aid as a Law of Nature and a factor of evolution, might fill an important gap. When Huxley issued, in 1888, his “Struggle-for-life” manifesto (Struggle for Existence and its Bearing upon Man), which to my appreciation was a very incorrect representation of the facts of Nature, as one sees them in the bush and in the forest, I communicated with the editor of the Nineteenth Century, asking him whether he would give the hospitality of his review to an elaborate reply to the views of one of the most prominent Darwinists; and Mr. James Knowles received the proposal with fullest sympathy. I also spoke of it to W. Bates. “Yes, certainly; that is true Darwinism,” was his reply. “It is horrible what ‘they’ have made of Darwin. Write these articles, and when they are printed, I will write to you a letter which you may publish.” Unfortunately, it took me nearly seven years to write these articles, and when the last was published, Bates was no longer living. 


For primitive Man — they maintain — war of each against all was the law of life. In how far this assertion, which has been too willingly repeated, without sufficient criticism, since the times of Hobbes, 

“the weakest and stupidest went to the wall, while the toughest and shrewdest, those who were best fitted to cope with their circumstances, but not the best in another way, survived. Life was a continuous free fight, and beyond the limited and temporary relations of the family, the Hobbesian war of each against all was the normal state of existence.”[2] 

The readiness of the Russian zoologists to accept Kessler’s views seems quite natural, because nearly all of them have had opportunities of studying the animal world in the wide uninhabited regions of Northern Asia and East Russia; and it is impossible to study like regions without being brought to the same ideas. I recollect myself the impression produced upon me by the animal world of Siberia when I explored the Vitim regions in the company of so accomplished a zoologist as my friend Polyakoff was. 

s to the beetles, we have quite well-observed facts of mutual help amidst the burying beetles (Necrophorus). They must have some decaying organic matter to lay their eggs in, and thus to provide their larvæ with food; but that matter must not decay very rapidly. So they are wont to bury in the ground the corpses of all kinds of small animals which they occasionally find in their rambles. As a rule, they live an isolated life, but when one of them has discovered the corpse of a mouse or of a bird, which it hardly could manage to bury itself, it calls four, six, or ten other beetles to perform the operation with united efforts; if necessary, they transport the corpse to a suitable soft ground; and they bury it in a very considerate way, without quarrelling as to which of them will enjoy the privilege of laying its eggs in the buried corpse. And when Gleditsch attached a dead bird to a cross made out of two sticks, or suspended a toad to a stick planted in the soil, the little beetles would in the same friendly way combine their intelligences to overcome the artifice of Man. The same combination of efforts has been noticed among the dung-beetles. 

One of them had fallen upon its back in a corner of the tank, and its heavy saucepan-like carapace prevented it from returning to its natural position, the more so as there was in the corner an iron bar which rendered the task still more difficult. Its comrades came to the rescue, and for one hour’s time I watched how they endeavoured to help their fellow-prisoner. They came two at once, pushed their friend from beneath, and after strenuous efforts succeeded in lifting it upright; but then the iron bar would prevent them from achieving the work of rescue, and the crab would again heavily fall upon its back. After many attempts, one of the helpers would go in the depth of the tank and bring two other crabs, which would begin with fresh forces the same pushing and lifting of their helpless comrade. We stayed in the Aquarium for more than two hours, and, when leaving, we again came to cast a glance upon the tank: the work of rescue still continued! Since I saw that, I cannot refuse credit to the observation quoted by Dr. Erasmus Darwin — namely, that “the common crab during the moulting season stations as sentinel an unmoulted or hard-shelled individual to prevent marine enemies from injuring moulted individuals in their unprotected state. 

many species of ants is the fact and the obligation for every ant of sharing its food, already swallowed and partly digested, with every member of the community which may apply for it. Two ants belonging to two different species or to two hostile nests, when they occasionally meet together, will avoid each other. But two ants belonging to the same nest or to the same colony of nests will approach each other, exchange a few movements with the antennæ, and “if one of them is hungry or thirsty, and especially if the other has its crop full... it immediately asks for food.” The individual thus requested never refuses; it sets apart its mandibles, takes a proper position, and regurgitates a drop of transparent fluid which is licked up by the hungry ant. Regurgitating food for other ants is so prominent a feature in the life of ants (at liberty), and it so constantly recurs both for feeding hungry comrades and for feeding larvæ, that Forel considers the digestive tube of the ants as consisting of two different parts, one of which, the posterior, is for the special use of the individual, and the other, the anterior part, is chiefly for the use of the community. If an ant which has its crop full has been selfish enough to refuse feeding a comrade, it will be treated as an enemy, or even worse. If the refusal has been made while its kinsfolk were fighting with some other species, they will fall back upon the greedy individual with greater vehemence than even upon the enemies themselves. And if an ant has not refused to feed another ant belonging to an enemy species, it will be treated by the kinsfolk of the latter as a friend. All this is confirmed by most accurate observation and decisive experiments 

The ants and termites have renounced the “Hobbesian war,” and they are the better for it. Their wonderful nests, their buildings, superior in relative size to those of man; their paved roads and overground vaulted galleries; their spacious halls and granaries; their corn-fields, harvesting and “malting” of grain;[9] their, rational methods of nursing their eggs and larvæ, and of building special nests for rearing the aphides whom Linnæus so picturesquely described as “the cows of the ants”; and, finally, their courage, pluck, and, superior intelligence — all these are the natural outcome of the mutual aid which they practise at every stage of their busy and laborious lives. That mode of life also necessarily resulted in the development of another essential feature of the life of ants: the immense development of individual initiative which, in its turn, evidently led to the development of that high and varied intelligence which cannot but strike the human observer. 

 It is well known that there always are a number of bees which prefer a life of robbery to the laborious life of a worker; and that both periods of scarcity and periods of an unusually rich supply of food lead to an increase of the robbing class. When our crops are in and there remains but little to gather in our meadows and fields, robbing bees become of more frequent occurrence; while, on the other side, about the sugar plantations of the West Indies and the sugar refineries of Europe, robbery, laziness, and very often drunkenness become quite usual with the bees. We thus see that anti-social instincts continue to exist amidst the bees as well; but natural selection continually must eliminate them, because in the long run the practice of solidarity proves much more advantageous to the species than the development of individuals endowed with predatory inclinations. The cunningest and the shrewdest are eliminated in favour of those who understand the advantages of sociable life and mutual support. 

Bakunin - gods punishment is very profound and just precisely because it is so monstrously iniquitous and absurd.
Nothing is more dangerous for man's private morality than the habit of command. The best man, the most intelligent, disinterested, generous, pure, will infallibly and always be spoiled at this trade. Two sentiments inherent in power never fail to produce this demoralisation; they are: contempt for the masses and the overestimation of one's own merits. 
&quot;The masses&quot; a man says to himself, &quot; recognising their incapacity to govern on their own account, have elected me their chief. By that act they have publicly proclaimed their inferiority and my superiority. Among this crowd of men, recognising hardly any equals of myself, I am alone capable of directing public affairs. The people have need of me; they cannot do without my services, while I, on the contrary, can get along all right by myself; they, therefore, must obey me for their own security, and in condescending to obey them, I am doing them a good turn.&quot; 
Is there not something in all that to make a man lose his head and his heart as well, and become mad with pride? It is thus that power and the habit of command become for even the most intelligent and virtuous men, a source of aberration, both intellectual and moral.

Catarrh is an exudate of inflamed mucous membranes in one of the airways or cavities of the body,[1][2] usually with reference to the throat and paranasal sinuses. It can result in a thick exudate of mucus and white blood cells caused by the swelling of the mucous membranes in the head in response to an infection. It is a symptom usually associated with the common cold, pharyngitis, and chesty coughs, but it can also be found in patients with adenoiditis, otitis media, sinusitis or tonsillitis. The phlegm produced by catarrh may either discharge or cause a blockage that may become chronic.
The word &quot;catarrh&quot; was widely used in medicine since before the era of medical science, which explains why it has various senses and in older texts may be synonymous with, or vaguely indistinguishable from, common cold, nasopharyngitis, pharyngitis, rhinitis, or sinusitis. The word is no longer as widely used in American medical practice, mostly because more precise words are available for any particular disease.

 Hegel’s uncompromising and supposedly “totalizing” rationalism: his inability, it was charged, to do sufficient justice to the concrete particularity of human existence, to the unconceptualizable human individual, to the role of unreason in human motivation, to the contingency of historical change, and to the phenomena of interest to psychoanalysis, like repetition and the death drive.

 For in perceiving, I am also conscious of perceiving, conscious of myself perceiving. In believing anything, I am conscious of my believing, of myself committed to a belief. In acting, I would not be acting, were I not conscious of myself acting. (An action is not something that goes on whether I am conscious of it or not, like water boiling. It is only action if I am conscious of myself acting.)

Lacan says that we’re ‘lacking subjects’ that can never be fully whole, so what we desire is basically desire itself to avoid recognizing our perpetual, inescapable fragmentation. It’s not ‘what is my unconscious desire’ but rather ‘why is my desire taking this particular form, as a means to avoid The Real’ (The Real is basically the absolute nothingness at the ‘center of our being,’ that emptiness that makes us lacking subjects).
Marx says that material reality actually produces the ideas that we think we’ve thought up, as opposed to our ideas being what shape material reality (this is basically a simple summation of ideology in general - that when you believe a particular idea or concept or symbol or meaning etc. is governing your behavior and shaping the world, you are ‘in ideology). Marx said we’re not aware that we’re ‘doing ideology’ because we believe our ideas are in charge of making the world.
Zizek combines Marx and Lacan, along with Hegel, to say that actually we’re aware that we’re ‘doing ideology’ because we like ideology as a method for avoiding The Real - avoiding the innate lacking part of our subjectivity. The Hegel part comes in from the lens of the ‘sublime,’ which is his notion of the overcoming of constriction and the development or growth of something new (i.e. the drive for freedom). Where Lacan and Marx would say we cannot ever ‘be free,’ Zizek says Hegel can be redeemed if we give up our subjectivity. Stop doing, consuming, engaging in society etc. and let the whole thing breakdown. Just be, in a sense. No subjectivity, no lack, no desire drive, no commodity fetishism, and so on (tee hee). 

These philosphers are dumb but they get paid, because people love knowledge so much they’ll pay for the aesthetic of it.

Its not the end of history. We are still slaves to the crust of what has come before. The end of history is akin to a religious awakening where one is killed and receives a new body - or the existential forging of one’s future from nothign. 
E.G. communism has been tried and it failed. So had democracy. In so many, the conception of what is possible is limited to history and circumstance, not even willing to entertain a vision of a better world.

Bladimir lossky - no theology without mysticism.

Theosis - becoming diving - eastern othrodox church. Hesychat- apophatic - god is beyond human understanding. Clement of alexandria - we can only attain to god in study of what he is not. Pseudo-dionysius - the mystical theology. We can never know god or what he is because he is unknowable. It is through unknowing that we approach the ineffable darkness of the godhead.

Western mystics like eckhart

Him who is above every possible object of knowledge. Proceeding by negations one ascens from the inferior degrees of being to the highest, by progressily setting aside all that can be known, in order to draw near to the Unknown in the darkness of absolute ignorance.

Me - He is that which is Unknown. He resides in the darkness of absoulute ignorance, and so to find him, one must set aside all that can be known.

A means of attaining union with him through prayer - abandoning knowledge - meditation.

Hesychasm - tradition of meditation and prayer in the eastern orthodox church. 14th century and before. Unity with god. Direct experience with gods light through turning inward of contemplation. 
Hesychia - inner stillness. Body postures and breathing techniques and prayers. Head bowed, chin reaching chest, eyes on the heart, breathing done in time with the prayers. 

THe Jesus prayer - Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, Have mercy upon me. 
Not dissimilar to yoga. But body postures are to simply aid concentration.

Turn inward, journy into apophatic darkness, beyond all understanding and paradoxically, the light of god is experienced.

Each of us is a ‘living theology’, and because we are god’s icon, we can find god by looking within our own heart, by ‘returning within ourselves’.

“He who knows himself, knows God.”

“When you see your brother or sister, you see god.”

Controversy - called it heretical - how could god’s light be experienced with the eyes. This must be a created light, not the creator itself.

Gregory palamas - mt. Athos. So successful that he’s mainstream
Triads for the defence of those who practice sacred quietude.
God’s essence and God’s energies

Essence of god - totally beyond all comprehension . God is not a nature, for he is above all nature. He is not a being, for he is above all beings, no single thing of all that is created has or ever will have even the slightest communion with the supreme nature or nearness to it.

Energies - 
Relationship of god with the created world  - how god manifests himself to created things
- not created - fully god but not the same as the essence.
They are outpourings of the divine nature which cannot set bouds to itself, for god is more tha nessence. The energies might be described as that mode of existence of the trinity which is outside of its inaccessible essence. 

All of creation is a gigantic Burning Bush, permeated but not consumed by the ineffable and wondrous fire of God’s energies.

Eckhart 
Marguerite porete
Passed by god in the abyss. 
I speak in all truth, that this same ligh (the spark of the soul) is not content with the simple divine essence in its repose, as it neither gives nor receives; but it wants to know the source of this issence, it wants to go into the simple ground, into the quiet desert ,into which distinction never gazed, not the father ,nor the son, nor the holy spirit. In breaking through, when I come to be free of will of myself and of god’s will and of all his works and of god himself, then I am above all created things, and I am neither god nor creature, but I am what I was and what I shall remain, now and eternally. As long as the soul has god, knows god and is aware of god, she is far from god. The greatest honor the soul can pay to god is to leave god to himself and be free of him. 

When complete self-realization has been reached, and we have returned to the limitless ground where the soul and god is without distinction, god unbecomes or dies, we leave god behind and exist only in the ground which is god’s true essence. We have broken through into total unity with the divine.

“You should completly sink away for your you-ness and flow into his his-ness and your you and his his shall become one ‘our’ so totally that with him you eternally comprehend his unbecoming isness and his unnamed nothingness.

Once you break through into the ground of god’s being, we let go of all virtues and religious obligations

Mahmud shabistari
When absolute existence is alluded to, people use the word “I” as a matter of expression. When reality has taken form through individuation, you refer to It in language with the word “I”. You and I are ‘accidents’ of the Essence of Being, like openings in the covering of the lamp of Being.

Ibn ‘arabi and the unity of being

Beloved, I sought you
Here and there,
 Asked for news of you
From all I met;
Then saw you through myself
And found we were identitcal.
Now I blush to think I ever searched for signs of you.

            <Text>The rule-following paradox threatens our ordinary beliefs and practices concerning meaning because it implies that there is no such thing as meaning something by an expression or sentence. John McDowell explains this as follows. We are inclined to think of meaning in contractual terms: that is, that meanings commit or oblige us to use words in a certain way. When you grasp the meaning of the word &quot;dog&quot;, for example, you know that you ought to use that word to refer to dogs, and not cats. But if there cannot be rules governing the uses of words, as the rule-following paradox apparently shows, this intuitive notion of meaning is utterly undermined. 

Kripke holds that other commentators on Philosophical Investigations have believed that the private language argument is presented in sections occurring after §243.[3] Kripke reacts against this view, noting that the conclusion to the argument is explicitly stated by §202, which reads “Hence it is not possible to obey a rule ‘privately’: otherwise thinking one was obeying a rule would be the same as obeying it.” Further, in this introductory section, Kripke identifies Wittgenstein's interests in the philosophy of mind as related to his interests in the foundations of mathematics, in that both subjects require considerations about rules and rule-following 

Kripke's skeptical solution is this: A language-user's following a rule correctly is not justified by any fact that obtains about the relationship between their candidate application of a rule in a particular case and the putative rule itself (as for Hume the causal link between two events a and b is not determined by any particular fact obtaining between them taken in isolation); rather, the assertion that the rule that is being followed is justified by the fact that the behaviors surrounding the candidate instance of rule-following (by the candidate rule-follower) meet other language users' expectations. That the solution is not based on a fact about a particular instance of putative rule-following—as it would be if it were based on some mental state of meaning, interpretation, or intention—shows that this solution is skeptical in the sense Kripke specifies. 

Rock in the void
nothing can be said about the rock. It is not big, it is not small, soft or hard. These terms don't mean anything except in relation to something else
So we add another rock. Now the two rocks have identities. One is bigger than the other, sharper or softer.
so it would seem that identity doesn't exist except in a notion of difference.
However, we started with 'a rock'. There was something there. I call this the essence of the object.
The essence is explored through difference, though it transcends difference. Keep packing in more and more objects into this void and we are refining the rock's identity more and more
If we put every conceivable object into this void, we approach, asymptotically, an understanding of the rock's essence, and in doing so we would a
approach an understanding of everything;s essence. so this is a kind of monism.

So, based on the understanding of differences, we build an identity, or model of understanding, of the rock, though by nature, this identity is flawed.
As humans, our capacity for storage and precision of differences is fundamentally limited, so our models are *very* imprecise, and So
we are *in effect* 'postmodern' creatures, if not in actuality. Like I have an understanding of how smart you are, based of a little bit of conversation,
but to really know the nature of your intelligence, I would have to cleave to your mind every moment of the day. This is fundamentally not possible,
so my model of your intelligence is wrong. Now, somebody, somewhere, has the *most* accurate understanding of your intelligence, and to the extent that they can prove that
we should believe them.

Only hard sciences approach a method for proving more accurate understanding of things.

Now, one could say that we did not start with a 'rock' we started already with a collection of differences. A bunch of atoms in arrangment. but if you
reduce down to the simplest material thing, a quark or whatever, muon lepton, or vibrating strings, nothing about these things can be said in a void - spin up, down, mass, etc.
 All these properties are in relation to something else.

 the existence of that rock requires the existence of everything else because we live in a particular universe. anti-boltzman brain.

He wonders if there was not more happiness for men in the old aristocratic doctrine that the good is not liberty but wisdom and contement with one’s natural restrictions. The classical tradition knew that only a few can win but now that democracy has opened the great free-for-all catches catch can wrestling match of laissez-faire industrialism, every soul is torn with climbing and no one knows content. Classes war against one another without restraint and whoever is victorious in this struggle for which liberalism cleared the field, will make an end of liberalism. This is tthe nemesis of revolutions too, that in order to ssurvive they must restore the tyranny which they destroyed. Revolutions are ambiguious things. Their usccess is generally proportionate to their power of adaptation and their reabsorption within them of what they have rebelled against. A thousand reforms have left the world as corrupt as ever for each successful reform has founded a new institution adn this institution has spread its new and congenial abuses.
What form of society, then should we strive fore? Perhaps for noe. There is not much difference among them, but if for anyone in particular this would be democracy. This would be government by men of merit and honor it would be an aristocracy but not hereditary. Every man and woman would have an open road according to ability to the highest offices in the state. But the road would be closed to incopetence no matter how richly furnished it might be with plebicites. The only equality subsustieing would be equality of opportunity. Under such a gov coorruption would be at a minimun, and science and artist would florusih to discriminating encouragmenet.

The beginning of wisdom is disillusionment - (but it is also the beginning of madness.)

A thorough materialst, one born to the faith and not half-plunged into it by an unexpected christening in cold water, will be like the superb democritus. A laughing philosopher.

Henri bergson -

So placid and self-contained. The confucian peacefulness of your dog is no philosophic calm, no quiet surface of unfathomed depth. It is the certainty of instinct a orderliness of an animal that need not and cannot choose. In the animal invention is never anytihng but a variation on the theme of routine, shut up in the habits of the species it succeeds no doubt in enlarging them by its individual initiative but it escapes automatism only for an instant for just the time to create a new automatism. The gates of its prison close as soon as they are opened. By pulling at its chain it succeeds only in stretching it. With man, consciousness breaks the chain in man and man alone. It sets itself free.

It is not necessary to have a stomach to digest, nor even special organs to digest. An amoeba digests although it is an almost undifferentiatied protoplasmic mass.

The focus on duration being a real things.

Life. The procreate urge of the world. It is the opposite of inertia, and the opposie of accident. There is a direction in the growth to wh ich it is self-impelled. Against it is the undertow of matter. The lag and slack of things ttoward relaxation and rest and death. At every stage life has had to fight against its vehicle.

Me - the one who remembers history is bound to repeat it. - the future is bound by lines of immanence in the present.

In war, morale and opinion are half the battle.

            <Text>He leaps off the cot and kicks it rolling on its casters in bloat’s direction. Bloat, plummeting, hits square amidships with a great strum of bedsprings. One of the legs collapses. “Good morning,” notes Pirate. Bloat smiles briiefly and goes back to sleep, snuggling well into Pirate’s blanket.

Pirate has become famous for his banana breakfasts. Messmates throng here from all over england, even some who are allergic or outright hostile to bananas, just to watch—for the politics of bacteria, the soil’s stringing of rings and chains in nets only god acan tell the meshes of, have seen the fruit thrive often to lengths of a foot and a half, yes amazing but true.

Icefields below a cold smear of sun.

Oh, oh, yes: around the curve of the Earth, farther east, the sun over there, just risen over in Holland, is striking the rockets’ exhaust, drops and crystals, making them blaze clear across the sea…

The pores of his face are prickling. 

Osbie Feel stands in teh minstrels’ gallery, holding one of the biggest of pirate’s bananas so that it protrudes out the fly of his striped pajama bottoms— stroking with his other hand the great jaundiced curve in triplets against 4/4 toweard the ceiling, he acknoledges dawn with the following:  song.


So the same assertion-through-structure allows this war morning’s banana fragance to meander, repossess, prevail. 

Mashed banans molded in the shape of a british lion rampant, bllended with eggs into a batter for french toast, squeezed out a pastry nozzle across the quivering creamy reaches of a manan blancmange to spell out the words c’est ma….tall cruets of pale banana syrp to p our oozing over banana waffles, a giant glazed crock where diced bananas have been fermenting since the summer with wild honey and muscat raisins, up out of which, this winter morning, one now dips foam mugsfull of banana mead… banaa croissants and banana kerplach, and banana oatmeawl and banana jam, and banana bread, and bananas flamed in ancient brandy pirate brought back last year from a cellar in the pyrenees also containing a clandestineradio transmitter…

The phone call, when it comes, rips easily across the room, the hangovers, the grabassing, the clatter of dishes, the shoptalk, the bitter chuckles, like a rude metal double-fart, and pirate knows it’s got to be for him.

Adenoid preteration

Like a stupendous nose sucking in snot.

But by then, the firm was allowing pirate only tiny homeopathic doses of peace, just enough to keep his defenses up, but not enough for it to poison him.

Flagstones are slippery with mist. It is the dark, hard, tobacco-starved, headachy, sour-stomach middle of the day, a milllion bureaucrats are diligently…

—me— a gumpopping smile

Shit in bottom of sack.
Things have fallen roughly into layers, over a base of bureaucratic smegma that ifts steadily to the bottom, made up of millions of tiny red and brown curls of rubber eraser, pencil shavings, dried tea or coffe stains, traces of sugar and household milk, much cigarette ash, very fine black debris picked and flung from typwriter ribbons, decomposing library paste, broken aspirins ground to powder.

Beksinski - 
Start off with brutal crime in the backwoods - (ai experiencing slaughter)
Priest sent in to console victim family - meets with perp - have a discussion of universe
- themes of the universe
- perp talks about things that create themselves
- priest talks about love, about relationships. 
- perp says thats not written in the stars
- priest says it’s written in causality. Everything is relational. There is no time or space, there are only relationships. 
- priest says everything is love - love is nearness - what you did was an act of love - corrupted love but that’s what it was.
- perp inexplicably escapes
- priest becomes obsessed with the case
- finds clues that lead to Beksinski.
- interview with priest
	- the theme of the universe - the universe creates itself. Stars coalesce. Planets. Moons. Solarsystem. Live evolves. It creates itself. God creates things that creates themselves. It’s the grand theme of creation. You must see it.
	- Well, like all great works of art, we see different things. Different interpretations. I think the theme is love. Abstract I know. Redefining the word. It is nearness. Depending upon something else for your own identity. That is love. That is relationships. That is all that exists. That is God. That is the Universe.


Ya’ll remember that thing with the planes.
Wild how I can say so little info, and you know immediately what I’m talking about. That thing with the planes. What a big deal. Can’t say, ‘that thing with the plane’, cause then I could be talking about a whole host of things. Sully diving into the hudson. Russia shooting down that flight with all those dutch scientists onboard. Snakes on a plane. But there’s never been something to rival 9/11, something with multiple planes.
It got me to thinking what other things I could just throw out a general description of and you’d know what I’m talking about. There’s the obvious one: that thing with the jews. Conversely, that thing with the Germans.
It’s kind of sad that ‘that thing with the blacks’ doesnt quite work. It almost does. You’d hope it would just be the transatlantic slave trade, and we’d be done with it, but there’s been too much shit in the interim. Rodney king. George Floyd. Crack Cocaine. AIDS.



Murder suspect talking about multi-level marketing when the biggest moment of life is impending. Bout to be accused of murder, and they talk about other shit to delay what they know is coming. A moment of escape from the most terrifying moment of their life. Denial.
The detective dangles hope for 45 minutes. Dective knows she did it, but ‘toys’ with the prey. Cruel. Ostensibly, to get most information as possible. Continuously claw at her own salvation. Divulge information that will be damaging to her defense later on.

Detective accuses guy, says he has proof. Guy is innocent, gives a non-verbal challenge (like, wtf? Tilt of head, furrowed brow.) Maintains eye contact through head movement - establishes that he is the more confident person in the room at the moment.

A harrowing mixture of pain, regret, and resignation in his voice. The junkie. The antihero.

A kind of muttering drawl caused by a toothache.  A jawache. 

Glimmer of humanity - “Thanks for the coke” - the smaller things reveal the most. Extends teh gratitude and recognition of the small favor he has done for him. Element of selflessness and grace of the act.

Anders Breivik - mothers dislike of him began in the womb. She believed he was kicking her on purpose. After he was, born, she thought he was intent on destroying her, and was fundamentally evil. Thought he was clingy and demanding. She left him alone for long periods of time. Mother often told him that she wished he was dead. Had a smile that was not connected to his feelings. Was aggressive and she projected sexual fantasies onto him. Mother hated all men and projected this onto Anders. 



Seems heartless to take a child from his mother like that.
Being a Jedi is essentially selfish pursuit, because if we cannot master ourselves, we cannot help others. To do that, we cannot give parts of ourselves to other people. Even to our mothers. You cannot master yourself if someone else has a piece of you. In most sapient biologies, family has an imprinting that must be avoided. Varies in age, but if we cannot get to a child before he is too old, before he has given a part of himself to his mother, his father, then we are too late.
If they don’t ever experience those relationships, then how could you ever empathise with someone who does?

Stress is what kept me awake last night. Stress over something that doesn’t affect me at all. My primitive systems have been hijacked by corporate marketing agencies.

This is the modern life. They *know* what they’re doing.

“Is there are Parker here?” Frustration
“Dolores Parker”
Nurse just stands there.
“Are you parker, “ Another nurse asks.
“Yes. But what’s the first name?”
“I’m not allowed to say the first name, that’s a Hippa violation.”
“Is it Dolores Parker?”
“Dolores Parker.”
Old woman: “Alright. You should just say the first name. I can’t hear well you know.”
“I’m not allowed to say the full name. That’s a Hippa violotaion.”
“Well I can’t hear well.”
“Alright, Ill try to remember that next time you come in.”

Dumb fuck argument about rosetta stone staying in england - because of the provenance, it only has value because its in britain. I could go to britain and piss on the rosetta stone. It would cause such a commotion world wide that it would probably increase the value of the object. Doesthat mean that I would be justified in doing it? No.

The bullshit of ‘provenance’. Art world died as soon as art collectors realized that what really made the big bucks wasn’t aesthetic power, but the story behind the work. After all, what is the worth of a splinter, what is the worth of a piece of the true cross. 
Aesthetics will have their niche, but its not everyday that a skilled artist who’se spent decades mastering a craft walks in through the door. In the meantime, dealers have to make a living somehow, so they do it by selling stories to dumbfucks looking for prestige.

What am I thinking of right now.
I’m not a mind reader.
So you cant do it?
Whatever it was you were thinking of, you wouldn’t me, say it out loud.
Is that so.
That being the case, and judging by the way you’re practically licking your lips, I think I can guess what it was - wink wink.


Guy on roganesque talk show
See, the problem with your show, is that it feasts on a quirk of human biology. We’re social creatures. If there’s twenty of us roughing it out on the praire, damn it we better know what our neighbor’s opinions on things are, we better abosrb and talk about them. They effect us! And the thing is, we can sit there, and ‘talk to eachtoher’ about them, and come to a resolution, and press forward! Now you’ve got this mass media, and our monkey brains can’t separate the opinion from practical reality. We can’t talk to eachtoher, the scale of it, so we can’t come to a resolution. It’s perverse!

Argument about coffee - little left in the pot and didnt refill

As his mind crept towards this jeweled stasis, its even keel was disturbed by a brief, yearning protestation to stay alert, so that he might revel in the experience of dying for as long as possible, so that his last transcendent moment might be one worthy of eternity - if that was how it worked.

When I killed them they were already dead. That’s what the jedi did. The took them from their cribs, ripped them out of their mothers arms.

About as smart as a walking, talking colony of cellular organisms can be. Which is to say, not very smart.

Consider: god desires to destroy humanity, but is convinced by man and family to let them live.

It’s like that old quote, “the greatest trick the devil ever pulled, is convincing the world he doesn’t exist.”
Yeah, makes sense. Its like in old ancient world, he and demons are torturing people, thinking thats the best way to get people to turn from god. But no, its make life easy. Give them time to sit think. Idle. Keep them idle. Give them security. When you’re secure you don’t need god. When you’re not in prison, you don’t need salvation.

            <Text>Chapter 1 : Ayram
  
______________


The poet Mandrameen once said that every artist who has tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. For him the problem is always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see - but nothing is more seductive than Nature. Nothing can match it’s grandeur and complexity at scale, for inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns for as far as it is possible to look. The shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and if the mood is right, it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve.
Mandrameen taught that the Sand focuses this beauty. There the desert heat pulls the mind out from the body, like a cork from a bottle, and if you are left to linger in the sun, all desires, plots, and fantasies will evaporate. Nothing is left to support a delicate ego. When Nature’s beauty rushes in, it flushes the ego out, it loses it in the wide open spaces of sand and sky. All that’s left for the inner eye to see is the truth about the edge between one’s self and the Universe.
Or so Mandrameen believed. 
It was at least an honest attempt to explain why all religions of the Empire were born in the Sand, and why the beating heart of each of them is the grand city of Jeket, Jewel of the Desert, an oasis in the middle of the world. 
The cynic Seculla took a different view. She claimed that prophets and messiahs flock to the Sand - and Jeket in particular - because gold flows through it. The stuff filters into the city from mines in the interior, and once the cut is taken, it leaves down river then out to sea towards Carcina, the Empire’s capital. 
Whether or not this is true is a matter of taste. What is undeniable is that, for most folk, gold is more tempting than eternal salvation. After all, gold is just as bright and as immutable as the Divine, but you can touch it. If a pure, soft, sparkling spot of it gets into your hands you’ll be struck with a yearning akin to spiritual rapture, a yearning for more of it, for as much as you can get. The more enterprising religions channel this effect by casting the gold into idols, and use it to ornament their sacred texts and the walls of their heavenly dwellings. The way that gold scintillates in the candlelight of a dark and cloistered room creates an impression of holiness that is strong enough to lure pilgrims out to shrines nestled deep in the Sand. In such hallowed places, the chosen few may hear the whispered calls of their deities, but godless folk claim that its just the whisperings of the gold, for they hear it too, they can hear it even deep in the ground, and like pious men they devote their lives to the call. 
Whatever the reasons for the greed, the religiosity, the pilgrims, the gold, the Empire and its merchant companies, the stage was set in Jeket for Ayram and the band of thirty three killers that followed him. They were religious in their own way, zealots of a kind, but chiefly they were known as thieves, and they were simply too skilled to ever be captured. 
Pella would say, “Too cautious to be captured”, and as the eldest of Ayram’s band, that was how she liked it. She was sensitive to the risks that younger folk were willing to take, for she had made many of them herself - her fake brass nose could attest to that. Its hard and sparkling sheen stood out oddly against her loose and wrinkled skin, almost as if it were wearing her instead of the other way around. For Pella, it was a reminder of her duty to preach caution and steer the young pups away from prey that fights back. 
This imperative dwelled deep in her old arthritic bones, for they would get to tingling whenever danger was near, just as they were tingling now.
“This doesn’t seem right,” she grumbled, her voice hoarse and scratchy from years of freeweed abuse. She peered through the lens of her scopic copper tube which was balanced upon a stick. From her perch high in the strata of a sandstone cliff, she could pick out the riders of a distant merchant caravan, and could count their number all the way back to the rear of their column. 
“Seventy-two... and there’s something unnatural about them,” Pella said.  “I don’t think we should go for it.”
Ayram was standing next to her, taller by at least two feet. He was a giant of a man but skinny, and all his limbs were wrapped tight in wool and leather as if to accentuate his ganglyness. He was stroking his scraggly beard as he tracked Pella’s gaze.
“What do you mean ‘something unnatural’?” he asked.  
With his vision unaided, Ayram could only make out the dust cloud kicked up by the distant caravan - it billowed high into the air and shone brightly as the early morning light picked it out against the darker blue of the fleeing night sky. 
“There’s an odd fix about them.” Pella said.
“An odd fix? You’ve counted seventy-two. That’s exactly how many Salavan said there’d be, and they’re coming along at exactly the right time and place.”
“I don’t doubt your man in Jeket. But still, something is off.”
Ayram kept silent to give Pella time to study their quarry, for it would be stupid to ignore the mood of a woman whose misgivings had saved them several times before.
“It’s the way they ride,” Pella concluded. She moved aside to let Ayram peer through the scope. “Have you ever seen a caravan guard ride three by three like that?” she asked. 
Ayram bent down on one knee and put his eye to the rim of the brass eyepiece. The wagons and their guard quickly came into focus.
“No,” he replied. 
“I don’t think we should go for it,” Pella repeated.
Ayram shrugged her off and took a moment to absorb the details. 
There were eight wagons, several more than the average for a gold train, and the tight discipline of the riders made it easy to count their number; three by three as Pella had said. Hardly the ragged band of backwash from the Empire’s conquests that passed for caravan hands this far out. Ayram couldn’t make out any insignia or marks that might identify them as professional soldiers. Still, they were quite far out on the Junei plain, and Pella’s old scope was a little dusty. 
Ayram compared what he saw to the lay of the ambush that he had set up below. It seemed the most ideal spot to bushwhack such a heavily guarded merchant caravan. It was one of the few short and straight ravines through which a road actually passed. Its slopes were steep so his people would have a clean shot at the whole column, provided all seventy-two and all eight wagons could fit inside. Though there were few trees, there were plenty of boulders and prickly brown bushes for cover. The ends of the ravine were easy enough to manage with chains buried in the sand, which when tugged through pulleys bolted into the rocks, would burst upwards and trap their quarry in.
Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. 
Against experienced warriors, Ayram was not so sure.
“If they weren’t wearing that woolen garb I’d take them for Imperial cavalry,” Ayram said.
        “It could be that they’ve been drilling common hands,” Pella suggested.
        “That could be.”
“Or, it could be that those really are Imperial riders.”
“But they’re wrapped in white wool.”
“Sure, sure. But I’m wrapped in wool and I’m Imperial. Used to be anyways,” Pella said.
“An Imperial priestess, not an officer,” Ayram corrected. “Officers don’t drop their company’s colors for convenience. Even in the desert.”
Pella just laughed. “The Sand makes converts of us all, Ayram. Uniforms be damned.” At that she spit off the side of the cliff and watched it fall. It swayed a little in the cool breeze and landed fifty yards below, where the boy Sendren was stringing his helmwood bow. Sendren looked up at Pella and muttered a curse, but Pella just shook her head and pointed up above her, innocently directing Sendren’s ire towards Relsa who was perched atop the cliff.
“The point of a uniform isn’t comfort,” Ayram said. “For them it’s hardly even for protection.  It’s about distinction.” 
“Sure, sure. But still,” Pella said.
“Yes,” Ayram relented, “they could be fighting men.”
“They could be rabble, they could be Imperials. Would it change your call?” Pella asked, thinking she knew the answer.
“If they are Imperial then they’ll have skin in the game.”
“They won’t run when the killing starts,” Pella said, finishing his thought.
“And the way we’re set up…”
        “This only works if they run.”
“Well… it’s only completely safe if they run.” 
“So it’s off then.”
Ayram took a moment once more to eye the caravan through Pella’s scope, trying to find some detail that might still swing his decision. 
The information he’d been given was accurate - the caravan was here as predicted. He and his people were eager, rested, and ready. Smooth sandstone boulders were levered and the tripline fittings were set. The long shadows of the rising sun would keep them hidden until the most opportune moment. There was even the off chance that the witch’s magic might work. Most importantly, their way into and out of the ravine was a hidden crevasse which remained unknown to the Empire, and every day that Ayram delayed he risked its discovery. If found, this stretch of the Junei would be closed to thieves forever.
“Disciplined riders aren’t enough to call this off,” Ayram finally decided, and handed the glass back to Pella. 
“Then should I whistle the boys?” Pella asked, looking a little grim - a look which came quite easy for her.
“Yes,” Ayram replied. “Be sure to stab and flutter it. We need a little extra caution.”
 Pella nodded, then put her hands to her mouth and whistled the song of the Jade Tresset to let the men know that the ambush was on, and she stabbed and fluttered the high notes, as Ayram had directed.
Ayram waited a bit for twittered replies to spring from his people’s hiding spots, and then he squeezed his giant frame into the little cave behind him.


Cloistered within the cramped space was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, ten years younger than Pella, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Ayram, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sundrenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree.  Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The beast was belly up, and her fingers were knuckle deep in it’s guts, twisting and twirling as her lips whispered incantations and her eyes searched the pink sliver of morning sky that peeked through the crack in the rocks above.
“It’s almost time,” Ayram warned.
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, though she did not take her eyes off the sky, nor her hand from the lizard’s corpse.
        “What thing is more vital than blood?” she asked the world. 
“Blood cold as ice…” 
She pushed down with the palm of her hand to squeeze acids out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Blood hot as a raging fire….” 
She squeezed the intestinal organs with her knotted fingers. 
“We would be gods if not for blood…”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up.
“We would be dust without it.” 
Elrahet then threw the entrails down, back into the body cavity, and stared intently at whatever was going on within.
When nothing happened, Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.
Its belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched, and its tail curled. Ayram supposed that the thing was somehow still alive. When she finally pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh, it went completely limp.
“It is possible,” Elrahet said to Ayram in a quiet whisper so that none outside could hear, “that the beast is infertile.” 
“So this won’t work?” Ayram asked as he knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Ayram spread apart the lizard’s corpse. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines seemed to writhe and pulse like a knotted mass of worms. 
He was impressed.
“Well... it was worth a try,” he said.
Elrahet hissed at his dubiety. “I just need fertile blood. Fresh fertile blood,” she stressed.
        Ayram thought for a moment, then pulled up his sleeve and extended his hairy brown arm towards Elrahet.
        “I won’t carve you open,” Elrahet croaked. “Get me one of the Pazard boys or something.”
        “There’s no time. It’s either me or Pella... Or no one.” 
        “That old Imperial sow isn’t fertile.”
        “Well then,” Ayram said, extending his arm further.
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given by one Jandrian to another. Elrahet had been Ayram’s witch for years and he had never offered a drop to her. She tried to gauge his countenance to see if he was sincere - but his face was set deep in the shadow of his hood and his eyes were sunk back behind bushy brows. His beard hid whatever slight expression his lips might reveal. Even clean shaven and in direct light, the difference between his smile and a frown was almost imperceptible. 
She looked down at his arm and eyed the veins that bulged under the skin. She knew his blood would be potent. 
“We can do this without you,” Ayram said with more than a hint of impatience.
At that, Elrahet pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from her bag and laid them between herself and Ayram. Then she unsheathed a patterned blade from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise to Ayram’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said.
“And I yours,” Ayram replied. 
Elrahet savored his courtesy with a near-toothless grin, then eagerly plunged her dagger’s tip into his flesh. She flicked her wrist with expert care and opened the vein. Ayram remained unstirred, watching with serious intent as blood bubbled out of the wound and ran around his wrist in a steady stream to drip into the bowl.
 When he had enough, he jerked his arm free.
“That’s it.” He said. 
The bowl was just half full.
“Your gift is humbling, but if that is it… don’t expect much,” Elrahet grumbled.
“I did say that we can do this without you.”
Elrahet scowled, then took the bowl and began to flick Ayram’s blood onto the lizard’s corpse, careful to make sure that not a drop hit the dirt.
Ayram reached out to take the yard of linen to dress his wound. Then as he tried to maneuver his hips round so he could leave, he bumped Elrahet. 
“Get out of here!” she snapped. 
Ayram laughed as he did.




The first signs of Elrahet’s magic were the wispy vapor trails that circulated high in the atmosphere above her cave. They twirled and danced, driven by unnatural purpose, though they were so slight that they could hardly be said to be there at all. By the time Ayram sat down at his hiding spot behind a couple of small boulders on the northern slope of the ravine, the trails had begun to congeal into something thicker.
Soon the wind picked up and began to brush them into form, and it blew a pleasant musk of earthy, humid air down into the ravine. If Ayram had not been looking for it, he might not have noticed how a light fog subtly shifting into existence. Just as he began to wonder if the crew had taken notice, a low rolling drum of distant thunder echoed through the valley, though there was, as yet, no great storm from which it could have come.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papillian excitedly. The boy was stationed behind a boulder closer to the road. Ayram glared down at him with sufficient sternness to shush him. He didn’t blame the lad for the outburst as this was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of magic.
It was perhaps too good. The merchant caravan was still far out. Perhaps they had not yet made it into the valley’s fingers. Perhaps they could see the cyclonic flow of haze that now swirled above Elrahet’s cave. Still, Ayram half expected that it all might fizzle out - humans made for poor magicians - but all his doubts were allayed when dense clouds began to creep out from some invisible fissure in the sky.
They crept out slowly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. Once they were out over the ravine they began to feed, to chew and swallow the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the lizard that Elrahet had prepared. 
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, just little pricklings on the skin, just a light peppering of the sandy rocks and clay. The drizzle cleansed the air of the desert dust that was ever present in the Sand, the stuff that clogged the nose and scratched the throat. In fact the air was so crisp that this was the first time in forever that Ayram could take in a full, clean breath. It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.
More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Ayram found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all.  
At least the earth seemed to enjoy it, parched and desiccated as it was. It took its time to drink its fill. It filtered the water through sand and silt and then trickled it down into the deep reservoirs of the world. It savoured every drop, and it drank slowly, which meant that it did not take long for the surface to become soaked. Soon rain began to pitter-patter into puddles, and water ran down the ravine, seeking out the familiar routes that it had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millenia. Where once there were cracks, pits, and sinks in the rock and clay, there were now streams and cascades. Where once there were depressions and scars, there were now pools in which desert life would find succor.
Ayram looked over to the young Papillian. Though the rain was rare and precious on this side of the Junei Mountains, the boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers. He might as well have been swimming. 
He muttered a curse, and the storm cursed back.


CRACK-BOOM!


A bright and gnarled flash of lightning split the dark sky above. 
It hit somewhere near in the cliffs behind them.
Everyone jumped.
“Elra’s never conjured more than foggy mist!” Papillian exclaimed.
Colm, a beastly man to Papillian’s side could be heard as well. “Bit much innit?”
Ayram disagreed.  By this point the valley road was getting good and slick and muddy. Laden wagons would have to be dragged through it. They would be moving slowly, if they would move at all - though that was cause for some concern. They might not even make it into the ravine. Or, they might have turned around and fled the valley as soon as the first showers hit them.
 Then a faint horse’s whinny pierced the splashing of the rain. 
Ayram turned his gaze southward. There he could just make out the shapes of white horses coming round the bend. Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Ayram could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.
Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Ayram expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.
Ayram would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn’t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers’ turbans. They were each, to a man, Roman[a]. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.
Ayram's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Ayram felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.
By the time the middle of column had reached Ayram’s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.
 The dead rider’s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 
So began the battle.
Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Ayram had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. 
Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.
 An officer’s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Ayram. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. 
They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.
Ayram eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party’s arrows from whittling them down one by one.
Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his hands began to glow.
Ayram notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. 
Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. 


CRACK-BOOM!


A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Ayram back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. 
Then things went black.
        
_______


        Getting your skull caved in is the worst way to lose track of time. Next worst is a night of fitful sleep, but of course that doesn’t compare. Sleep can be said to be a lived experience inasmuch as one’s dreams are remembered.  Even without them, the passage of time is always somehow estimated so that as soon as you step out of bed there is that sublime sensation of being reinserted into the natural flow of things - not so with a knockout blow.
More to the point, there’s the pain.
        When Ayram came to, there was a dull, throbbing ache that radiated out from the top of his head where the rock had cracked open his skull. He brought his hand up to the wound and dabbed it gingerly with his fingers. They trembled upon a smattering of dried blood which had matted his hair. He then continued to follow the pain to its source, near the crown of his skull. There he found that he could push down on a flap of skin and a cracked bit of bone. As he traced the outline of the cavity, a sharp pain shot out and ran around to the back of his head, constricting his skull like a python. 
        He must have been out for hours. Maybe days. He had no way of knowing 
Oddly, it was still raining.
        “You’re awake!”
        It was old Pella. She rushed to his side.
        “We were set up!” she said.
        “What?” Ayram asked, confused even as to how he was alive.
“It was a setup! There was no gold!” Her raspy voice was quivering with excitement and rage.
Ayram tried to blink the blur out of his vision. He was in a cave somewhere high in the mountains.
“How long was I out?”, he asked.
“For the better part of a day… There was no gold, Ayram.” 
Ayram winced, half in pain, half in exasperation.
“What happened?” he asked.
“That storm that Elrahet magic’d up conjured a bolt… bigger than any I’ve ever seen... it took out the entire caravan. It took out Papillian and Colm, too, and nearly you. But that magus survived!” Pella pointed to the naked figure who lay crumpled and unconscious near the cave’s mouth. His pale body was covered in black glyphs and arcane symbols. Blood pooled around him.
“He has not yet awoken. I haven’t told the boys yet, but he’s no mere magus. We cut
off his hands… I think he’s one of the Emperor’s Salisians,” Pella said. “Only four Salisians in the world, and one of them is here... He was here to kill us! Ayram, we were set up!”
Ayram struggled to take it all in.
“Who was your man in Jeket?!” Pella asked, stressing the urgency of the moment. 
“Who baited us into this?”
Ayram closed his eyes and gritted his teeth.
“A man named Salavan Saran.”

            <Text>Existence precedes essence
For example, it belongs to the essence of a house to keep the bad weather out, which is why it has walls and a roof. Humans are different from houses because—unlike houses—they do not have an inbuilt purpose: they are free to choose their own purpose and thereby shape their essence; thus, their existence precedes their essence 

Some interpret the imperative to define oneself as meaning that anyone can wish to be anything. However, an existentialist philosopher would say such a wish constitutes an inauthentic existence – what Sartre would call &quot;bad faith&quot;. Instead, the phrase should be taken to say that people are defined only insofar as they act and that they are responsible for their actions. Someone who acts cruelly towards other people is, by that act, defined as a cruel person. Such persons are themselves responsible for their new identity (cruel persons). This is opposed to their genes, or human nature, bearing the blame. 


The craft of the self
- the first is the relationships between yourself and others. You are defined by these relationships - the more you struggle against this the more you are defined.

Thrownness (German: Geworfenheit)[1] is a concept introduced by German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889–1976) to describe humans' individual existences as being 'thrown' (geworfen) into the world. 

Socratic irony is &quot;the dissimulation of ignorance practised by Socrates as a means of confuting an adversary&quot;.[12] Socrates would pretend to be ignorant of the topic under discussion, to draw out the inherent nonsense in the arguments of his interlocutors. The Chambers Dictionary defines it as &quot;a means by which a questioner pretends to know less than a respondent, when actually he knows more&quot;. 

This can be more easily understood when considering facticity in relation to the temporal dimension of our past: one's past is what one is, in that it co-constitutes oneself. However, to say that one is only one's past would ignore a significant part of reality (the present and the future), while saying that one's past is only what one was, would entirely detach it from oneself now. A denial of one's concrete past constitutes an inauthentic lifestyle, and also applies to other kinds of facticity (having a human body—e.g., one that does not allow a person to run faster than the speed of sound—identity, values, etc. 

Facticity is a limitation and a condition of freedom. It is a limitation in that a large part of one's facticity consists of things one did not choose (birthplace, etc.), but a condition of freedom in the sense that one's values most likely depend on it. However, even though one's facticity is &quot;set in stone&quot; (as being past, for instance), it cannot determine a person: the value ascribed to one's facticity is still ascribed to it freely by that person. As an example, consider two men, one of whom has no memory of his past and the other who remembers everything. Both have committed many crimes, but the first man, remembering nothing, leads a rather normal life while the second man, feeling trapped by his own past, continues a life of crime, blaming his own past for &quot;trapping&quot; him in this life. There is nothing essential about his committing crimes, but he ascribes this meaning to his past.
However, to disregard one's facticity during the continual process of self-making, projecting oneself into the future, would be to put oneself in denial of oneself and would be inauthentic. The origin of one's projection must still be one's facticity, though in the mode of not being it (essentially). An example of one focusing solely on possible projects without reflecting on one's current facticity:[40] would be someone who continually thinks about future possibilities related to being rich (e.g. a better car, bigger house, better quality of life, etc.) without acknowledging the facticity of not currently having the financial means to do so. In this example, considering both facticity and transcendence, an authentic mode of being would be considering future projects that might improve one's current finances (e.g. putting in extra hours, or investing savings) in order to arrive at a future-facticity of a modest pay rise, further leading to purchase of an affordable car.

 &quot;mimicry&quot; where one acts as &quot;one should&quot; 

A critical claim in existentialist thought is that individuals are always free to make choices and guide their lives towards their own chosen goal or &quot;project&quot;. This claim suggests that individuals cannot escape this freedom, even in overwhelming circumstances. For instance, even an empire's colonized victims possess choices: to submit to rule, to negotiate, to commit suicide, to resist nonviolently, or to counter-attack. 

Although external circumstances may limit individuals (this limitation from the outside is called facticity), they cannot force a person to follow one of the remaining courses over another. In this sense the individual still has some freedom of choice. For this reason, an individual may choose in anguish, fully aware that this will have consequences. For Sartre, to claim that one amongst many conscious possibilities takes undeniable precedence (for instance, &quot;I cannot risk my life, because I must support my family&quot;) is to assume the role of an object in the world, not a free agent, but merely at the mercy of circumstance (a being-in-itself that is only its own facticity, i.e., it &quot;is&quot; inside itself, and acts there as a limitation).[2] For Sartre, this attitude is manifestly self-deceiving. 

According to this philosophy, humans are always aware that they are more than what they are aware of. In other words, they are not whatever they are aware of. In this sense, humans cannot be defined as &quot;intentional objects&quot; of consciousness that includes the restrictions imposed by facticity, personal history, character, bodies, or objective responsibility. Thus, as Sartre often repeated, &quot;Human reality is what it is not, and it is not what it is.&quot; An example of what he means is being a doctor but wishing to &quot;transcend&quot; that to become a pig farmer. One is who one is not: a pig farmer, not who one is, a doctor.
One can only define oneself negatively, as &quot;what it is not&quot;, and this negation is the only positive definition of &quot;what it is.&quot;[3]
From this we are aware of a host of alternative reactions to our freedom to choose an objective situation, since no situation can dictate a single response. We pretend that these possibilities are denied to us by assuming social roles and value systems external to this nature[clarification needed]. But this is itself a decision made possible by our freedom and our separation from these things.
&quot;Bad faith&quot; is the paradoxical free decision to deny to ourselves this inescapable freedom.

Sartre cites a café waiter, whose movements and conversation are a little too &quot;waiter-esque&quot;. His voice oozes with an eagerness to please; he carries food rigidly and ostentatiously;&quot;his movement is quick and forward, a little too precise, a little too rapid&quot;.[4] His exaggerated behaviour illustrates that he is play-acting as a waiter, as an object in the world: an automaton whose essence is to be a waiter. But that he is obviously acting belies that he is aware that he is not (merely) a waiter, but is rather consciously deceiving himself.[5]
Another of Sartre's examples involves a young woman on a first date. She ignores the obvious sexual implications of her date's compliments to her physical appearance, but accepts them instead as words directed at her as a human consciousness. As he takes her hand, she lets it rest indifferently in his, &quot;neither consenting nor resisting – a thing&quot;[6] – refusing either to return the gesture or to rebuke it. Thus she delays the moment when she must choose either to acknowledge and reject his advances, or consent to them. She conveniently considers her hand only a thing in the world, and his compliments as unrelated to her body, playing on her dual human reality as a physical being, and as a consciousness separate and free from this physicality.[7]
Sartre suggests that by acting in bad faith the waiter and the woman are denying their own freedom, by using their freedom to do so. They manifestly know they are free, but are actively choosing not to acknowledge it. Bad faith is paradoxical in this regard: when acting in bad faith, a person is actively denying their own freedom, while relying on it to perform the denial.

De Beauvoir described three main types of women acting in bad faith: the Narcissist who denies her freedom by construing herself as a desirable object; the Mystic, who invests her freedom in an absolute; and the Woman in Love, who submerges her identity in that of her male object.[8]
She also considered what she called the Serious Man, who subordinated himself to some outside cause, to be in bad faith inasmuch as he denies his own freedom

Dostoyevsky
The narrator observes that utopian society removes suffering and pain, but man desires both things and needs them in order to be happy. He argues that removing pain and suffering in society takes away a man's freedom. He says that the cruelty of society 
 human beings moan about pain only to spread their suffering to others. 

 one cannot avoid the simple fact that anyone, at any time, can decide to act in a way that might not be considered to be in their own self-interest; some will do so simply to validate their existence and to protest and confirm that they exist as individuals. The Underground Man ridicules the type of enlightened self-interest that Chernyshevsky proposes as the foundation of Utopian society. The idea of cultural and legislative systems relying on this rational egoism is what the protagonist despises. The Underground Man embraces this ideal in praxis, and seems to blame it for his current state of unhappiness.[6] 

 I am forty years old now, and you know forty years is a whole lifetime; you know it is extreme old age. To live longer than forty years is bad manners, is vulgar, immoral. Who does live beyond forty? Answer that, sincerely and honestly I will tell you who do: fools and worthless fellows. I tell all old men that to their face, all these venerable old men, all these silver-haired and reverend seniors! I tell the whole world that to its face! I have a right to say so, for I shall go on living to sixty myself. To seventy! To eighty! ... Stay, let me take breath ... 

My room is a wretched, horrid one in the outskirts of the town. My servant is an old country-woman, ill-natured from stupidity, and, moreover, there is always a nasty smell about her. I am told that the Petersburg climate is bad for me, and that with my small means it is very expensive to live in Petersburg. I know all that better than all these sage and experienced counsellors and monitors.... But I am remaining in Petersburg; I am not going away from Petersburg! I am not going away because ... ech! Why, it is absolutely no matter whether I am going away or not going away. 

conscious that that day I had committed a loathsome action again, that what was done could never be undone, and secretly, inwardly gnawing, gnawing at myself for it, tearing and consuming myself till at last the bitterness turned into a sort of shameful accursed sweetness, and at last—into positive real enjoyment! Yes, into enjoyment, into enjoyment! I insist upon that. I have spoken of this because I keep wanting to know for a fact whether other people feel such enjoyment? I will explain; the enjoyment was just from the too intense consciousness of one’s own degradation; it was from feeling oneself that one had reached the last barrier, that it was horrible, but that it could not be otherwise; that there was no escape for you; that you never could become a different man; that even if time and faith were still left you to change into something different you would most likely not wish to change; or if you did wish to, even then you would do nothing; because perhaps in reality there was nothing for you to change into. 

With people who know how to revenge themselves and to stand up for themselves in general, how is it done? Why, when they are possessed, let us suppose, by the feeling of revenge, then for the time there is nothing else but that feeling left in their whole being. Such a gentleman simply dashes straight for his object like an infuriated bull with its horns down, and nothing but a wall will stop him. Well, such a direct person I regard as the real normal man, as his tender mother nature wished to see him when she graciously brought him into being on the earth. I envy such a man till I am green in the face. He is stupid. I am not disputing that, but perhaps the normal man should be stupid, how do you know? Perhaps it is very beautiful, in fact. And I am the more persuaded of that suspicion, if one can call it so, by the fact that if you take, for instance, the antithesis of the normal man, that is, the man of acute consciousness, who has come, of course, not out of the lap of nature but out of a retort (this is almost mysticism, gentlemen, but I suspect this, too), this retort-made man is sometimes so nonplussed in the presence of his antithesis that with all his exaggerated consciousness he genuinely thinks of himself as a mouse and not a man.  

The base and nasty desire to vent that spite on its assailant rankles perhaps even more nastily in it than in l’homme de la nature et de la vérité. For through his innate stupidity the latter looks upon his revenge as justice pure and simple; while in consequence of his acute consciousness the mouse does not believe in the justice of it.  

here in its nasty, stinking, underground home our insulted, crushed and ridiculed mouse promptly becomes absorbed in cold, malignant and, above all, everlasting spite. For forty years together it will remember its injury down to the smallest, most ignominious details, and every time will add, of itself, details still more ignominious, spitefully teasing and tormenting itself with its own imagination. It will itself be ashamed of its imaginings, but yet it will recall it all, it will go over and over every detail, it will invent unheard of things against itself, pretending that those things might happen, and will forgive nothing. 

 in that hell of unsatisfied desires turned inward, in that fever of oscillations, of resolutions determined for ever and repented of again a minute later—that the savour of that strange enjoyment of which I have spoken lies. It is so subtle, so difficult of analysis, that persons who are a little limited, or even simply persons of strong nerves, will not understand a single atom of it. “Possibly,” you will add on your own account with a grin, “people will not understand it either who have never received a slap in the face,” and in that way you will politely hint to me that I, too, perhaps, have had the experience of a slap in the face in my life, and so I speak as one who knows. I bet that you are thinking that. But set your minds at rest, gentlemen, I have not received a slap in the face, though it is absolutely a matter of indifference to me what you may think about it. Possibly, I even regret, myself, that I have given so few slaps in the face during my life. But enough ... not another word on that subject of such extreme interest to you. 

His moans become nasty, disgustingly malignant, and go on for whole days and nights. And of course he knows himself that he is doing himself no sort of good with his moans; he knows better than anyone that he is only lacerating and harassing himself and others for nothing; he knows that even the audience before whom he is making his efforts, and his whole family, listen to him with loathing, do not put a ha’porth of faith in him, and inwardly understand that he might moan differently, more simply, without trills and flourishes, and that he is only amusing himself like that from ill-humour, from malignancy. Well, in all these recognitions and disgraces it is that there lies a voluptuous pleasure. As though he would say: “I am worrying you, I am lacerating your hearts, I am keeping everyone in the house awake. Well, stay awake then, you, too, feel every minute that I have toothache. I am not a hero to you now, as I tried to seem before, but simply a nasty person, an impostor. Well, so be it, then! I am very glad that you see through me. It is nasty for you to hear my despicable moans: well, let it be nasty; here I will let you have a nastier flourish in a minute....” You do not understand even now, gentlemen? No, it seems our development and our consciousness must go further to understand all the intricacies of this pleasure. You laugh? Delighted. My jests, gentlemen, are of course in bad taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence. But of course that is because I do not respect myself. 

Can a man of perception respect himself at all? 

well, for instance, to take offence simply on purpose, for nothing; and one knows oneself, of course, that one is offended at nothing; that one is putting it on, but yet one brings oneself at last to the point of being really offended. All my life I have had an impulse to play such pranks, so that in the end I could not control it in myself.

People need a narrative or else they cannot survive. Post-modernism provides a narrative of power. 

Schopenhauer - for whence did dante take the materials of his hell but from our actual world. And he made a very proper hell out of it. But when, on the other hand, when he came to describe heaven and its delights, he had an insurmountable difficulty before him, for our world provides no materials at all for t his.

	- They’re kalemites.
	- point out femur. They’re cannibals. Only brand of creature that would do such a thing would be a kalemite. Rest of it fits when you think about it. Imperials out on random patrol in the sandslants? Stationed here??? No flags, no shrine to sol, no sentries, etc.


Femur split down the middle - “THats a human femur. Look at the fracture down the middle. That’s a very unusual fracture. I’ve seen material like this in late glacial sites.

The sirono, Holmberg reported,were amongst the most culturally backward people of the world. Living in constant want and hunger, they had no clothes, no domestic animals, no musical instruments (not even rattles and drums), no art or design, and almost no religion, (the sirono ‘conception of the universe was almost completelhy uncrystallized . Incredibly, they could not count beyond three or make fire (they carried it, he wrote, form camp to camp in a burning brand.) their poor lean tos, made of haphazardly heaped palm fronds, were so ineffective against rain andinsects that the typical band membe undergoes many a sleepless night during the year. Crouched over meager campfires during the wet, buggy nights, the siriono were living exemplars of primitive humankind, the quintessence of ‘man in the raw state of nature’. Then they encountered european society and for the first timetheir history acquired a narrative flow.
Good guy, efforts to alleviate poverty in the andes, but he was wrong.
Believed the land had no real history.
Siriono were among the most culturally impovereshed people on earth. But this was not because they were unchanged holdovers from humankind’s ancient past, but because smallpox and influenza laid waste to their villages in the 1920s.
Then hunted by bolivian gov. 
It was as if holmberg stumbled upon nazi concentration camp and just assumed that they had always lived that way.

In our day, beliefs about indians inherent simplicity and innocence refer mainly to their putative lack of impact on the envorionment. This notion dates back to thoreau, who spent much time seeking “Indian wisdom”, an ingeneous way of thought that supposedly did not encompass measuring or categorizing, which he viewed as the evils that allowed human beings to change Nature.

“Keep America Beautiful” indian cying. Indians were playing a heroic role, emboidied holmberg’s Mistake, for it implicitly depicted indians as people who never changed their environment from its original wild state. Because history is change, they were people without history.

Called them indians by mistake.  Still call them indians.

Stone breakwaters and long-prowed reed boats.

Wari was a dense, alley-packed craze of walled-off temples, hidden courtyards, royal tombs, and apartments up to six stories tall. Sheathed in white plaster, sparkling in the mountain sun.

Cahokia - by mining the forests upstream for firewood and floating the logs downriver to the city, they were removing ground cover and increasing the likelihood of catastrophic floods. When these came, as they later did, kings faced angry questioning from their subjects.

A tumult of languages, trade, and culture, a region where tens of millions of people loved and hated and worshipped. Much of this world vanished after columbus, swept away by disease and subjugation. So thorough was the erasure that within a few generations neither conqueror nor conquered knew that this world had existed.

Samoset and tisquantum spoke with the colonists for about an hour. Perhaps they then gave a signal, or perhaps massasoit was simply following a prearranged schedule. In any case, he and the rest of the indian party appeared without warning at the crest of a hill on the south bank of the creek that ran through the foreigners’ camp. Alarmed by massasoit’s sudden entrance, the europeans withdrew to the hill on the opposite bank, where they had emplaced their few cannons behind a half-finished stockade a standoff ensued. 
Finally winslow eschibited the decisiveness that later led to his selection as colony governor. Wearing a full suit of armor and acrrying a sword, he waded through th e stream and offered himself as a hostage. Tisquantum, who walked with him, served as interpreter.massasoit’s brother took charge of winslow and then massasoit crossed the water himself, followed by tisquantum and twenty of massasoit’s men, all ostenatiously unarmed. The colonists took the sachem to an unfinished house and gave him some cushoins to recline on . Both sides shared some of the foreigners homemade moonshine, then sttled down to talk.
Deerskin shawl and leggins . Face covered with bug-reppelling oil and reddish-purple dye. Around his neck hung a pouch of tobacco, a long knife, and a thick chain of prized white shell beads.

The indians were seen as trivial, ineffectual patsies.
But when you look at the historical record, it’s clear that indians were trying to control their own destinies, and often ehough they csucceeded - only to learn, as all peoples do, that the consequenceswere not what they expected.

Stared up at the diddering shadows of the hemp bags and bark boxes hanging from the rafters. Voices would skirl up in the darkness; one person singing lullaby then another person, until everyone was asleep. 

Outside the wetu he would hear the cheerful thuds of the large mortars and pestles in which women cushed dried maize into nokake, a flour-like powder “so sweet, thoothsome, and hearty, that an indian will travel many days with no other but this meal.

To master the art of ignoring pain, future pniese had to subject themselves to such miserable experiences ar running barelegged through brambles. And they fasted often, to learn self-discipline. After spending their winter in the woods, pniese candidates came back to an additional test: drinking bitter gentian juice until they vomited, repeating this bulimic process over and over until near fainting, they threw up blood.

Captured men were often tortured (they were admired, though not necessarily spared, if they endured the pain stoically).

Amiable to behold.

As a rule, young men wore it long on one side, in an equine mane, but cropped the othe side short, which prevented it form getting tangled in their bow strings. But sometimes they cut their hair into such wild patterns that attempting to imitate them, wood sniffed, wowuld torture the wits of a curious barber.tonsures, pigtails, head completely shaved but for a single forelock, long sides drawn into a queue with a raffish short-cut roach in the middle, all of it was prideful and abhorrent to the pilgrims.

Things on the horizon are always further away then they appear. Law of perspective. Distances get compressed the further away from you they are.

Leftists are still people. You still have narcissists, attention seekers and just generally people who don't delve too deeply into anything and just repeat whatever the previous person is saying.
Moralism specifically avoids putting the effort into understanding how things work and just lets you make a moral judgement which might elicit positive reactions from your peers. If you want that kind of attention, screaming 'eat the rich' and so on is an easy way to get group approval. Just human brain at play.
It's unavoidable and is not related to politics, just how humans are. Nobody is immune. I can share a lot of my own frustrations with leftists but I doubt it is unique to left-leaning thinking, although sometimes the hypocrisy can be frustrating.

            <Title>Seculla home life</Title>
            <Text>Danserd tells Gilgamesh story to Seculla. Trying to use scripture to get her to chill the fuck out.

The Shalda continent is a big crescent slab of anthracite rock that tilts down into the strait of Hormuz like a sinking ship. The continent’s gradual slope is not something that’s noticed by most of the people living there. You can’t see it with the naked eye. The land is just too big. All folk see is the local river tumbling downhill. And these are hardscrabble folk who move from task to task, people who, according to the mind of Danserd Fark, only know things of immediate utility. Danserd didn’t begrudge them their ignorance. He knew that it takes a person blessed with a life of leisure and wealth to travel to every corner of the continent, to map its major rivers, and then to wonder why they all flow in the same direction: North. 
The slope is most starkly seen if you start at sea level on a northern Shalda beach and then travel due south to one of the Hrkkan cliff cities that face the open ocean. Over the course of half a year you’ll have ascended 1,000 leagues. Danserd had made the journey over twenty times. Only four of those times he was on official ambassadorial business. In times of late he no business other than sating his desire to discover new and fascinating kinds of plants. 
Plants, trees, grasses - the more Danserd looked the more he saw how the edges between these things was not so clear as it seemed. They were the key, he thought, to unlocking the truth behind so many mysteries, and first among these was question of Life itself; what is it?
Are plants alive? Not everyone agrees. 
Danserd would ask this question to almost everyone he met, and generally speaking, people would say yes, plants are living creatures. They share so many of the attributes that intuitively define Life. 
Living things move. Plants move. They don’t seem to move, but Danserd had taken the time to watch them. Their roots burrow inquiringly into the earth, their buds and twigs swing in definite arcs chasing the sun. In the space of one afternoon he’d seen a vine-tendril circle around three times in a questioning arc, searching for something to latch on to.
Living things grow. Plants grow. This point is obvious.
Living things drink water. Plants drink water. This is a bit of the ‘utility knowledge’ of hardscrabble folk. In all Danserd’s travels he found that no one was knew more about just how much water a certain plant needed, and moreover, what kind of water, as there are, for example, various weeds in the that thirst for a salty brine. These bulbous plants had different uses. Pickleweed. 
Living things have children. Plants have children. A seed is no different than egg. To reinforce this point, Danserd never used the word ‘seed’. He’d say, “the oak’s eggs” instead of “the oak’s acorns”, and he’d talk about the thing giving birth. But also because it annoyed his wife, Seculla.
Living things eat. Do plants eat? Danserd believed that they did. In his magnificent garden he’d planted some species of jackweed in pots that were filled with dark, loamy soil, the kind typical of the temperate valley of Hrk. Over the course of several months the potted soil started to brown. The jackweeds started to sag and its many stems started to limp. When Danserd re-potted the thing into fresh soil, it perked right back up again. Danserd knew this wasn’t proof, but it was a suggestion, nonetheless, that on the tips of the jackweed’s roots were little mouths that were sucking up not just water but food.
Living things kill. This was a point raised by a shalzi slave that Danserd met in Agrahbah. To eat, one has to kill. This simple fact was woven into the man’s cosmogony: the twinned creator gods were a capricious bunch. Story of God creating man as a cruel trick: His punishment: To eat you must kill a living thing. One cannot get sustenance from a rock. 
The slave’s accord was thus; because plants are eaten, then they must be alive.
Danserd then asked this slave the obvious question: if plants are alive, then they must be killing and eating as well, so what are plants killing? 
The slave said it was all a big circle, that the plants are killing and eating us. All living things are supposed to be immortal. But the plants are poisoning the air and then they feast on our corpses when we die. Birds, beasts, and beetles too. 
The man was a dog worshiper. He would feed his dead relatives to packs of dogs. The idea was to keep their corpses out of the ground and out of the reach of roots. He’d grind whatever bones were leftover into dust and then he tossed that into the dog’s water trough. Then he made bricks out of the feces.
Danserd had to consider it, because Humans do indeed kill to eat, as do all manner of beasts. It certainly seems that killing is a fact of life. 
There are certain Solean sects that say no. They say that life requires a measure of the spark, and plants lack awareness.
Then there are Jandri folk how claim that plants are not alive because they do not breathe. Breath is the sign of life. 

Breathing - fish breathe different substance, gives him the idea that plants breathe sunlight.

Danserd thought that plants were the most interesting thing about the journey up the Great Slope of Shalda. He’d first have to travel south from always start deep south, to the Hrkkan highlands, were nothing grows taller than a footshrub because nothing can survive the winter if it grows above the snow drifts. Just north of that are the sparse woodlands of aspen and oak, and further north still is the belt of thick oak forest which stretches east and west across the whole continent. Further north still and the sun comes out and it gets hot enough in the summers to dry things out and spark fires, so the oaks forests cant compete with the fast growing grasses and fireproof palmettos. 
Then come the true lowlands, where swamp grasses and waterborne nuts 

“If you call it life,” Ralph continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. I can crush a rock with my hammer and I can crush a bug with my hammer, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. It’s the killing and the eating.” That last word rolled through Ralph’s beard like a saw.
“What about children?”
	“Trees eat children?”
“Fuck, no… Definition of life. Bugs have children, rocks don’t. That’s what makes a bug alive.”
“Cut a man’s balls off, what is he then? Dead? Just because he can’t have children?”
“He’s of a type that has children.”
Ralph just shrugged. “I say it’s killing. If these trees are alive, then that means they’re killing something. Could be it’s us. I heard once that we’re supposed to be immortal, and that the trees are poisoning the air to age us, so they can feast on our corpses when we die. We think we’re tending the orchard field but it’s really the orchard field tending to us!”
“Where the hell did you hear that?”
“From some pacified herd in the south. They’re mostly dead now. Dog worshippers the were. Fed their dead to packs of dogs to keep them out of the ground. Ground the bones to dust then tossed in with the water the dogs lapped up. Then they made bricks out of the feces.”
“No wonder you’re all …” Loopey
“You’ve always said I should contemplate more, so I’ve been contemplating. What do you think Eliza?”
“Living things can grow. Everything else can only waste away.”


My favourite part used to be taking off my clothes. Watching his pupils dilate. Eyes glaze over. Jaw going slightly slack. Breaths getting deeper. Both knowing what he wants.

Mazyd was here. Asking questions about you. You know they told me that these plants do eat. Sunlight.
They were askign about me?
Yes. They wanted to know about you.





Seculla and husband shol are having a pleasant conversation in a garden.

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Shes’ worried about how the vote will go today. You need to be there. Things will happen. Their trying to pin the disappearance of mazyd orzo on me.

Plant in garden same plant to subsume the god. ‘Look at this new one’.

Maybe talking about a certain plant with a certain effect that comes up later? Like glowing green jaw, you know the dude is chewing on shit.
Dude is cultivating drugs. 
Kind of a hippie shur.

‘Aide’ rushes into where Seculla and her husband Shol. Walking through the garden.

They’re meeting, without you. Trying to force it to a vote.
Come.

When she talks, she’s beautiful, when her face sits still her awkward features settle down all misshapen.

If you don’t like people, you should try plants
-solitary plant, struggling to grow, alone. Self-contained, really hits home how alone
-what is best in life? A barrow full of plants
-two peeps in a garden - right now there is a battle - plants fighting eachother

Well. To begin with, I don’t know how I did or when it first started. Because I didn’t realize it when it happened. But, somehow or another, I got the feeling that I would have a better time with younger people. Which I was havin a pretty good time. Until I realized it all had to come to an end. The way I realized that was to get a divorce. I don’think I could be married to a man like him.
Why is that?
Well he is a hard working man. And when someone makes love to me now, I want them to be affectionate and consoling, not just there to have sexual intercourse. And I have never had that. I think thats why I kind of turned against Dr. Graham. When I’m with him I’ll feel attracted towards him. Then he’ll say somethin that hits me the wrong way and I go to pieces. 


Mandrameen was a poet and Seculla was a trial lawyer.  The poet crafts verse and hopes that it will sing when played on the human heart, and the lawyer does the same, just does it more bluntly, with less rhyming and more certainty. Lives are at stake. “That’s the only real difference between us”, Seculla would say. That and the fact that a lawyer gets paid by the hour.
Often, when they laid together, Mandrameen would tease her about this. He’d say that if a lawyer is just a poet working for money, then a lawyer is no better than a whore. Money cheapens Virtue. A whore cheapens Love. A lawyer cheapens the Truth. He’d spank her on the bottom for effect.
Seculla would wave him off with her usual air of grace. She’d argue that there’s no such thing as the Truth. A single murder recounted by three different witnesses will result in three different stories. Unless there’s a bloody knife in hand we are all invincibly ignorant. Everything boils down to a he-said she-said, and everyone picks a side. You can’t blame them. It is only natural. Might as well get paid to do it.
It is little wonder that the two disagreed on how the Law should be structured. Mandrameen believed that morality was written on the hearts of men. He believed that Humans were endowed by Nature with natural rights. The Law should emanate from these and protect them. 
For Seculla, it didn’t matter what anyone thought the law should be, there’s only what it was: a practical thing for resolving the complexities of a dispute. It is subject to circumstance, politics, and power, and that’s all it will ever be. No one has anything by natural right. You only have what you can take for yourself. She’d say this right before grabbing a handful of Mandrameen’s ass - more for her own pleasure than effect. After all, the only law truly written on the heart is that of Self-Interest.
Perhaps if Seculla had been alive to see Ayram’s band, she might not have been so quick to doubt that Humanity has an intrinsic moral compass. Perhaps if Mandrameen had seen it, he might not have liked the direction that the compass's needle was pointing, for it didn’t point to Liberty or anything noble, it pointed to Ayram.

A genealogist proves to a prince that he is the direct descendant of a count whose relatives had mde  family pact three or for hundred years ago with a house whose very nme has left no memory. THis house had remote pretensions to a province whose last owner had just died of apoplexy. The prince and his council conclude without difficulty that the province belongs to him by divine right. THis province, which is some hundreds of leagues distant, protests in vain that it does not know him, that it has no wish to be governed by him, that one must at least have a people’s consent before legislateing for it. These discourses do not even reach the ears of the prince whose rights are incontestable. He immediately finds a great number of men who have nothing to do nor to lose. He dresses them in heavy blue cloth at 110 sous the ell, puts a heavy white cord round their hats, makes them turn left and right, and marches to glory.

Split up. They’ll be looking for, first of all, a giant - Ayram.
“I can move unseen if I wish.”
“How?” utter disbelief. “You are a head taller than the next tallest man I’ve seen.”
“Don’t worry about it.”
“It would do for everyone to change clothes at the earliest opportunity. Don’t want to look like shit.”

Ayram. “I’m coming with you.”
“You’ll draw too much attention.”
“I’ve sacrificed too much to let you slip through my fingers now.”
“You should worry about your own people, not me.”

Ayram paves the way. Whispers and stares. Good. Draws attention away from the lump on my back. Beggar.
“What’s your business?”
“Beer.”
“You wouldn’t happen to have some burgeon beer, would you?”
“Hah! Right.”
Ayram shoos a bunch away from a vat.

Pointing.
“Out.”
“Why? I didn’t do anything. Those buggers are still here, drinking.”
“You’re too big for my tavern.”
“It’s open vats. Pay upfront. Drink as much as you like. Ten copper lords per person. Except for you.” Points towards Ayram. “You’re too big. You’ll drink me out of my own house.” 
“I’ll pay double.”
“Bullshit you’ll pay double. You’ll pay five silvers if you want to drink here. Last time I had a big man come ‘round, he put me behind by a week. And you’re bigger than he is.”
“I won’t be here long.”
Takes a sip.
“Actually, it might be a while.”
“Come. The lords.”

            <Text>Good and Evil cycle vs. Complexity of reality
(Iram and Elram) vs Mazydie

There are things greater than tribalism and us vs. Them and Empire vs. Rebellion
Jandrians vs. Empire - Ayramun + Mazydei vs. Ayram

The futility of being human vs. The Ubermensch
	- “What you seek you will never find…” vs. Mazydei acceptance of reality
	- Iram/Pyetle/etc. Incapacity to change themselves, vs. Mazydei ability to change very essence.

Iram can’t just kill self to kill Zuramu, because then gets reborn as Zuramu. That’s how they switch selves.
But why not chop self up?  Happens too fast. Matter of minutes. 
But why not machine that is constantly killing.
Iram tried a cult to do that! - worked for two hundred years, but one individual got curious.

Soor vs. Seer
The story’s got two sides.
Soor’s Blade / Seer’s blade
Soor was so over the whole cycle, that he wanted to remove himself from the equation. 

Iram is just a dude

Soor ends up crushed under a rock, but still alive - stuck in a state of delirium from the pain. Drugged God.


Iram tried to influence the religion of a closed tribal society, but it just doesn’t kick. That’s why he began the development of a globalized society - to break down tribal relationships - to create fertile ground for the message. Jesus couldn’t preach to the jews, but the message landed within Rome.

            <Text>Above, the roof was invisible, but I knew that beyond it was rather more than 300 metres of solid rock. As I worried and fretted about how to get down this hole, my friend Kevin offered encouragement. &quot; Can't you get a move on? I'm freezing.&quot;

he principle was similar to putting a rawl plug into plaster. The execution was more difficult.

 as the blackness unfolded between my feet I felt the intoxicating lurch of high- grade adrenalin.

There were boulders, big ones, coming into view. Twenty-five metres down I touched bottom. Reassuringly confined at the top, the shaft had belled out: I was standing in a large cavern, curved strata stretching beyond vision in stacks against the walls. A little waterfall flowed into a pool and began a streamlet, flowing away into the high corridor beyond. I filled my lungs and shouted, testing the echo: &quot;Kev! Rope free! It's enormous...&quot;

We leaned over the edge, looking into a small chamber with a slot at the far end. Kev picked up a rock. &quot;Just listen to this,&quot; he said. He tossed the rock through the slot. I expected to hear it land. but there was silence. After a long age of seconds a stupefying, far-off boom rumbled below. We climbed down into the chamber and threw more rocks, hiding our terror with hysterical laughter.

Six seconds before they hit the bottom, Kev. That makes it 180 metres deep. The height of the Post Office Tower. God's Holy Trousers!

Earlier in the century there had been an iron mine at Los Lagos, and the British mining engineer constructed the track to supply it. He had also constructed the mine, and when it collapsed, killing some local miners, the survivors of the accident lynched him.

in low-lying hills around Los Lagos and other areas along the northern coast, where subterranean streams had cut out mainly horizontal cave systems. The early expeditions didn't have the technical capability to cope with caves of a more vertical nature, with many large underground drops; overhanging, smooth and wet. The largest drop they could manage was about 120 metres, roughly the size of Gaping Gill Main Shaft in Yorkshire.

John was large and square, and seemingly impervious to pain or discomfort. He looked rather like the product of spare part surgery, and perhaps what had happened was that they had left out the pain centre. Graham, by contrast, was small, shy and exceptionally strong. He was very good at getting through the tighter sections in caves, and he did this by intelligent wrigglings, whereas John made his way by battering his body against the rock until it gave way. In the contest between John's flesh and the age-old hardened limestone, John invariably won

A thin winter fog muffled the distant lamps of the town. 

Simon fowler was trudging up the road next to me and seemed to feel a vague responsibility for hte setback. 

Virgin passage. It’s incredible. 

y back to bed through snow that sparkled with starlight.

There were sounds of clanking enamel mugs and plates outside. We were being urged to get up.

beyond which gentle slopes planted with conifers gave way to screes, crags and snowfields, dominated by the towering bulk of two huge peaks.

I had never been to the Alps: these were the biggest mountains I had seen. Simon observed my wonder. &quot;Pretty impressive, eh?&quot; He pointed, tracing a high line over ridges towards the far horizon. &quot;Ario is up there.&quot; His finger moved round, and came to rest in the direction of a vertical cliff on the opposite side of the Lagos meadow. &quot;The path begins right there.&quot;

a viciously steep and sweaty climb on muddy scree, with only a short respite before the shorter Sod Three. Still the ground rose, the path following a long dry valley. On its other side bleached bare limestone soared to 2,000-metre peaks, and everywhere dark holes and depressions bespoke the existence of caves.

Again, I had been unprepared for the magnificence of the surroundings. Straight ahead, across the Cares Gorge, the towers of the central massif stood in a serrated row like the teeth of a giant animal. On our side, the nearby peak of Jultayo began the main ridge of the Macizo de Cornion, a jagged, diagonal spine. Looking back that first morning, cloud had come from the sea, filling the lower valleys, leaving the massif floating free in the sunlit air. Fifty metres away Xitu's entrance opened in a fold in the ground. We threw a rock in and a sound of startled cawing echoed from below: a mother crow flapped her wings and emerged briefly from the shaft. It seemed unlikely that the birds would be able to put up with the intrusion from cavers for long.

The way led over boulders and a greasy slope, beneath cracked and dry stalactites into a comfortable room: Customs Hall. It had been well named: the anteroom to Xitu's further secrets. Cutting a swathe through its floor was a black, vertical fissure. We held our breath and ceased movement: faintly, from far below, the fissure emitted the sound of a tumbling stream.

a simple chimney climbed by pushing against the opposite walls with back and feet.

 Soon the hole between our feet was frighteningly deep. The floor was out of sight and rocks we knocked from our footholds took uneasy seconds to clatter to a halt. We reached an awkward move, between a boulder jammed in the passage and a fragile-looking platform. Stuck to the walls were banks of cemented pebbles, legacy of the time when they had formed the bed of a stream which had long ceased to flow. &quot;Is this the bold step, Mike?&quot; I asked. Mike didn't know, but thought not. We continued.

&quot;No, this isn't it. We're not there yet.&quot; To my horror and amazement he started traversing round the hole on the cemented pebbles, which I had already found to be untrustworthy and friable. &quot;For fuck's sake be careful...&quot; He made it to the other side and seemed to be standing on solid rock. I looked around and discovered an easier way to cross the hole, climbing on good limestone.

 The fissure had gone: a short flat passage led to a wall of boulders. There was an obvious route through, reached by climbing high and squeezing through a narrow gap between the rocks. On the far side we climbed down again, into a much bigger, winding gallery, with more of the pebbles on both walls and floor.

the pebbles in the floor merely another unstable cemented bank which might give way at any moment.

Finally the truth sank in. Beyond the slope, the tunnel descended gently again, larger now, with a floor of indisputable solid rock, broken by shining crystal pools. &quot;Mike, you are a twit. You can't possibly have got this far.&quot;
&quot;No, I suppose you're right.&quot; Seizing on his mistake, I demanded the right to name the new cave. My heart beat faster as I always thought it should when exploring galleries never seen before: I felt irritated and angry that Mike's poor memory had denied me this pleasure during the preceding section. I had promised my friend Tess to name something after her: to Mike's weak protests I declared the Teresa Series officially open. Had I foreseen the ribaldry which would later accrue from the rest of the expedition and from other cavers for years to come I would have chosen an alternative. But the name stuck.
There was still more: another sandy crawl, some fine, rocky tubes and wide, high rifts. More than half a kilometre from what we now knew to be the bold step, we came to a stop. So far, the passage had been rising and falling but keeping to the same mean level. It was clearly an example of a phreatic cave, that is one formed without airspace under hydraulic pressure, which meant water could cut a path upwards as easily as down.

 Holes in the floor afforded a glimpse of deeper galleries below, where pools glistened, reflecting our lights. Another climb, and then a junction: one way led to an aven, the other appeared to be the way on.

eat another piece of dried out Spanish bread and mysterious green jam.

Black walls plunged uniformly below the surface of the water, thick mud everywhere suggesting that the water backed up a long way in times of high water. 

But the rock was as vertical below the surface ass above: a proper flooded shaft. 

Trevor Neathaway urinated over its edge and christened it Servicio, the Spanish for lavatory.

 realising too late his terrible mistake: the wet wetsuit had effected a coitus interruptus

The Gap. The hole in the floor of the chamber dropped into the middle of a cavern of breathtaking dimensions

 The rope touched the sides in a series of abrasion points all the way down, but at least it was securely anchored. The size of the chamber filled us with awe.

Here, huge rocks were balanced on impacted mud. 

There was a scrunching sound, a strangled yelp, and John was tipping backwards, head first. He bounced once at the bottom of the climb and slid on, down to the bottom of the boulder pile: in all, a fall of more than seven metres. His light was out. Leaning out from the lip of the climb, I saw him staggering blindly, trying to find somewhere to sit down. There was blood on his face.

Addicted to the silence of the falling rocks, we select another each and traverse out along the rift to see if we can get an even longer fall. Dave throws his out but the interval is still no more than five and a half seconds. He points to the slot below us, where we sit braced across with our backs and feet.

Unlike British limestone, the rock in the Picos contains large quantities of razor-sharp authigenic quartz needles, and the sand through which one often had to crawl in Xitu would have made a good grinding paste. We all wore rubber gloves to protect our hands, but many of us were developing painful septic sores on the fingers caused by the needles working their way under the skin - the 'Ario Festers'.

At the entrance, I couldn't believe it: daylight yet again. Another 21 hour trip.&quot;

Needs to pause to eat.

Here we are, more than 600 metres down, 10 hours from the surface, drying tracing paper over a carbide light so we can measure a few more metres of passage. It's so stupid I begin to feel really good for the first time on this trip.

Dave said, if we went at it, to rig the entire cave and push on into new passage. Skunk didn't say much about this, which was a sign he agreed. Dave insisted that we should rig the whole of the entrance series next day. Everyone was sceptical: it meant carrying an awful lot of stuff up the hill and there surely wasn't time. 

I was terribly, terribly unfit. In Oxford I had rather foolishly bought an extra-specially large rucksack, into which I should be able to fit everything I needed to go caving. I was paying heavily for this mistake, because my extra-specially large rucksack was now crammed full of an extra-specially large load of ladders and ropes. I was carrying very much more than any other member of the expedition would, and comforted myself with this thought as I plodded along slowly behind Dave, whose rucksack obviously weighed next to nothing.

What...what's happened, Dave?&quot; I asked, expecting the worst.
&quot;I've lost my bloody contact lens, dammit!&quot;
&quot;Thank God it's only that; I thought it was something terrible.&quot;
&quot;It is terrible! I shall be wearing glasses in all the photos from now on.&quot;


Some people had epics in that rift, with vast amounts of sweat and energy used to go only a few yards. Later on in the expedition Chris Danilewicz, a geology student who had just joined the army, got stuck for more than an hour. He slipped down in the central part and was thoroughly jammed, trying time and again to free himself whilst his four companions waited patiently on the far side for him to get out. The rift was far too narrow and difficult for them to have helped him, and eventually, cold and impatient, they realised this. As the stuck man wasn't in any real danger they might as well get out and begin making supper. Furthermore, his jammed body was just the thing they needed to make their own trip through simple - they could walk over the top of him! It is said to this day that he has them down on his personal hit list.
^^^^^^^^Pyetle gets stuck and only he can get him out.

 have never been so close to being killed before or since. With the main drop directly below me, I had lowered myself over the edge, intending to reach a ledge 2 metres down of the right with my feet. I was clasping with both hands to the firm edge of what I thought was simple a ridge of rock in the floor of the passage above. I was fully committed when I realised that the ridge was a boulder pinned only with dry, dusty mud. It was moving. As it slid, so I began to slide into the hole beneath.Richard saved me with a hand under one armpit. I grabbed his arm and my legs dangled. The boulder moved down my body and fell free, reaching the bottom with a booming retort. I scrabbled for land.

Still Skunk and Keith sat chatting in the refugio, smoking endless Winstons and chewing bread and tinned pate. Keith spent a long time trimming the ends of yet more cigarettes so that they fitted in his waterproof case. To fond and envious farewells, they left at last at two.

To rig the last drop into what appeared to be a chamber containing a deep pool, we stood on a calcite bridge across the shaft. John and Richard bolted furiously while I played a wailing blues harmonica, spurring them to complete the work more quickly than might otherwise have been the case. I was just getting into the theme from the Old Grey Whistle Test, when John handed me a rope.
&quot;For fuck's sake get on down. We can't take any more.&quot;

Keith ended his entry in the log with a recommended list of tackle for 37-hour pushing trips: Four times normal cigarette supply; ammo can of either valium or librium; cyanide capsule (only to be used in extremis); spare limbs to replace those belted against rock walls; spare boots, light, undersuit, oversuit, SRT gear, knackers; replacement crutch, to be used when the first one is chafed by furry suit and harness out of existence; replacement brain, to be used when first one is worn out of existence by lack of sleep.

&quot;Take this, Richard.&quot; As he spoke a hissing came from deep within the bag, and the air in the rift began to smell more and more of butane. Graham. Ever cost-conscious, he had given us a half-used butane stove to take 800 metres down a pothole, and had merely switched the thing off with an easily dislodged tap. I felt for my carbide flame and singed my hand as I put it out. &quot;John,&quot; I said, &quot;you and I are stuck in a squeeze with a bomb. I prevail on you to put your flame out with all possible despatch.&quot; By the time we emerged from the rift, we had headaches from the camping stove, which had finally run out. Fortunately we had spare cylinders.


One wall was clean overhanging rock, the other a series of boulders stacked on top of each other like cinema seats for as far as the eye could see. We began to unpack while Skippy organised a cup of tea.

He made Richard retrieve it by moving a good part of the floor before we were allowed to sit in a circle round the pot and eat, each of us watching eagle-eyed to make sure that no one got more than his fair share.

 I had not bothered to take a caving lamp with me and on its own a single candle cast an unreliable and shadowy light. When I returned the others were levering themselves into their hammocks. I was the biggest, followed by John. He was having great difficulty, and I watched him for hints. It looked impossible uncomfortable to me, but once in John insisted that he had never been more cosy.

Immediately below the pitch, the passage formed a glorious, clean-washed corridor in green, marbled rock. Negotiating the deep lake, we reached the next section of rift, and the upward squeezes leading to the next pitch.

But a day before the camp was due to leave, Keith could hardly walk. Since his thirty-five-hour epic, his knee had stayed swollen, red and filled with fluid. It was so painful that he had not even been able to walk to Los Lagos to carry food or visit the bar, and he had spent the week since his accident miserably immobilised at the refugio. &quot;I might as well go home,&quot; he said. &quot;It's much worse being here and not being able to go caving.&quot;
The situation called for desperate remedies, and one was proposed by Eduardo. He knew an old mountain shepherds' trick for reducing inflammation, he said. It would be painful, but had been known to work.
Eduardo disappeared into the kitchen. The smell of vinegar wafted out. He returned with a poultice, made, he said, of boiling vinegar and salt. Gritting his teeth Keith extended his leg and Eduardo slapped the poultice onto his livid knee.
&quot;Aaaargh...arrrr...errrg...arrr.&quot; There was no doubting the pain Keith was in. His face had gone grey, and his eyes seemed sightless as he tried to keep the poultice on. Finally he could take no more and flung it away, still gasping.
Our medical officer, Richard, had assumed that the swelling and inflammation were caused simply by the impact of Keith's knee against the wall of the cave. But that afternoon, to his and Keith's amazement, the knee began to point. A dot of white appeared among the redness. It had been an abscess all along. Richard remembered one of the cardinal rules of his trade: &quot;The good surgeon never lets the sun set on undrained pus.&quot; By teatime, Keith's knee was ripe for puncture, and a pint of poison spilled out. It began to return to its normal size and colour. By evening, Keith was walking with only a slight limp. Next day even that was gone. He dressed the knee and ran up the hill behind the refugio. The treatment had worked. He joined the camping party. As the group of five made their way to the cave a mist rolled in from the gorge, obscuring them and everything. When I saw them again, I thought, Xitu would be one of the deepest caves in the world.

I chewed mine, which precluded any conversation, so tried instead to imagine what a kilometre of rock looked like...half a mile's worth of limestone that had been scrunched into place by the titanic forces that were moving Africa northwards, and being slowly eroded by this stream. The down- climbing had made my wrist injury start to bother me again, and I noticed Skunk was rubbing his damaged elbow.

I couldn't believe how difficult it was, more than 1,000 metres down. We had expected a huge master cave, but instead were required to slide and stretch between jammed blocks which threatened to tumble and crush the insignificants who had disturbed the peace of the centuries.

 It was much bigger than we had imagined: 30 metres or more to the other side, where the walls plunged sheer into the water. It was clear with a perfect, turquoise transparency, and we could see that the lake was very deep indeed.
We had been three nights underground, although we had spent only two periods asleep. The sunshine was blinding, and we squinted as we lay exhausted on the grass. The colours of the sky and hills were as vivid as if we had been given sight for the first time.

our checking things while we stood shivering, passing helpful comments like &quot;for Christ's sake hurry up!&quot; and &quot;I don't think this rope's going to be long enough.&quot;
At last he clipped his rack on the rope, but this was only a prelude to another 15 minutes of alterations and adjustments. By now we were blue with cold, and after threatening to castrate Keith and throw him down if he didn't get on with it, he was finally ready.
Without his death, we might never have gone back to the Picos. His own presence on the next expedition had been doubtful: after Xitu, he said, he didn't think deep vertical caves could ever have the same allure, and he had, he said, 'found the way on' - with air tanks on his belt. his losing that way stopped the rest of the team's accelerating drift apart. At his funeral in Wedmore, not five miles from where he died, we were together again, and after the Catholic priest had intoned what seemed to me a maddening ritual untruth about how lucky Keith was to get to heaven early, we sat with his parents, drinking whisky in celebration at our own survival and toasting the man that he had been. A few weeks later we had a dinner in Oxford. Graham would lead another trip. El Joon '82, a small reconnaissance, was on.

Alvaro had been a keen and expert climber until a serious fall left him wrecked. He was a short, powerful man with curly hair and long arms. Bulging muscles tugged at his T-shirt, which covered a scarred body. His left leg bent sideways at the knee, the bones knitted badly after his accident, so that as he walked he would lope along at great speed. His broken English was almost a parody of an accent, and lurching by my side he told me what had happened to him. His pidgin gave the story a simple horror.

Close up, the entrance was a terrifying, jagged rent in the earth. Fifty metres away, among the grassy boulder slopes and clumps of startling alpine flowers this gateway to hell was invisible. Large square-winged Egyptian vultures circled the cliffs in the rising thermals, and also small thrushlike birds known locally as Perdices. Sometimes the silence was broken by a falling rock, and there would be a flurry of movement high on a cliff face - shy rebeccos, the chamois of the Picos. These small deer, though the timidest of creatures, would gaze at the cavers from a vantage point on the skyline, baffled no doubt as we grunted and sweated along with our heavy packs. They were incredibly agile, racing along the crags with enviable ease. Only once did I see one slip. As George and I rested on a small col, a pair of the delicate animals raced away from us up an apparently sheer face. Above them, the rock looked a severe proposition for a roped human, but as they stood abruptly motionless on a ledge there were perhaps seven hundred feet of precipice beneath their hooves.

Over the centuries, the entrance to C4 had acted as a giant funnel for frost-shattered rock, which had tumbled down to make a great pile of underground scree. The ladder lay against the scree and for most of the way down seemed to be the only solid barrier preventing the whole lot from caving in on top of me. Only a few rungs down I could see that the way on at the bottom was hopeless, filled with razor-sharp boulders on every side. Yet just below the pitch head, set in one wall, was a square window into a much larger shaft. Stones fell down a long way before hitting anything.

 His broken English was almost a parody of an accent, and lurching by my side he told me what had happened to him. His pidgin gave the story a simple horror.
I have very luck. In Macizo Central I make climb - very difficult. Is winter. After finish climb, I descend and felled three hundred metres. I lie in snow for four hours before found, but all the time I..

&quot;I bring it. We have when finish cave.&quot;
&quot;Ah!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Now is time for it! I have it in my bag.&quot;
With this he reached down into his bag and produced ham, sausage and a tube of gooey evaporated milk which he squirted into our mouths in turn. &quot;Is good it, eh?&quot;

I knew from Keith's description that the way on was very obscure. We found it, almost buried under stones, below one wall: a low, flat-out crawl, leading to a bizarre little tube, barely big enough to enter, corkscrewing down. It was time to take a deep breath: impossible to see what lay below beyond my body filling the descending passage. I had to let myself go, trusting to Keith's account in the 1981 log that the tube did not suddenly open out into a large shaft. Soon I was reassured. It slowly enlarged and gave way to an easy climb down the wall of a big, dry and exceedingly pleasant corridor. &quot;George!&quot; I yelled, &quot;this place is absolutely brilliant...&quot;

The first 10 metres or so weren't extreme: the next five times that length were. The sludge, cold, grit-laden, viscous, was many inches deep. At different levels in the fissure were broad flakes, forcing one to press deeply into the filthy trench beneath them. Everything caught. The last part was the worst, contorting, unremittingly strenuous, appalling with the infuriating yellow tackle bags. Again it emerged onto a pitch, but a traverse led to a small ledge from which to belay. Even the roof was covered with mud here. We were still keen but it seemed wise to leave it for that day.

we had drunk the lot. The lone Spanish walker staying at Ario had a hard time of it, as one by one the victims of the free market economy lurched across to the door, the born again fabada falling out to the eagerly awaiting goats. William was especially bad. Later, with everyone tucked up in the dormitory upstairs, his terrified yelp suddenly rent the night air:

&quot;Help, help! Am I being sick out of the window or over the edge of my bed?&quot;

Calcite - the stuff form which stalactites and stalagmites are made - is very weak rock.


 Dave had tried feebly to hammer, and the passage led off, a winding fissure with white, smooth walls. As we crawled in, they reflected our carbide flames, filling the passage with bright light.
The passage was of a type with French cavers call a meander, a narrow corridor winding both in plan and cross section. Movement in it was strenuous. As in the Xitu rift, we had to support ourselves without a floor in the widest part, and it was so narrow that it was impossible to face ahead. We thrutched sideways, looking over one shoulder, unable to turn our bodies or our heads.
 &quot;It goes! Come on down!&quot; My last words echoed and re-echoed. Not much further - all easy going along the ledge - I was at the lip of a big shaft, booming and honking like a crazy foghorn and listening to the glorious reverberations coming back from below. My conversation with Richard - &quot;get the tackle-ackle- ackle...don't forget the chocolate-olate-olate&quot; - resounded mightily, the first human voice the cave had ever heard.

We sere soon stumbling in a bewildering maze of depressions, rises and descents. Even if we had wanted to, we would have been unable to find the relative haven of Top Camp again, and we clung to the bearing for dear life. Time and again we began steep downslopes: this at last must be the climb down to Lagos, I thought. But pausing for a spot of awkward boulder scrambling at the bottom, the bearing took us inexorably up again. William had ricked his knee and was going very slowly. Increasingly anxious, aware that the others would be well into their meal while darkness was approaching, Richard and I hurried ahead through the veil of rain. From a long way behind, invisible, William made urgent pleas for us to wait. When he caught up, he showed the first signs of exposure.
At one time, the water from the Font had flowed off at quite a shallow angle into a wide passage. With the centuries, it had found a weakness in the rock and cut down in a new, thinner slot - Stead's Braille Blunder and the impassable rift beyond. As in many other cases - perhaps rainfall had once been higher - the old way was big enough for cavers, and the new was not
We had all agreed on putting up a memorial to Keith, but felt a little uneasy, knowing that he himself had been very rude about a similar plaque to a caver in Black Shiver Pot in Yorkshire. The caves are permanent, he had said, but we are transitory. In the end, we decided to put it at the bottom of Xitu's steep entrance climb, where it would be seen by future cavers and those making more than a casual inspection, but not by walkers on their way to the refugio. It was made of stainless steel and read:

            <Text>TODO: Consider cutting on the suicide/pilgrim note, leaving the journey ambiguous. Maybe move it all somewhere else. 
It was nights when he got most emotional.
A companion for those lonely nights where 2am turns to 3am and before you know it, the world moves on and on, as you stare at the ceiling and contemplate everything that went wrong, everything you did and everything you could've done. Just pure melancholy and a gut-wrenching feeling of surrender. 
People that you’ve been before that you don’t want around anymore.





Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. This is a simple matter of fact, for art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see, and Nature’s beauty is 
Inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns. The felsing quars call it infinitely nested beauty, and they say it goes on for as far as it is possible to look. If the mood is right, then shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve. So, there is no point in trying.

Salavan had a son named Mandrameen, and Mandrameen liked art. He wasn't very good, but he liked to paint landscapes, and write flower poems, and make little clay sculptures of women. He was impressed by the things a master could make, and he wanted to be impressive himself. Salavan tried to explain that nothing anyone made was impressive when compared to Sol's creation.
When Mandrameen came of age and continued to show no signs of ‘getting himself together as a man’, Salavan sat Mandri down and told him to go out to the Sand and see the truth of the matter for himself. He said that the Sand has a way of destroying the things that blind a man to his true purpose. 
He said that the desert heat would pull Mandri's mind out from his body, and if he lingered there in the sun, near to death, then all of Mandri’s childish fantasies would evaporate. With his body hollow, Nature’s beauty would pour into him and force him to see the truth about the edge between himself and the Universe. 
Maybe then Mandri would accept the role that the Creator set out for him and all men.
Salavan didn’t think that his son would actually do it, but at the age of eighteen Mandrameen did, he ran away from home. 
Mandri was only a mile out from Shagota when 
“Mandri, Mandri. God-damned, idiot Mandri.”
Only a mile out from shagota and he was already begging to regret his decision. But regret he could deal with, it was the pangs of ___ he could not.

Salavan told his wife it was suicide. He told her not to expect to see Mandri again. But suicide wasn’t the right word for it. It wasn’t the word Mandri used. Suicide carries a sense of purposeless, but Mandri took to the road with a greater sense of purpose than he’d ever had before. He called it a pilgrimage. Most pilgrims die, after all.
The road he took was an old, unused smuggler's road that led west out of Shagota, called the Scuttle Road, and it ran west through the marshlands and then it wound up and over the Hias mountains before wiggling down and into one of the more beautiful parts of Sand. Beautiful according to Salavan himself. It was called the Junei Plain.
Unfortunately for Mandrameen, he was a short, skinny, and too-rich city boy who’d only ever measured out leagues on a map. He didn't know that if you sleep out in the marshlands at that time of year, then you've got to sleep up off the ground or else your flesh becomes a feast for the millions of darkfly grubs that wriggle in the earth. He didnt know that ----. He didn't even know that if you walk for hours and hours, feet sliding around in the sandal, you are liable to get blisters. much less did he know how to prevent a blister from festering.
Worst of all, he didn't know that if you travel anywhere on the Jandri continent then you've got to bring more water than you think you need. Mandri had only brought one large goat skin watersack and just assumed that he’d be able to refill it at wells along the way. But well after well in the marshlands was spoiled by salt and algae. In one remarkable instance, Mandri pulled up a well-bucket, and in it was handful of wet feathers, slimy meat, and bone. 
From that he tried to compose a story about death. About a bird had falling into a well, about how its corpse was busy spoiling the water. 
He figured the well water would look better once he'd gotten out of the marshlands and up into the Hias mountains, but there on the rocky slopes he passed one well without realizing it, and then he couldn’t find the next one, and the one after that was dry.
At that point, Mandri's watersack had been empty for a whole day. He started to get headaches. Not difficult headaches but they were always there and they wouldn't let him sleep. Just as he started to feel the nausea coming on, a miracle occurred - Sol sent clouds down to rest upon the mountaintops. 
These clouds rolled in from nowhere. Perhaps spoken into existence by the Istil wind. They sat so low that Mandri was walking through them long before he reached the Hias peaks. They were so thick that cupfuls of dew collected in every crack and crevice, and Mandri's clothes were so wet from simply being in the mist that he could wring his sleeve and drink from it. 
Mandri took the arrival of this heavenly mist to be a sign, an unquestionable sign, that Sol had blessed his journey. These clouds stayed with him, nourishing him, until he'd gotten through the worst of the mountains and had begun his journey down the other side.

It was a kind of sadness that he only felt at night, at night in a high place, where it was just him and the stars and if he sat and stared at them long enough then the immeasurable distance became a knife that could cut through to his heart. And he let it happen. He indulged it. It is an edge that only cuts if you throw yourself upon it in the most egregious act of self-pity, and that’s what makes it all the worse because you really have to have no self respect to go looking for it. Mandri looked for it because there was all this love in his heart but no one to give it to. 
There were people he could have given it to, but they had passed him up, or he had passed them up - it didn’t matter. He was here now, and all the those chances passed up just for this.
A pang of regret that came on so hard he had to grit his teeth to bear it.
Then his eyes welled up. 
When the sadness started to come in and tear at his chest, he let it. 
Spinning out of control.
When it got to the point where he could hardly breathe, well, he had to breathe, and with the first chestful of air that was the end of it. For all the build up and the pain and the dread, a single breath chased it away. Sometimes it took two. The pain wasn’t all gone; there was always a tightness in his chest that lingered until he woke up the next morning. 

Two days later, coming down the western slopes, and he was again at the bottom of his water-sack. He began again to thirst. Each morning he licked what dew he could from the rock, but it wasn't enough. When he peed his urine almost as  dark as a roasted barley beer, and when little grey lizards heard his tinkling on the rocks they came out, took a sip of it, then spat it right back out and scurried back into the shade.
Then headaches and the nausea returned. One day later and he'd vomited out what little water was left in his body. He'd grown so weak that he was forced to toss his pack and his watersack. It was then that he knew he'd die out in the Sand. He figured that the clouds in the peaks behind him only meant to tide him over until he made it down to the Sand so that he could fulfill his journey's purpose.
To save energy he only moved at night. During the day he'd lounge in a boulder's shadow, and in between bouts of sweatless, fitful sleep he'd take in the beauty of the Sand as it stretched out below the foothills. The sight of it teased him onwards. The Junei Plain was such a vision in the afternoon: a brilliant pastel sea of pink sand dunes, yellow gypsum, and white salt, all swirled together on the landscape like paint on a painter’s palette. He had heard tell of this beauty, he had read poems, seen paintings, but his father was right - it needed to be seen in the flesh. It seemed so impossible. How could the Istil wind not blow it all together and muddy the colors? He was eager for night to come so that he could get moving again.
On Mandrameen's final night the Scuttle Road spat him out at the foot of the mountains. His head was a dizzy mess and there was a dull pain in his mouth, when he put his fingers into it to press down on the pain, he found that his tongue was drying out and shriveling. To make matters worse, there was almost no strength left in his twiggy legs. They had managed a plodding pace for as long as they could. When the road curved down into a shadowy ravine, Mandri misjudged the slope. His legs gave out as soon has he stepped down into it.  
He fell forward, flailing, and he hit the ground hard with his shoulder. Then he slid, rolled, and tumbled down into that road-hewn ravine like a limp sack of potatoes. At length he came to rest at the bottom, sore all over, and completely covered in the ochre dust of clay. 
He was on his stomach, and it took a colossal effort for him to right himself, first to get up to his elbows, and then to crawl up to the bank of the ravine to rest. He did not want to die face down. He did not want to die here. He wanted to die in the Sand.
He tried to stand up again, but his legs wobbled and gave in. Then, with a groan and a sob, Mandri pulled himself up under the husk of a nearby Karkle bush, which was as dried out and nearly dead as he was. It’s thick, sticky branches would offer a little shade from the sun that was coming to end him. 
And then Mandri cried. 
He cried without tears because his body was so starved for moisture. He cried without a sound because his parched throat could hardly bear a whisper. He cried because of the pain, and he cried because he was so close yet so far to that vision of the beautiful Sand. Instead of losing himself in that sacred place he would suffer such a prosaic fate - death in a dark trench, with nothing but rocks, a dead bush, and dead sticks washed into that ravine by ancient rains to keep him company. 
He thought that if he slept then maybe a little strength would return to him. If he were well-rested, he could make one last march down into the Sand. In a few hours, when the morning sun came, he would get up and keep going. So he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
But the morning sun does not come all at once to those foothills. There the mighty Hias peaks cast a long shadow that stretches across the whole of the Junei plain. It takes twelve fingers [fingers is a time-measurement for Jandrians] for the sun to peel the night all the way back to where Mandri slept, and when the sun did finally reach him, it was almost noon. By then he was past the point of no return. He had become a shiska, and His dessicated mind was busy with the triage of his body’s functions. Trivial things like coherent thought made way for his pumping heart, for his labored breathing. He spent an hour like that, lying there in the dappled shadow of the karkle bush, gulping down the dusty, dry air like a fish out of water, not aware enough to even realize that these were his final moments. A whole hour like that, just a sense organ baking in the heat, and then he died.

“You believe that the gap between human and ant is so great, so clear and obvious that it should serve as the root of an analogy. Why? Are humans a more successful creature than the ant? By what standard? At the fundamental level of information, the only *real* difference is the time scales at which the human brain can function when compared to the ant colony. Indeed this is the only *real* difference between myself and you. This leads to different behavior. Different, but better? There is no justification for saying one is worse than the other, because to do so you must assume that there is an objective frame of reference. What reason do you have for privileging the human’s experiences over the ant’s? Because you are a human?”

“So you are saying we are all equal?”

Bravery is a measure of uncertainty. When we train soldiers, we train the bravery out of them. We dont want brave soldiers. We want cool-heads. We want men who know what they’re doing, and when you know what you’re doing, there’s not much room there for bravery.
For example, if you knew the time of your death, there would be no question of bravery.

Morality, depending on your perspective, can be objective or subjective.

Noone is arguing that hierarchies don't exist - marxists dont deny that, feminists dont deny that, biology professors dont deny that. The former two in fact base their theory on the existence of hierarchies and inequality - what they both have in common is the criticism of the current hierarchy in western societies, and it's telling that Peterson considers the status quo, which the &quot;postmodern neo-marxists&quot; do consider a construct of &quot;western patriarchy&quot; as the same as the hierarchy, which to Peterson is the default state of nature, and therefore the natural.
If you consider the status quo discriminatory, sexist, economically predatory or flawed in any way, then there you have it - Peterson abusing the poor lobsters to justify exploitation. Quod erat demonstrandum.

&quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness&quot; is an influential essay by American feminist Jo Freeman that concerns power relations within radical feminist collectives. The essay, inspired by Freeman's experiences in a 1960s women's liberation group, reflected on the feminist movement's experiments in resisting leadership hierarchy and structured division of labor. This lack of structure, Freeman writes, disguised an informal, unacknowledged, and unaccountable leadership and ensured its malefaction by denying its existence. As a solution, Freeman suggests formalizing the existing hierarchies in the group and subjecting them to democratic control.

Remember history or be doomed to repeat its mistakes. 
I don’t know about that. In Zosa there’s a blood feud a thousand years running. Two tribes. They remember the history. Think about it every night before they go to bed. Instead of counting sheep they count the wrongs done to them. Sometimes I think, what if I could snap my fingers and they’d wake up and forget all about it - all that history, just gone. You can’t tell me their lives wouldn’t be better. You say remember history or be doomed to repeat its mistakes, I say, forget history or be doomed to its chains. Remember the broad strokes, sure, but mostly, I think we need to forget.


“easier to say ‘Everything is bullshit’, than to look into the complexity of systems as they exist and configure yourself within it.

‘Negotiate our way around the ribs’

Please continue to maintain friendly relations with the Russians, because whether we want to or not, whether we like or abhor them, we have to live with them across a border, and this is by no means easy or simple... Just be careful, I know them well and longer than any of you.
Remember that the soul of a Russian, if not of everyone of them then of almost everyone, is permeated with the spirit of hatred for every free Pole and for the idea of a free Poland.
They are easy and capable of feeling even great friendship and will love you sincerely and warmly, like a brother, until they feel that in your heart you are a free man and you are afraid of their love, in which the dominant element is the lust for protection over you, in other words: power.

If one's own freedom is unattainable, the freedom of others arouses envy and disgust. For centuries we have been too painful an example for them, a denial of their own fate. I fear that it will be a long time before they understand that no one and nothing, except death, can take away our right to freedom...



Fiona hill on putin:
Don’t get caught up in responding and reacting to what the russians are doing.
Every time we pause, he makes a move. That’s what he’s known for. It’s his trademark. He’s a master of pre-emption. He has lots of contingencies. He tries to lay out as many options as possible. He’s not going to stay still while we move on into a whole host of negotiations, he’s going to keep on moving. He ups the ante. 

Need to reframe the issue, not be on the back feet. Get ahead of it. Not constantly reacting to his various moves.

Ukraine. The sadness of having to fight when you don’t want to. You are driven to it. Man saying goodbye to daughter to go die to kill an invader. The absurdity of war. They have no idea. She is crying. You are crying. You know you could run a way, but you couldn’t live with yourself if you did.  So, you’ve got to pick up arms and go do a senseless thing, kill another person, for the simple reason they want to kill you, and people like you. It’s unfair. That’s the root of it. Just how unfair it is. 

Smoke in the distane. Wht this means (come and see)

All that bullshit. All you’ll get is a lesson learned.

Theodor Adorno, quoting the playwright Christian [Dietrich] Grabbe, once said that only despair can save us. Today, it’s common for Russians who are pained by what’s happening to feel self-recrimination and shame; they try to justify themselves or apologize. These are understandable and kind-hearted feelings, but they can’t lead to action. At the end of the day, this is not a war that the Russian people is waging against Ukraine. Russians will get nothing out of this war, they will lose in the most monstrous possible way, it will be an immense catastrophe for the country — all we’ll get is global hatred, a destroyed economy, a crushed society, and possibly a defeated army. 

Many thinkers defined humans precisely by their capacity for suicide. A person is capable of saying, for whatever reason, “I say ‘no’ to my physical being.” That reason could be a feeling that their continued existence is impossible, or it could be a desire for prestige and fame — historically, things like that have pushed people to suicide. 

Need to stop negotiating against ourselves.

George Corfe - the look of pain. “I consider god alone the one who kills and makes alive. Who wounds and who heals. This explains why a patient might suffer the same form of disease, and be of the same sex and age, with symptoms closely similar, with the same methods of care by the same accomplished physician, nevertheless, one might die, and one live.”
Misleading to generalize the large numbers of sick people. Study each patient on their own terms, by their own face. Study the disease by the index of the countenance. Pay attention to each and every aspect of a person’s face. Gaze into a person’s eyes with their variations, the shadows, the langour, the lethargy, the imploring look for help, the impatience, the terror, the anxiety, the havoc with which the disease is making, and the stamp of which is pictured in the eye, it’s lid, it’s brow. Then we view the brow, this wonderful appendage of expression. This too has it’s silent language. It may be overhaning, raised, or depressed, whilst the lid exhibits its alterations of puffyness, or hollowness, of smoothness or uneveness, of darkness or paleness, of sallow, of brown, of white, of purple. Through a careful study of the patients expression, the physician can learn the disease before he interrogates him as to his sufferings, ailments, or the history of his illness.

The face is always more accurate than a patient’s narrative. First run the eye over the face, and get that by heart, so to speak.

Corfe influenced by Johann Lavater

Ōishi was too obsessed with success, according to Yamamoto. He conceived his convoluted plan to ensure that they would succeed at killing Kira, which is not a proper concern in a samurai: the important thing was not the death of Kira, but for the former samurai of Asano to show outstanding courage and determination in an all-out attack against the Kira house, thus winning everlasting honor for their dead master. Even if they had failed to kill Kira, even if they had all perished, it would not have mattered, as victory and defeat have no importance. By waiting a year, they improved their chances of success but risked dishonoring the name of their clan, the worst sin a samurai can commit

Then the power of the Autocrat, absolute as it is and vigorously as it is exercised, is utterly insufficient to meet the evil. What can a despot do who has no instruments that can be trusted? There is no middle class who pay the taxes and insist upon knowing how they are expended. There is no free Press, with its penetrating and omniscient vigilance, to compel honesty and drag offenders to light and retribution. There is only one eye over all: and that eye can of course see only a small corner of this vast Empire. What the Emperor looks at, or can visit, is well done: everything else is neglected or abused. It is the common and inevitable story wherever you have centralisation and barbarism combined.

March 1666, Vologda region: 17 people self-immolated. 1672, Nizhny Novgorod – 2,000 people. 1675, Vologda region – another 2,000. In 1678, the Paleostrov self-immolation, one of the largest, took over 2,700 people at the sight of soldiers and officials who were sent to stop the burnings. In total in Russian history, there were over 100 officially registered self-immolations of the Old Believers. 

The self-immolation was thoroughly prepared – under the supervision of one of the Old Believer tutors (they didn’t have priests), a “burn house” was built – a vast wooden structure that would contain the self-immolators. For example, a ‘burn house’ built in the Arkhangelsk region for the 1685 self-immolation contained 230 bodies. It wasn’t usually a single-room house, more like several wooden cabins joined together, often in two or more storeys. Typical ‘burn houses’ were meant for several dozen people.
The house was then filled with hay, candle tow, and other flammable materials, including often a barrel or two of gunpowder. The windows and the door were ready to be sealed from the outside by other Old Believers who were to aide the self-immolators. As soon as the Old Believers learned about any military formation heading their way, they locked themselves inside the building and waited for the soldiers to come, then self-immolated

Before self-immolation, all Old Believers and their children were symbolically christened again, because they were to face ‘baptism with fire’. Many of them took monastic vows. But not all of them were so brave to withstand the fire. Inside the ‘burn house’, certain trusted people (that were to burn with the others, too) were armed with rifles and axes to murder those who tried to escape – one should accept the ‘fire baptism’ with humility, because it was a door to eternal life in the Kingdom of God, the Old Believers preached. Anyway, death for those poor Old Believers came pretty soon, not from burns, but carbon monoxide poisoning.

After this crushing defeat, the captured Russian princes were dumped in a shallow ditch and then covered with wooden floors on which the winners organized a feast. The victims died of suffocation with all their bones broken.  

Peresvet is believed to have hailed from the Bryansk area and to have taken the monastic habit at the Rostov Monastery of Saints Boris and Gleb. He moved to the Monastery of Pereslavl-Zalessky, in the service of Dmitry Donskoy. He later moved to the Trinity Lavra where he became a follower of Sergius of Radonezh. Alexander and his friend Rodion Oslyabya joined the Russian troops set out to fight the Tatars under the leadership of Mamai.
The battle of Kulikovo was opened by single combat between the two champions. The Russian champion was Alexander Peresvet. The champion of the Golden Horde was Temir-murza. The champions killed each other in the first charge. According to a Russian legend, Peresvet did not fall from the saddle, while Temir-murza did.

Pirlo lifted the lid on the pranks he and his team-mates would pull on Gattuso. He said: “Rino has always been my favourite target.

“And then when he actually got them right, we’d make out that it was still wrong just to wind him up even more!

You could see the red mist coming down and he just wasn't able to hide it. We could tell what was coming and so we'd commandeer all the knives. Gattuso would grab a fork and try to stick it in us. On more than one occasion, he struck his intended target and the fork sank into our skin. We were as soft as tuna; the kind you can cut with a breadstick. Some of us ended up missing games because of one of Rino's fork attacks, even if the official explanation from the club was one of “muscle fatigue”.

Dream of having genital warts
Horrible dream, so I woke up to get away from the dream
Was difficult to wake up. Sometimes you get that sleep paralysis.
I woke up and there were the genital warts. I was so shocked that I came to believe that these warts couldn’t be real, that I was still dreaming. And of course I was. Once you realize you’re in a dream it becomes obvious. Things don’t resolve themselves fast enough. There isn’t enough detail. So I tried to wake up, and again it was hard. But I woke up. My dream was about dreaming about having genital warts.

You think that exchange of power, term limits matter? What will happen is the people at the top will create a degree of separation, a company that feeds the system.

I’ve lived for the greater part of my life as a homosexual that can’t express himself sexually because the Holy Spirit refrains me from doing anything that will only harm my spirit, His grace is sufficient for me.
You don’t know the condemnation that I have experienced living with same sex attraction. Never to be able to have a family. I am sure you have your own fight of faith, we all have something that needs daily attention to keep our flesh down.
Living with condemnation day in and day out, I finally came to an unorthodox approach, I was exhausted and tired of having desires for men. I threw my arms up and gave thanks for homosexuality. It certainly felt odd, but I was giving thanks in all things, as Paul instructed the Thessalonians. Days later, the condemnation lifted. I thanked God for all sins and blessings alike. Giving thanks in all things became liberating. And then I heard the words from the Lord, saying, “be yourself and love Me”.
You may think I am justifying my answer. Not at all. I am convinced of certain things just as you are convinced of certain things.
You see, I found a way out. When I gave thanks for my sin, the condemnation left me. It helped by giving me courage to thank the Lord for everything. I found that a power was working on my behalf and little bit at a time, the desire for men waned, masturbation ebbed and it has become less to almost nothing.
Every once in a while, I will feel lonely and I may think about having a male companion. But it last for a little while and then it goes. Such is a thorn in my flesh.

Pol's aim was to plunge the country into an inferno of revolutionary change where, certainly, old ideas and those who refused to abandon them would perish in the flames, but from which Cambodia itself would emerge, strengthened and purified, as a paragon of communist virtue. 

Short also thought that the Khmer Rouge's ideology stood apart from other forms of Marxism due to its &quot;monastic stress on discipline&quot;, with &quot;the systematic destruction of the individual&quot; being a &quot;hallmark&quot; of its ideology.[420] Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge believed that in order to crush the individualistic attitude that they thought was endemic in Cambodian society, coercion was needed to ensure the creation of a collectivised state.[421] Short noted that an underlying doctrinal view among the Khmer Rouge was that &quot;it is always better to go too far than not far enough&quot;, an approach that was &quot;at the root of many of the abuses&quot; which occurred under their regime.[422] Within the Communist Party itself, hunger, lack of sleep, and long hours of labour were employed at training camps to ramp up the physical and mental pressure and thus facilitate indoctrination.[423] Short commented that &quot;no other communist party&quot; in history ever went &quot;so far in its attempts directly to remould the minds of its members&quot;. 

 Pol Pot's real name is Saloth Sar, and that his father was a landowner distantly related to the royal family. A third version is that Pol Pot is really Tol Sat 

Pol Pot had a thirst for power.[434] He was introspective,[435] self-effacing,[436] and displayed self-control.[436] He was also highly reclusive,[5] obsessed with secrecy,[437] and fearful of the threat of assassination.[438] He was often in control while pretending not to be;[439] Short stated that he &quot;delighted in appearing to be what he was not – a nameless face in the crowd&quot; 

&quot;Such was the darkness of that day, the tortures and lamentations of the afflicted, and the power of former presidents, that we walked in the clouds, and could not see our way.&quot; 

Not included is the different phenomenon ritual murder or any ritual abuse, which is sometimes referred to as witchcraft or witch-hunting (meaning the man-hunt for body-parts for ritual purposes). 

fter confessions, the accused or self-accused children were rewarded with large amounts of meat to induce a purifying vomiting 

In May 2008, Amnesty International reported that up to 1,000 people in the Gambia had been abducted by government-sponsored &quot;witch doctors&quot; on charges of witchcraft, and taken to detention centers where they were forced to a drink poisonous concoction at gunpoint, known as kubejaro.[13] On 21 May 2009, the New York Times reported that the alleged witch-hunting campaign had been sparked by the Gambian President, Yahya Jammeh. The president continued a series of &quot;witch hunts&quot; over the next seven years, in which rural villagers experienced beatings, kidnappings, and forced confessions (after the ingestion of kubejaro, which often made the victims extremely weak or unconscious). Deaths that occurred during the time were due to the side effects of drinking kubejaro, such as kidney failure, or beatings. Later, the Gambian government launched an investigation of these crimes and opened a center to support the victims. However, a Washington Post report found that many of the victims had received no support or outreach from such initiatives. Many of the victims also still suffer from health problems, such as pains, weakness, and anxiety.[14] 

On the second day of Guadalcanal we captured a big Jap bivouac with all kinds of beer and supplies ... But they also found a lot of pictures of Marines that had been cut up and mutilated on Wake Island. The next thing you know there are Marines walking around with Jap ears stuck on their belts with safety pins. They issued an order reminding Marines that mutilation was a court-martial offense ... You get into a nasty frame of mind in combat. You see what's been done to you. You'd find a dead Marine that the Japs had booby-trapped. We found dead Japs that were booby-trapped. And they mutilated the dead. We began to get down to their level 


On February 1, 1943, Life magazine published a photograph taken by Ralph Morse during the Guadalcanal campaign showing a severed Japanese head that U.S. marines had propped up below the gun turret of a tank. Life received letters of protest from people &quot;in disbelief that American soldiers were capable of such brutality toward the enemy.&quot; The editors responded that &quot;war is unpleasant, cruel, and inhuman. And it is more dangerous to forget this than to be shocked by reveminders.&quot; However, the image of the severed head generated less than half the number of protest letters that an image of a mistreated cat in the very same issue received, suggesting that American backlash was not significant 


 Salavan sat Mandri down and told him to go out to the Sand and see the truth of the matter for himself. He said that the Sand has a way of destroying the things that blind a man to his true purpose. 
He said that the desert heat would pull Mandri's mind out from his body, and if he lingered there in the sun, near to death, then all of Mandri’s childish fantasies would evaporate. With his body hollow, Nature’s beauty would pour into him and force him to see the truth about the edge between himself and the Universe. 
Maybe then Mandri would accept the role that the Creator set out for him and all men.
Salavan didn’t think that his son would actually do it, but at the age of eighteen Mandrameen did, he ran away from home.

Disaster economics 
Ok, so here's how this works. An upheaval or technological innovation gives the mercantile (business) class the ability to gain large amounts of wealth and challenge the landowner or gentry class. Using their new wealth they support political ideals that curtail the power of the gentry class and allow them the freedom to continue to accumulate wealth. That is when democracy happens. After a while, the mercantile class gains so much wealth that they look to 'lock in' that wealth by becoming the gentry class themselves. At that point their wealth goes towards political ideals that allow them to do that, such as fascism, totalitarianism, or feudalism. This is the cycle.

Chirs fields - did I do that or did the world do that? The world is everything outside me. In a sense, the answer is always the world did it, and so the question becomes did the world do that in response to something I did to it, or did it just do it, not in response to the consequence of any of my actions.  One gets immediately to this kind of babbling scenario, in which an infant or a robot tries to figure out, by measuring correlations, whether the world’s inputs into it have anything to do with its inputs to the world. Jsut asking that question requires enourmous represntative capacity - represent one’s actions, in time, and one has to have a good memory to represent enough actions to get any kind of statistical support about drawing correlations, and that memory has to be represented as a memory, not just part of current input. So how does this all start? This agency. It starts with babbling.

Phenomenological experience as ripples of the one mind.
Wigner - mathematical modeling the natural world
That sitting in an armchair, using math, could predict equations that would describe quasars and black holes and quantum phenonmena etc. Why? Because our personal minds and nature at large rest upon the same natural Mind. That the inanimate universe is studied and described with math, is just the appearance, the image of transpersonal mental processes Out There, which comport themselves in preferred ways, in archetypal ways, in concordance with mind. 

Sym-pathetic

Deception is the prime directive of mind. At the bottome there is mind being mind, telling itself narratives about what it is.Whithout these narratives, nothing would be real. It is this process of self-deception that creates any sense of objectivity and concreteness and reality. \\

Wolpert on dembski
Nonetheless, there are several points intimately related to Dembski's work that bear emphasizing. First, biologists in particular and scientists in general are horribly confused defenders of their field. When responding to attacks from non-scientists, rather than attempt the rigor that the geometry of induction and similar bodies of statistics provide, they fall back on Popperian incantations, trying to browbeat their opponents into acceding to the homily that if one follows certain magic rituals---the vaunted &quot;scientific method&quot;---then one is rewarded with The Truth. No mathematically precise derivation of these rituals from first principles is provided. The &quot;scientific method&quot; is treated as a first-category topic, opening it up to all kinds of attack. In particular, in defending neo-Darwinism, no admission is allowed that different scientific disciplines simply cannot reach the same level of certainty in their conclusions due to intrinsic differences in the accessibility of the domains they study.

I like to think of it like this. Farming fields are stationary, which makes them easy targets. If you want to control someone who depends on that field for food, you have to deny them access, usually with violence. If someone forages for food, however, it is more difficult to control them because it requires control over a much larger area and over the animals and resources within. It’s easy to control a wheat field, hard to control a forest or river. Someone with access to enough food that they do not need to remain near a stationary field would be more mobile, more flexible, and more difficult to control. Pastoralists would be somewhere in between, more vulnerable than foragers but harder to control than a farmer.
If you scale that up, you could say that the harder it is to target a country’s resources, the harder it is to control that country.

entheogen used in rituals 
Since Amanita contains toxic compounds, direct consumption is ill advised, different methods to prepared Amanita to reduce these effects were known to Siberian peoples. One of these methods to reduce the bad effects is to dry Amanita. Though there are not sources that say this was commonly done on the branches of trees. It would have been common to hang food to dry in houses or place it on the roof of a house and cover it with felt to prevent it form being foraged by animals. (Bonus method to reduce bad effects: A person (often a shaman) would consume Amanita, after which the psychoactive substances are present in their urine. Then a person could drink the urine, the entheogenic effects would be present, but many of the toxic compounds would not be present in the urine.)

Open with a single occupancy bathroom - grey wallpaper, our hero is asleep - looks dead - knock on door. “You still in there Zed?”
Zed wakes up. He has no idea who he is or where he is. Has some idea of what he is doing - pooping on the toilet. 
Leaves toilet, coworker runs in. Enters small 3-man office. He questions other coworker in office - what is going on, who am I, etc. Coworker thinks he’s joking at first. When realizes he’s serious, reaches for a pistol, fires, and missess. Our hero charges, a scuffle ensues, and hero kills coworker. Other coworker comes out of bathroom, in apparent disbelief that hero has killed someone. 
Authorities come in, and buy the story  that dead coworker was suffering from amnesia and needed to be killed - story upheld by clueless pooping coworker.

Hero is dropped off at his ‘home’. A ‘wife’ is there. At this point, he knows not to reveal he has no idea who he is, or who she is. Funny hijinks ensue.

Ends with him looking down at earth, burning up because of him, muttering, realizing he should have just been killed as soon as he was ‘born’. He mutters, ‘oops’. And then ‘Oh well.’

This is my entire town. Empty storefronts everywhere, but when you ask about a lease, it's absurd. The owners are like anemones, waiting for a large chain's algorithm to spit the address out as a build location so they can cash in. The low carrying cost of land means they can camp indefinitely. If the city starts to torment them with nitpicky fines (lighting, safety regs, etc) they just build an automated car wash.... meanwhile it's illegal to start a business in your attached garage. 


I have smoked everyday for 15 years, besides quitting while pregnant and the offtimes I couldn't find a dealer before it was legal for recreational use.
I definitely think I am addicted. No joke about it. But perhaps it's not in itself an addictive substance. It's just that we become too dependant on how we feel when we are high, or how acceptable mediocrity is when we are high.
I know past times when I've quit, I struggle with boredom more than anything else. And the boredom seems just so unavoidable, you have to make it over this weird hurdle of reclaiming the joy you once had in your hobbies and stuff like that. It's not easy.

You said it perfectly, friend. I’m addicted, and I’d be lying to myself if I said otherwise. A lot of it is habit - I like the hand-to-mouth of smoking joints while doing other things. And part of it self-medicating. Weed helps my anxiety in the short term, but definitely hurts my depression in the long term.
Haven’t touched my guitar in years, and my only real hobby lately has been hiking (which I do stoned). My place is a mess and I’m really not on top of things like I used to be (aside from work).
I find it easiest to abstain when I’m busy. The temptation is way stronger when I’m sitting around doing nothing, so I just find ways to keep my mind occupied. (I’m single w/o kids, though, so this is probs more realistic for me than for others)
Have you noticed a change in your sleep quality? When I’m smoking, I wake up everyday feeing like I got hit by a bus. That’s not the case when I’m abstaining for long periods

I like weed.

            <Text>Close your eyes and smell a world filled with the fragrances of night-blooming cactus flowers, sacred datura, and the aromatic oils of crostotebush released into the air after the first summer rains.

Sonoran desert has a great variety of species and habitats, the latter ranging from extremely hot, arid desert to semi-arid tropical forset to frigid subalpine meadows. 

Gobal scale habitt = biome - determined dby the climatic factors of temperature and rainfall.  These are in turn caused by latitude, elevation and wind patterns. Plans, ,being generally immobile, are the most obvious and easily recognizable components of a biological community. Plants are more definitive of their biomes because they must be adapted to that specific environment.


Biomes and most other biological calssifications are largely subjective concepts - an attepmpt to make sense of the unwieldy and nearly incomprehensible diversity of nature. Their boundaries are rarely distinct.

Wherever two biological communities or biomes meet, there is usually a zone of intergradation, which is sometimes very wide. For these reasons, classifications differ among classifiers.
Thornscrub as a separate biome between desert and tropical forest?

Biomes subdivided into biotic community. (Brown and Lowe 1982).

Tundra
Tundra is the most poleward and highest elevation biome and is characterized by extremely cold winters. Dominat plant life forms are ground hugging woody shrubs and perennial herbs. Intesne cold excludes trees. No plant can survive if exposed above the winter snow cover. And succulents - the growing season is too short for annuals. 

Everywhere on earth, temperatures at the same elevations become warmer as one moves toward the equator. But an increase in elevation has the same climatic effect as traviling toward a pole: temperature decreases (and percipitation increases). So climates that support tundra like those in the arctic can be found on the highest mountains all the way to the equator. 

Coniferous forest (taiga)
Cone bearing trees, especially pines, firs, and spruces in the northern hemisphere. Cold only a little less severe than tundra. Tree heights a few feet, near the boundary to over 300 feet in more temperate latitudes…. Found at increasing elevations as one moves southward into mexico, until it is pushed off the tops of the mountains by excessive aridity and warmth. 

Temperate broadleaf forest
Dense stands of broadleaf trees that drop their foliage in winter. Milder temperatures, too cold for plants to grow in winter. Warm and humid summers. More species.—— more spcies, but as you push south the trees dwindle out, people dwindle out, and then you have the hrkans.
Scattered aspen groves and ribbons of riparian trees. 
The foothills and lower mountain slopes on the eastern boundary of the sonoran desert support oak woodlands  mixed with pines at slightly higher elevations. The oaks, however are mostly evergreen species; only ephemerally deciduous in spring except during severe droughts. Oak forest that extends as far north as central arizona, where it is ssqueezed out by the cool-teperate rocky mountain forests above it and the more arid grassland and desert below. 

Difference between woodland and forest is that the tree canopies overlap.

Mountains called sky islands.

Mediterranean woodland and shrubland
Semiarid biome that occurs on the west coast of every continent between 30 and for latitude. Smallest biome unique for mediterannean climate: mild, moist winters and hot, dry summers. Called chaparral in North America. Mature chaparral consists almost solely of woody, evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves. The numerous species form impenetrable thickets from 5 to 8 feet tall.  During the long, dry summers the typically resinous foliage and dry, woody stems become explosively combustible. Wildfires raze large areas to ash-covered earth every few decades.  Species are well adapted to periodic blazes. Following fires the bare ground is briefly colonized by a large number of annual species, but the land is soon reclaimed by the shrubs that sprout from seeds or root crowns.  Trees and succulents are rare life forms in chaparral because they are more vulnerable to destruction by the very hot fires. This is how the plant gets rid of the competition.

Grassland
Semiarid biome characterized by warm, humid summers with moderate rain and cold, dry winters.
Scores of species of grass forma nearly continuous coe over large areas. Otehr well-represented life forms are annuals and geophyes (herbaceious perennials such as bulbs, which die to the ground each year).  Populations of trees, shrubs, and succulents are kept at low levels by periodic fires.
Most grasslands in western states are intermediaries between praries and deserts. Grasses in desert grassland are shorte and less dense compared to plains grassland, and the land supports more shrubs and succulents. 

Desert
Driest biome, vegetation determined solely by the extreme aridity. Temperature and seasonality of rainfall determine the spec. Widely spaced plants with small or absent leaves.

Tropical savanna
Warm, semiarid biome by flat land covered with continuous herbaceous vegetation. Usually dominated by greasses, with some trees and other woody pplants. Extensive in africa, australlia, india, and south america. We consider to be ‘ecotones’. Most of these are wrm-temperaate, not tropical. A small part of the plains of sonora subdivision of hte  sonoran desert.

Thornscrub
Is intermeditte between the desert and tropical forest biomes.

Tropical dry forest
No freezing temps, dry season that lasts three to nine months, during which many plants become deciduous. Flowering epiphytes - plants that grow on other plants or rocks but are not parasitic.
Vines.

Tropical wet forest
No  freezing temps and no dry season.

Riparian communities
Not biomes, though they could be considered isolated ribbons of temperate broadleaf forest they are better viewed as a unique habitat type. Occur within any biome wherever there is perennial water near the surface. The term riparian specifically refers to the zones along the banks of rivers; hower it is also applied to the shoreline communites of slow or nonflowing waters such as marshes and lake. 
The drier the surrounding habitat, the more distinct is the riparian zone. In the desert grassland, a flowing stream supports a consipcuous oasis with forests and wildlife that would not otherwise occur in the area. The available water also augments populations of more arid-adapted species. 
Montane streams support alders and aspens, while lower elevations there are cottonwoods and sycamores.
Some ecologists broaden the conecpt of riparian communities to include dry washes in the deserts.  A wash in the lower colorado river vally, withits woodland of palo verdes, ironwoods, and desert willows, is clearly distinct from teh surrounding creosote flats. 

Although many people visualize deserts as dry desolate wastelands, teh term actually defines a wide spectrum of landscapes and plant and animal densities. Most of the sonoran is more reminiscent of a sparse woodland. 
The common denominator is extreme aridity. Water only available for short periods after rains. Desert definition : compare rainfall with potential water loss through evaporation and transpiration. Potential evapotranspiration. Crudely estimated.

A desert is a biological community in which most of the indigenous plants and animals are adapted to chronic aridity and periodic, extreme droughts, and in which these conditions are necesary to maintainthe ommunity’s structure.

The sun shines almost vertically on the equatorial belt year round, but it shines ont he polar regions at a shollw angle and only during each pole’s summer. There are two consequences. A 1-square meter beam of sunlight shines on about 1 square meter of the earth’s surface at the quator at noon, but it covers more than twice that area near the poles. The sun’s light and heat are thus less concentrated at higher latitudes. In addition, the quator the sunlight travels straight down through the atmosphere, but near the poles it travels through much more aire. Where more light is reflected, absorbed, or scattered and less reaches the ground. This is why the equator is hot and the poles are cold.

Equatorial region both hot and wet - it is a zone of warm, rising air. Absorbs much water vapor from the oceans and land vegetation. As this rises it cools. Eventually it reaches saturation , and vwater vapor conenses into clouds and often falls as rain.
The equatorial air rises, then spreads horizontally at high elevations to the north and south. Eventually the now-cool air sinks and flows along the surface to replace the rising air at the equator, forming a circulation cell. It tends to sink at about 30 north and 30 south latitude. Two zones called the horse latitudes by mariners. Sailing vessels were becalmed in these lattitudes. As the air sinks it becomes warm with compression, and becaus there is no source of evaporating water, it becomes drier with increasing temperature. Not only can sinking air not produce rain, but when it reache the ground it absorbs water from teh soil and vegetation, creating even more arid condition. 
More on pg. 13.

Rainshadow of mountain block prevailing winds. As teh wind rises it cools and drops most of its moster on the windward slope. On the leeward side it descens, warms, and dries. Rain shadow desert on the lee side of the mountain.

Desert organisms have evolved a variety of adpatations to avoid getting too much sun.


The valleys are dominated by low shrubs, primarily creosotebush and white bursage. These are the two most drought-tolerant perenial plants in north america, but in the driest areas of this subdivision even they are restricted to drainageways.  Trees grow only in the larger washes. 

5 seasons. 
Summer monsoon - rainy season - in tohono O’odham tradition, the year begins with the most dramatic weather event of the region - the often abrupt arrival of the summer rains.  Monsoon is derived from an arabic word for ‘season’, was applied to a wind that changes direction seasonally. The north american monsoon wind shift, in our case a typically southerly wind in july, brings tropical moist air that moderates the temperatures from junes extremes and can generate frequent thunderstorms. 
Autumn - warm petmps, low humid; little rain; few species in flower, growing season for winter annuals.
Winter - mostly sunny, mild days, with intermittent storms that bring wind, rain and cool-to-cold teps. 
Spring - mild temps little rain, windy,
Foresummer - high temps, very low humidity, no rain, warm and windy to hot and calm, the only common plants in fower are saguaro, and ironwoo, most are dormant until rain arrives.

Ringed by mountains that keep rain away for much of the year.
Moist air moving east from the pacific ocean is forced to rise over the cascades and sierra nevada, cooling as it rises. Since cool air cannot retain as much water vapor as wamer air can, the excess water precipitates in those california ranges. Moisture blown in from the ocean is effectively drained, and the air that moves down the ranges eastern slopes is so dry it cannot produce any more rain.  Knkown as the rain shadow effect. 

At least two things are necessary for rain, a source of moisture and a delivery system for that moisture.

Succulenets that store gallons of moisture. Saguros grow visibly plump after a wet season. The extensive shallow roots of these lants help them capture much o fthe ephemeral moisture before it evaporates. The intense competition for water is one reason desert plants are so well dispersed over the landscape - the bre ground between them is in fact permeated with roots.

Desert survival requires human adaptation.
Tohono O’odham farmers plant semiannually ( e.g. tepary beans, squash, corn, melons, wheat) to correspond to the two rainy seasons. Their fields are designed to catch water washing across the land after storms, often channeling it to areas that have been prepared for planting. A single summer or winter rain can make or break a harvest. They scatter their desert plots widely among several washes to maximize the chance that scattered thunderstorms will soak at least one field.

The tohono dislike jumping to any conclusions about the weather. Avoid any assumption the rain will fall for sure

Modern farmers of large-sclae commercial crops have so divored themselves from the natural rhythm of the desert that they actually dislike rain. Cotton is gown solely on irrigation water. To increase their yields, some farmers stress their plants slightly by withholding water, and the plants produce more flowers as a result. Any natural rainfall during this period is seen, therefore, as interfering with the growers management plans.

These aren’t matters to ponder indoors!

Mirage as a puddle in the distance. Receding edge matching its speed. A shalllow layer of sizzling air sits just above the survace of the hot pavement. When light from the sky encounters this superheated layer, it’s bent towards our eyes. As if a mirror were laid flat on the road, see an image of the bright sky, upside down cars and cacti. Needs a steep angle.

Air temps can drop so rapidly in the first few centimeters above the soil that long legs can be an advantage for a smal animal. Man y desert lizards stretch out their ligs full length and lift their bodies as high as they can. Ground hugging desert creatures live in a world very different to our experience at the higher altitudes of human existence.

Shimmer/atmospheric boil - bubbles of heat rising in the cool air causing objects to ripple at a distane. Larger versions, high in the air, are called thermals. Hawk wheeling in the sky. Rising air carries scent of decaying flesh.

Dust devil is a special kind of thermal. Hotspot - air spirals inward and upward.

Spread of funga spores that cause the disease coccidiodomycosis, better known as valley fever. Spread by dust devlis. 

Airborne dust is a major factor in the formation of the limy desert soil layers called caliche, as well as clay-rich argillic layers, both of which have the profound effects on desert vegetation.

The desert sky is so bright with uv around midday that an exposed surface receives about as much of it scattered from the sky as directly from the sun. 

Desert skies are such a deep bue because desert air is unnaturally pure, free of floating partics and droplets call aerosols. These fill the sky with white ight, diluting the blue. 

Tiny salt crysts from evaporating ocean spray are exceptionally good at capturing water vaopr and creating water droplets. 

Airborne pollen brightening the skys.

Balanced on the jagged horizon, the sun has turned the orange coor of a desert gobemallow blossom. Clearer skies intensify the coors. Make sunsets redder.

Giant monsoon thundercloud, as teh sun slips farther below the horizon, the uptiting shadow fo the earth swaeed the coud from the bottom up. Just above the rising shadow the coud is bathed in teh warm light of the setting sun, but for many miiutes the top of the coud remains bright white, because at that great altitude the air is too thin to appreciably dim and redden the sunlight. The then summit turns pink as its lie by sunight that has  passed close to the surface.

Large couds of dusta nd forest fire smoke rising above the crest of the santa catalina mountains and first thought it was an erupting volcano. Apparently , the fires were  ignited by falling boulders crashign together and cause sparks on the dry hillsides.  Geysers of water shot up from the floodplain, while other streams and springs throught hte region dried up or initiated flow. 

Prominent basalt fields, all formed in last 4 million years. 

Rare heavy rains produce torrents of mud, rocks and  vegetation that cascade rapidy down steep, narrow canyons in the mountains. Spread out from the mountains in gently sloping cones called alluvial fans. Vigorous mudflows can move boulders the size of small ships. 

Pediment - buried shoulder of bedrock that extends from the edge of the mountain some miles towards the valley center, where it meets a buried fault. 

Soil was deep, dark loamy stuff that supported the bountiful agricuture of the corn belt.

Desert soils are unusual. They vary tremendously in texture; many are sandy and gravelly, while others contain layrs of sticky clay, or even rock-hard, white limy layers. … in themore arid parts, surfaces of some soils are covered by a ayer of small stones that can be as tighty interlocked as a roman mosaic, and are coated with dark, shiny rock varnish. 

Gravelly or stony aluvial fans that spil out of mountain drainages into adjacent basins cover much of the face of the sonoran desert.  The sediments that get transported are finer - snads, silts, clays. 

Many sois of the piedmonts and basin floors start out as deposits of gravelly or stony lluvium tht have fairly uniform chracteristics throughout. With the passage of time, however, pronounced horizontal layers called soil horizons develop. You can often aisliy see these horizons in oder, well-developed sois because they differ from one nother in color. 

20-40 inches below the suface is the calcic horizons, white, accumulation of calcium carbonate, which in many areas is thick (3ft) and strongly cemented. Called caliche.

You can tell how much rain a region gets based on how far down the calcium carbonate layer is. Rain pushes it down. In extemely arid regions, may accumulate within a few centimeters of the surface.

Atmospheric additions of calcium contained indust and precippitation are the predominant source of the calcium contained in calcic horizons of most desert soils.  23g of dust per square meter of surface area per year. One half gram of cacium carbonate per square meter of ground surface in one years time.

Precipitation also contains dissolved calcium.

Weathering and accumulation of iron bearing minerals produce red — soil horizons. Biotite and hornblende are common iron-bearing mineras in parent materials derived from many kinds of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Weathering of these mineras creates new minerals, including rust-colored iron oxide compounds. As these compounds accumulate, they paint the soil with increasingly strong reddish hues. Very young soils lack accumulations of these iron oxides and are typicay pale brown or yellowish-brown. 

The degree of reddening depends prinariy on the iron content of minerals in the parent material. 

Desert pavement - stony jumbleof bars and swales is the topographic imprint of the surface’s creation by the powerful tumult of moving water laden with rocky debris. Over time, though, this imprint disappears as teh vertical relief of  these coars, rocky depostis is leveled out, eventally forming the flat pavement of small stones. - differential heating of rock sufaces as the sun passes from eastern to western horizons during the course of the day. Cause s internal strain, eventualy producing near-vertical cracks that tend to be oreineeted alon gnorth to south axes. The best developed pavements are those that have formed over the passage of several tens of thousands to a few hundreds of thousands of years.

See more pg. 92 for how they form

Desert pavements are frequently very dark colored and shiny; in many cases nearly black. Rock varnish, also called desertvarnish. Provides this dark color. Very thin, at most few hundredths of a millimeter. These thin, lustrous coatings contain a variety of constuaents. Cay minerals about 70 perent. 
Process is still debated.  Not a weathering product of the underlying rock. Rock varnish is materials added to and coating the originalr ock surface. 
Not everywhere because rock usually erodes faster than varnish can form. 

By removing the dark varnished stones and exposing the underying ight colored soil, prehistoric peoples created fantastic images of human figures, animals and abstract forms. 

Microphytic soil crusts - algae, lichens, liverwort, and bacteria cover the surface in dense mats. 

‘The personality of the jaguar pervades the wilderness’ - idea of everything reacting to the presence of this predator.

The longer the hohokam lived in an area, the more they hunted out the big game and relied on rabbits and rodents for animal protein. And as they cleared desert vegetation for firewood and fields, they also harvested more jackrabbits, which fled predation by running across flats, instincts telling them to dash for cover that was no longer there. 

Swim bladders of fish is a delicacy.

The place is a desert oasis known as quitobaquito, centered on a spring fed wetland at the base of some cactus stippled hills that lie smack dab on the us-mexico border. … more than 270 plant species, over 100 bird species, and innumerable insects find quitobaquito a moist harbor on the edge of a sea of sand and cinder. Not far to the west of this oasis are volcanic ridges that have frequently suffered consecutive years with only 1 to 2 inches of annual rianfall.



You could easily recognize a desert even if you were blindfolded. You would discover that you could walk fairly long distances without bumping into plants, and when you did, the encounter would likely be painful.  

On really hot, dry days you would smell pungent, aromatic terpenes and oils exuded by parched vegetation.

Often spiny, or tiny eafed, and rarely ‘leaf-green’. Many have bold, sculptural growth forms characterized by swollen stems or starkly exposed stems unconcealed by foliage.  Also the opposite: Also stems and foliage that are so fine-textured and sparse that the eye tends to look right throughthem. ‘Diaphanous plants’’wisps of sheer delight’

New world cacti and old world succulent euphorbias are great example of convergent evolution.

Fora structures form complex patterns that are more readily traceabe as plants evove. The parts of flowers and fruits are also easier to identify and describe than the vegetative organs.

It is quite difficutl to verbaly explain the leaves different shades of green, degrees of hairiness, and the scalloping of the margins, especially if you lack the minutely detailed vocubalry of the botanist. For example. The terms, pubescen, puberulent, lanate, villous, hirsute, hirsutulous, ciliate, tomentose, strigose, pilose, and hispid, all describe different kinds and dgrees of hairiness. And even difference between individuals of hte same species. 

But flowers and fruints are easier .petals, stamens, and other structures can be counted and lengths and widths measured. The hpoint of attachment of the stamens to the petals can be described unambiguously. For example, a flower that has many petals and sepals that intergrade into one another, many stamens ( hundreds), a two- to mulltilobed stigma, and an ovary enveloped in stem tissue may be unequivaccly identified as belongig to a member of the cactus family. All 2000 plus species of cacti possess some variation of this basic pattern and no other plant group does.

The sepals collectively make up the calyx, they enclose all other flower parts in the bud, usually completely concealing the rest of the flower until it opens. 
The petas collectivey make up the corlla. Petals are visual advertising banner that attracts pollinators. Petals and sepals look similar in many flowers, such as in lilies and agaves. By definition the sepals are the parts on the outside; petals are concealed in the bud stage. When they cant be distnguished, they are collectively called tepals. 

The calyx and corolla make up the perianth. The perianth parts may be separat or fused together for part or all of their length. Often there is only one series of perianth parts. Ut of necessity, these must be on the outside and therefore they are sepals, even if they are large and colorful.

The female part of the flower is the pistil, composed of the stigma, style and ovary. The ovary contains ovules which develop into seeds. Seeds when fertilized by the sperm in poolen. Seeds are plant embryos encased in protective membrane. Usually along with stored energy to fuel germination. If the ovary is visible beneath the calyx, it is said to be inferior. It is superior if you must look inside the flower to see it. 

The male part of the flower is the stamen. Anther and filament. Andthers produce pollen grains, which contain sperm cells.

Almost without exception, living organisms - plants, animals, fungi, and most bacteria - obtain energy for sustaining life from carbohydrates by metabolic process of aerobic respiration - breathing. Respiration is the chemical pathway throuh which carbohydrate is broken down into carbon dioxide and water. 
Photosynthesis is functionally the reverse of respiration; carbon dioxide and water are combined to form the larger molecules of carbohydrate, with the addition of energy from sunlight. Water is absorbed through plant roots, and co2 diffuses into leave through the stomates ( valved poers in the leaf and stem surfaces). 
More on pant respiration pg. 142

Cactus rots in rainforst. Freeze or shaded out by growing plants.

Shindagger. Elephanttree, boojum, creeping devil. Spanish names: dragon’s blood, shild-killer and old man’s head.

Saguros root system radiates as far as the plant is tall. 2 ft cholla may be 30 feet long.

Succulent must guard its water hoard in a dessiccating environment and use it as efficiently as possible. Stems and leaves have waxy cuticles that render them waterproof when the stomates are closed. Few leaves means low surface area (or deciduous in dry season)

Most succulents are spiny bitter or toxic and often all three. Or camoflauged.

Drought tolerant pants often appear to be dead or dying during hte dry seasons. They’re just bundles of dry sticks with brown or absent foliage, reinforcing the myth that desert organisms are engaged in perpetual struggle for survival. But theyo are  not suffering or dying any more than a napping dog is near death; they are simply waitng for rain in their own way. L

Desert foliage comes in many shades, but rarely in typical leaf-green. More often leaves are gray-green, buegreen, gray, or even white. The light color is usually caused ba dense covering of hair-like scales but is soetimes a waxy secretion on the lef or stem surface.  

Leaves or stems with vertical orientations; photosynthetic surface facing sun in morning, when it is cooler and more efficient.  Some cacti create their own shade with a dense armament of spines; teddy bear cholla. 

Plant has male and female organs - androgenous

Flowers can be classified into several polination syndromes.

The hummingbird pollination syndrom is easily recognized. Hummingbirds are large compared with most insects, almost unique in their ability to feed while hovering, and active in daytime. No sense of smell, but they have long, narrow beaks and tongues that can probe deep, narrow tubes, as well as excellent color vision. Humming burd fowers tend to be long-tubular, nonfrangt, sideways or down-facing, day-blooming, and brightly colord. Bees and most other animas cannot easily land on a hanging flower, and even if they succeed they cannot reach the nectar. 

Wind pollinated plants make no investment in attracting animals; their flowers lack fragrance or showy parts. Many people would not recognize them as fowers at all. Prodigious quantities of pollen are released. Conifers, most riparian trees, oaks, and grasses are all wind-pollinated.

Many plants use animals to dispers their seeds in a coevolutionary process as compelex as that of polination.

In the desert some seeds are water dispersed. Blue palo verde grows mostly aong washes. Fash floods disperse the very hard, waterproof seeds downstream, scarifying them in the process. In the absence of scarification these seeds must weather in the ground for a few years before the seed coats become permeable and permit germination.

Showy masses of fruits. 
Spinach beets, sugar beetst,  of economic value.

Pickleweed This plant grows only in the intertidal zone of estuarine salt marshes on the coasts. Grows in pure stands, but few people ever notice this pant since most folks avoid the wet ground where it grows. Wits when it gets rained on. Salt loving plant. Each marsh is an isolated island of saturated saline soil surrounded by dry land and sea. Each estuary has a unique ecotype of pickleweed; differ in such characteristics as plant height seed size, and season of germination. An expert can look at a plant in the lab and tell which estuary it ws collected from.

Palm - shallow roots live near oases. Fruit produced in bunches; each one has a thin, sweet layer of pul covering the large seed. Host plant for the giant palm borer, a thumb-sized beetle up to 2 inches long.. Twig borers. Adults fly during the hottest summer nights, mate and lay hundreds of eggs in the soft tissue near the crown of the palm. The grubs feed on the fibrous trunk tissue with their large mandibles. During their 3 to 10 year larval life they burrow down the trunk, nearly to the ground, then partway back up befor pupating. Heavily infested trees can snap in strong winds. 

Oriols neseting leaves. Paper wasps and bes. Scorpions, spiders in the thatch. Lizards preying on the bugs and hide under the skirts.

Compresses for wound sform macerated pup, jucies from leaves and roots in tonics. But raw sap can cause severe dermatitis. Fish poison and arrow poison.  Soap from the roots.  

Strinkingly banded with many shades of color

Each subdivision of the sonoran desert has at least one common species of bursage that contributes subliminally to the visual character of the landscape.
 Nursepants, seedlings of most desert plants cannot survive the extreme environmental conditions in exposed ground, they must start life in the shelter of another nurse plant. Bursages are one o fhte few plants that can colonize exposed sits; over the succeeding centuries they may be repaced by a series of other species that establishunder one another’s canopies.

Shrubs and subshrubs.

Brittlebush: rain leeches germination inhibiting chemicals out of the leaves and into the soil. For this reason only a few species of annual wildflowers can grow under brittlebushes.

One of the great fables of desert survival is that barrels and other cacti are reservoirs of water that can be easily tapped and drunk. It is true that indigenous peoples and a few desert residents know how to botain emergency water from cacti, but most others dcant do it.

The first problem is getting to teh pulp inside the very tough and spiny epidermis. A pocketknife is inadequate, and tools taht are typically carried in aa car aren’t effective. The labor of cutting into a barrel on a hot day is likely to cause loss of more water from seating that what you would get.
Secondly, the water in cactus pulp is tightly bound in a gooey mucilage. Much of the year the plants are not fully hydrated and teh pulp is more like a damp sponge than a watermelon-  you can’t squeee much liquid out of it. Furthermore, the raw pulp of many cacti is inedibe. Some species have potentially toxic levels of oxalic acid, bitter and sometimes toxic alkaloids, or other substances that cause diarrhea. Or vomiting. The best cactus for emergency water is ferocactus wislizeni. 

See: camp fires on desert and lava by willim t hornaday, chapter 16. Water can be obtained from cacti using a machete and a solar still. But anyone with the foresight to pack these tools is smart enough to carry plent y of water and inform friends ofretun date.

Turk’s head golbular cactus.

Compass barrel - stems always lean in the same direction. Large plants often lean towards the southwest. It has been hypothesized that the intense heat from the afternoon sun retards growth on the southwest side of the plants. Adn the greater growth on the cooler side pushes the plants over.

Eatign its flesh causes nausea diarrhea and temporary paralysis. Us teh pulp as a pain relieving pultice. 


Jointend segments - the elongation fo joints is permanently terminated by the onset of the dry season; new joints branch from areoles.

The formidably spiny flower buds of some chollas are eaten by o’odham and other desert dweilling peoples. The buds are rolled on the ground or another hard surfacewith sticks to remove the spines and glochids. They are pit-roasted for a day and either eaten immediately or dried or pickeld for latery consumption. 

Good for thickening broth.

Cochineal is a scale insect that feeds on prickly pears. Its body fluids contain a bright crimson, foul tasting substance that protects it from predators. Ground cochineal insects were usedby native peoples to dye their textiles rich red or purple, depending on the processing. In europe this color of dye was so rare that only royalty could use it.
Today, red candie beverages, and lipstick are often colored with the blood of bugs raised on prickly pears.

Jumping cholla - many people believe that they really do jump (attracted by the moisture of the animal), and some even claim to have caught them in the act. The truth is that the very sharp spines are so well barbed that even if one barely penetrates tskin or clothing, its grip is stronger than the connectionbetween joints. If you pass a jumping cholla and turn to look when you feel a tug on your clothing, you may see the joint detaching and flying through the air as the elastic recoil of thecloth stnaps it to your flesh. The surprise of seeing a plant moving faster than you.

The easiest wayto remove a cholla joint is to place a comb between it and your skin and quickly jerk it away. Because of the barbs it will take considerable force to dislodge it, and the joint may fly several feet.

Plants require large quantities of four minerals: nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and sulfur. Latter three are present in soil, but nitrogen is an atmospheric gas. Som coil backteria can fix nitrogen ( convert it into nitrate or other water soluble compounds that plants can use). Als decomposition of dead plants and animals. In arid soils especially, where decompostiino of organic material is slow plant growth is often limited by the available amount of soil nitrogen.

Trees with green bark - chlorophyll bearing tissue.

Funnelform white flowers six inches long

creosotebush
The fruit is a small wooly ball that separates into five segments when mature.
The foliage emits a strong aroma, especially after rains. Pungent, but not repulsive. The smell of rain.
O’odham say it was the first plant created. Medicanal. Known as greasewood.


Grasses -
Specialized monocots. Jointed stems, leaves and inflorescences. Jointed sems (culms) are round or flattened (never triangular), the are usually hollow except at the nodes  (points where leaf arise) where they are solid. Leaves generally consist of two main parts: a tubular sheath around the clum and a blade - usually single at each noed but wo-ranked. Small individual flowers (florets) enclosed by two small bracts. A single floret is subtended by two other specialized bracts, the glume. Florets are small and not showy. A wind polinated plant.

Shrubgrass - feed grass for ranchers. Firecycles keep the savannah moving.

Kangaroo rat - can survive without drinking water - gets enough through the metabolization of food.
—this blows dresden’s mind. All living things drink.

Arthropod - armor plating. Expressionless eyes.  Too many legs jointed in too many places.  Abdomen pulses, antennae twitch, tiny oral appendages shift food to the mouth. Lean a little closer and it leaps into the air, almost into one’s face, then veers of on crackling wings.

External skeleton, segmented bodies, jointed appendages; crabs, lobsters, spiders, centipeds, insects. 

Extraordinary diversity of arthropods eclipses the modest radiation of vertabrates.

Articulated skeleton. Hinge to one another at joints. Muscles spanning joints and anchored to different parts of the skeleton.  Skeleton supports weight and resists the stress of locomotion.

The skull and vertebral bones encase the brain and spinal cord, while the ribs protect the heart and other organs. Long bones form the internal core of the limbs. 

Compare animals with skeletons to ‘soft-bodied’ animals. Slugs, snails, and worms. Fleshy, cylindrical bodies without legs, lay full lengtho n the ground. Dependon muscle to retain form and support their weight. 
Skeletons allow for diverse forms.
Move over surface by contracting muscles of the body wall, vs. Using limbs to walk, trot run, leap, brachiate, and fly.

All flying animals must be able to satisfy stringet flight requirements .they must have extensive respiratory systems to supply quantities of oxygen to flight muscles and sophisticated nervous systems to coordinate rapid flight responses. And, of course, functional paris of wings.

An increase in size has physical consequences for any creature. As a an animal doubles in size, its weight increases eightfold, but the weight bearing capacity of its skeleton and the strength of its muscles only quadrubles. Because of their great weight, large vertebrates have skeletons disproportionately heavy and robust.

Presumably, terrestrial arthropods could reach horror-movie size simply by developing big, sturdy skeletons. But they have not done so. It seems that the costs associated with large size affect arthropods more strongly than vertebrates.

For arthropods, possible risk of injury, potentially compromised gas exchange, and complications during molting all become more serious problems at vertebrate like sizes.
As an arthropod gets larger, the proportion of weight attributed to the skeleton will increase faster than it does for a vertebrate. At some point, the advantages of increased size will not compensate for the difficulties associated with a heavy skeleton. 
Without the cushioning effect of soft tissues, a super-sized arthropod’s skeleton is more vulnerable to abrasion and impat damage than the internal skeleton of vertebrates. For example, the weight of any running animal comes down on its small area of feet. Vertebrates have skeletal shock absorbers, such as pads on the undersides of paws, cartilage between joints and vertebrae, and springy ligaments throughout bodies. No significant padding covers an arthropod’s feet, so those small parts of the arthropod skeleton would bear the entire force of impact generated by teh now super-sized owner’s weight, paerhaps fracturing or buckling in response. A simple fall might be even more damaging.

Insects - rely on a complex system of internal tubes for oxygen delivery to tissues. The tubes are part of hte skeletons.

Molting - just after molting an arthropod is essentially a soft-bodied invertebrate. The skeleton is still soft and flexible and does not provide good support. Thus, arthropods must gulp air or water in order to hold their body form until the skeleton hardens. The larger the size, the more difficult this process becomes. Until the new exoskeletonhas hardened, the arthropod is more susceptible to injury and predation. Each time an arthroppod molts it undergoes these risks.

A single plant may be a meal toavertebrate, butto arthropods it can be auniverse. One species might completelarval developmentina flower bud, while another species spends its entirelifefeedingonthe woody stems. A large plantlike the saguarocansuport an entirecommunity of arthropodsthroughout its life and even after death. Other habitats, such as the surface of water and the bodies of other animals.

Outrageous forms. Beautiful forms. 

Primary strategy for dealing with high desert temperatures is avoidance - many animals simply avoid the high daytime temperatures by being nocturnal or crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn). Bobcat, javelina. Noctural birds such as nightjars and owls.
Another strategy is to seek out a cool microclimate. A cactus wren rest quietly in the shade of a jojoba; a prarie falcon will nest on a ledge of a cool north-facing  cliff and and avoid the hot south face. A cool deep crevice in the cliff face for a pallid bat, while a ringtail sleeps the day away in a jumble of rocks at the base of the cliff.
Some mammals create their own microclimates. A white-throated woodrat, or packrat, builds a house madeo f desert litter - cholla joints, prickly pear pads,sticks and sotnes. Looks a little like a trash heap and may be 3 feet high and 8 feet across. At the bottom of this pile a series of tunnels leads to a nest of soft plant fibers.
Brrows.
Large body size actually has its advantages in the hot desert; a large body heats up more slowly than a small body. Thermal inertia. Buy enough time to get through a blistering summer day.

On a hot day, curve-billed thrashers and other birds sleek their feathers, thus creating thinner insulating layer. 
Mammals have radiators - long ears of a jackrabbit. Works when the air is below the jackrabits normal body tempearture.

Evaporative cooling.
Primary method for cooling down. When a coyote pants, it rhytmically moves air over the moist surfaces of the mouth, throat and tongue, evaporation cools these tissues.  Coold blood is then circulated throughout the body.
A hot owl will flap the loos skin under its throat to move air over its mouth cavity. This is called gular fluttering and is the same as panting. 
Brains are sensitive to heat. In sheep, and in dogs and cats, evaporative cooling of the nasal passages results in the cooling of a special network of blood vessels to the brain.
A vulture evacuates its cloacal contents onto its legs if the daytime temperatures are over 70F.  The water evaporates, cooling the legs and drawing more heat from the body. 

Water income and water expense
Stored water is generally limited to what can be placed in the gut or crop. Debts are not tolerated. A 10 to 15 percent  loss in body weight from water loss can impair an animal’s abilit yto recover; a 20 percent loss means death. Water loss can happen quickly on a hot day in the desert - 1 to 2 quarts per hour in humans.
Water income:
Free water ( water hole)
Water in food (eat a juicy mistletoe berry)
Oxidation water ( water produced by all animals when they metabolize food)
Water expense can come from 
Evaporative cooling
Dilution and exretion of wastes
Elimination of feces
Production of eggs or milk.

Some rodents, such as pocket mice and kangaroo rats, are independent of any free water - or even moist food. 
Kang eats dry high carb seeds. Seeds with much fat or high protein are avoided, the former produce too much heat that may have to be lost through evaporative cooling; the latter require toom uch water for diluting waste products. A kangaroo rat can live on oxidation water, but that is only aprt of its arsenal of strategies for desert survival. Additional water is available from dry seeds, which, when stored in its burrow, absorb as much as 30 persent of their weight in water from teh higher humidity in the burrow. The evaporative loss form a kangaroo rat is low, as the animal has no sweat glands and little water is passively lost through its skin. Repirator water loss is reduced by a nasal cooling system that extracts water from air as it is exhaled through the nasal chambers - a cooling system now known to be shared with other rodents and most other mammmals. A kangaroo rat can produce urine twice as concentrated as seawater and feces five times drier than a lab rat’s dropppings. It conserves moisture futher by being nocturnal.

Humans are good at keeping cool but rather poor at conserving water. Weating is the primary method of cooling the body; the evaporation of this sweat from all over the body cools the naked skin. During a really hot day in the desert, a human can lose more than 3 gallons through sweat. 
Blood cooled by evaporation of sewat on the face and head penetrate the skul through tiny emissary veins, thus delivering freshly cooled blood to the brain. This cranial radiator is unique among primates.
Upright, two legged stance also confers some advantages for keeping cool. When the sun is directly overhead, only the head an dshoulders are in full sunlight. Much less radiant heat than four legged animals. Most of the body is raised above the hot desert floor; means rate of heat gain from the desert surface is much less. Being upright also exposes more of the body to cool air currents.
Naked ness - without insulating fur, heat can be lost more easily through convection, and seat more easily evaporated. And that thick patch of hair shades the head and its heat sensitve brain from the sun.

Amphibs and reptiles
Live in fresh water as larvae and can move onto land as adults. Larvae breathe throug hgills, swim with tails, lateral line organs. As they transform into adults, the larvae lose those organs and grow lungs and limbs that are adapted for life on land.
However, the need for an aquatic larval stage and adults water permeable skin prevent amphibians from becoming completely terrestrial and limit radiation into arid habitats. 
Reptiels - waterproof skin and eggs with membrane to prevent dessication.

Tiger salamanders and lowland leopard frogs enter the desert only near permanent ponds, streams or springs. Survive in the desert by burrowing down to moist soil as much as 3 feet deep, where they send 9 to 11 months at a time. 

Reptiles have lower metabolic rates, which generate less internal heat. Reptiles thin skins provide little insulation to retain metabolic heat. But reptile sare erroneously described as ‘cold-blooded.’ In fact, most species maintain fairly high boyd temps when active, by means of behavioral thermoregulation. Alter activity patters according to when environmental temperatures are favorable. Dinural lizards are active in midday in spring and fall, and in early morning and late afternoon during summer. Basking in the sun to absorb heat and scuttle into shade to cool down. Alter solar heat gain by changing body orientation to  the sun, as well as changing color (dark skin absorbs heat faster). Adjust body contact with the surface to regulate heat transfer. 

During times of environmental stress, desert reptiles spend long periods of inactivity in burros, often in those dug by other animals. During brumation in winter and estivation in summer, the inactive animals have greatly reduced metabolic processes. They live on water and nutrients stored in ther bodies. Desert tortoises have large urinary bladder that can store over 40% of their body weight in water. 
During droughts they can reabsorb minerals from their shells. Gila, chuckwalla, and western banded geckos store water in fatty tissue in their tails.
Sidewinders have evolved an unusual form of locomtion in which the body contacts the surface at only two points as it lurches along. The flat-tailed horned lizard and the baja california legless lizard have lost the sand collecting external ear openings presnt in most lizards.  Small eyes, narrow heads, countersunk lower jaws, and very smooth scales - adaptations to swimming and breathing in loose sand. Fringe-like scales on the elongated toes of its hind feet ot give traction across dune surfaces. Wedge shaped head, nasal valves, ridged eyelids, scaly ear flaps, and fine body scales. 


Scorpion - long segmented design is divided into two obvious sections: the elliptical body and the trademark ‘tail’. Body is divided int otwo parts, the cephalothorax and the mesosoma (preabdomen). Cephalothorax contains all sensory, locomotory, and feeding appendages. Two pairs of chlicerae, positioned on either side of the mouth, allow the scorpion ot tear its prey while feeding. pincers are used for snesing as well as holding prey while envenomating and eating.
Sensory hairs on the legs can detect the vibrations of prey up to a foot away. Dorsally, is covered by the carapce. A pair of median eyes atop the carapace, several lateral eyes aranged into two groups along its front edge.
The mesosoma contains the paired genital openings, the spiracle slits that open into the tracheal system allowing the thing to breathe, and the pectines, a pair of comb-licke appendages on the ventral surface that sweep the ground, possible as contact pheromone detectors. 

Bark scorpions display negative geotaxis - that is, they orient themselves upside down - people are often stung by them as they pick up an object and press against a scorpion clinging to the underside. Defensive stinging is a series of quick jabs, after which the scorpion makes a hasty retreat.
Cool, moist air and air flows in dwellings can bring them inside.

Scorps are nocturnal, vetur at night to forage for prey. Stout tail with darkly marked ridges running lengthwise along the underside and a total body length of about 2 inches.

Burrowing deep in the desert soil, the giant hair scorpion often follows the moisture line. As summer progresses and the moisture level in the soil recedes, the scorpion follows it, creating burrows as deep as 8 feet. Defensive posture when threatened, curling its body and tail high overhead and spreading its pincers. The stinging action is swift and well directed.

Predated by elf owls, lizards, and snakes.

As babies are born, they crawl up their mother’s pincers and legs and cling to her back, where they will safely ride until they molt.

Male spiders reach maturity at an earlier age than females. With the exception of tarantuals, spiders typically mate one time during their lives.  The average spider lives for approximately one year, but some of the larger wolf spiders live about two years; and tarantuals may live two decades. 

Females can store sperm up to  year.

Observant hikers in the sonoran desert soon notice grasshoppers jumping near their feet or flitting between bushes and cacti.
Short horned grasshopper vs. Long horned grasshoper.

Long jumping hind legs.

The eggs are laide in clutches ranging from just a few to well over a hundred.

Grasshopers hatch during two separate seasons. Thesmaller winter cohort emerges from the egg stage toward the end of the winter rainy sesason.

Males attracting females by taking short flights, flashing their brightly colored wings, snapping them together or both producing a distinct sound. Short flight noises are called cerpitation; sound usually species specific. Also stridulations made by scraping the hind femoraagainst the forewing.
While hiking in the sonoran desert, one is likely to hear short bursts of clicks emanating from a creosotebush. Comes from male desert clicker. Spends much of its life on a single creosotebush claimed as territory.

Many species of grasshoppers eat a single species of plant - creosotebush.

A large, heavy-bodied flightless grasshopper, the plains lubber.

Pallid-wing grasshopper, populations living on red soil have predoinantly reddish color, those living on white soil are white, and those on dark soil are dark. These differences can be seen over distances of only a few hundred meters.

Soft white bodies with small, dark-colored, hardened head capsules. Soldier termites have enlarged heads with formidable jaws.

Soldier caste with tiny mandibles and a tube-like ‘snout’ arising from the center of the forehead. Debilitate their enemies by squirting them with glue to gum up appendages and other moving parts as an  alternative to biting.

Termites play an essential ecological role in the decomposition and recycling of  celluloseand hemicellulose, the abundant chemicals that giv plant stems and other plant parts their rigidity. They are polymers, long chains of sugar molecules joined together by strong chemical bonds. Another chemical, lignin, fills the gaps between the cellulose and hemicellulose molecules and provides additional chemical strengthening. The cellulose complex represents 50 percent of all the products of photosynthesis and is the most abundant organic material in the world.
Plant fibers, because of their strength, durability, abundance, andresistance to decomposition, have served humans in countless ways for thousands of years: as fule; building materials ( shelter, ships); tools ( hatchet and hammer handles, rope, baskets; fabrics ( cotton, linen, flax); and a medium for storing our ideas ( papyus, paper). We have used plant fibers for almost everything - except food. 
Very vew organisms produce the enzymes required to chemically break down cellulose into the individual sugars that can be used for nutrition. Fungi, single celled protozoans, andbacteria. In the desert, the primary stores of natural cellulose are trees, shrubs, grasses, cactus skeletons, and the dung of animals that eat plant foliage and excrete mostly indegestible fiber. 
For termites, they break it down, but real work of breaking chemical bonds is done by microorganisms in the insect’s guts.

Termites bite off bits of wood, chew them with their mandibles, and thengrind them further with special gizzard-like organs. 

The leave the galleries of the colony

Lots of fat in an ‘alate’ termite. The leave the nest to try to find new colony. They make nutritious food for a wide variety of predators. Spadefoots and insectivorous bats, as well as red velvet mites.  Passerine birds.

All colonies take flight at the same time. Usually after rain. Simultaneous flights. Soon after winged termites alight, they shed their wings by breaking them off at lines of weakness, like perforations in paper, near the point of their attachment to the body females may then release a chemical attractant pheremone to call malles. Males attracted to the substance may be accepted or rejected. The pair mates, then settles into a lifetime monogamous relationship and cooperative family rearing.

Termites can be accurately escribed as ‘tiny social cockaroaches’. Close genetic relationship to wood eating cockaroaches.

Human and termites - mutual vulnerability to heat and desiccation.  Neither could survive without sociality. Both live in complex societies. Shared social behaviors enable both humans and termites to constuct complex structuers that protect from extremes of desert climate. 

Entemologists reserve the name ‘bug’ for those in the order Hemiptera.  Largest order of insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis. United by piercing sucking mouthparts. 
Unique pair of forewings, which are leathery neartheir base and membranous toward the tips.

Body contains a substance called carminic acid. 

Aphids - plant lice.

Beetles - one fifth of all organisms - external skeletons, antennae that detect food, egg-laying sites, temp and humidity. Males especially big antennae to detect pheremones.  Big mandibles. Cut, grind or strain foodstuffs.  
Thorax is the powerhouse of the beetle body, enclosing an internal battery of muscles that power the legs and wings. Thick, leathery forewings or hard and shell-like, to protect delicate flight wings. 

Beetles that remain buried in the sand during the day, where temps are lower.pinacate beetles, stand on their heads. This action precedes the release of a foul, oily fluid from defensive glands located at the tip of the abdomen. Successfully repels most predators. Doesnt stop grasshopper mouse. Simply grabs the beetle with its paws, forcing the tip of the absomen into the sand, and rapidly consumes the tastier head nad thorax, stopping just short of the ill-tasting abdominal defensive glands. 

Beetels avoid predation by mimicry, camouflage, and aposematic (warning) coloration. 

Palo verde root borer looks cool. Pg. 298

Females lay their eggs just below the surface of teh ground on the roots of a variety of native and nonnative trees. The larvae bore through the live roots of the host tree as they consume woody tissue.

C-shaped grubs crawl on their backs, are commonly seen in compost piles, dung heaps, and other accumulations of decaying plant tissues. Construct hardened pupal cells from bits of soil and their own excrement.

Butterflies - lepidoptera. Wings - thousands of tiny overlapping scales, much like tiles on a roof. Each scale is one color, but collective a butterfly’s color pattern is produced by a complex mixture of differently colored scales.

Most butterflys are sedentary, occuring in failry close proximity to their larval food plants.  Sometimes, butterflys wander. 

Egg, caterpillar, chrysalis, adult. - ‘complete metamorphosis’

Inside a pupa, undergoes transformation into a butterfly. Complete metamorphosis

Butterflies are benign aesthetically pleasing faunal members. 

Often flutter thteir weings, even while perched or taking water at puddles.

Butterflies rest wings vertically, moths do so horizontally. Moths are hairy and use a silk cocoon.

Some caterpillars made poisonous due to what they eat.

Gossamer winged butterfly - true jewels of the insect world. Smally - western pygmy-bllue littlemore than 1/2 an inch from wingtip to wingtip. 

Skippers - named for their rapid- skipping flight. Small, larger bodies. Broader heads, hooked antennae that continue past the clubs rather than ending at them. Resemble oths, hairy.

Moth vs butterfly 
- winged creature of the night.

Moths from different families vary widely in the venation, shape, and coloration of their wings; larval and adult feeding habits and behaviors; mating systems, populationstructures, and thermal biology; and sies, ranging from the minute clothes moth, ,with its 1/4 to 3/8inch wingspread to the batsized hawk moths and giant silk moths.  

Caterpillas are highly specialized and eat only one or a few plant species. Destruction of wool clothing and sotred grains by moths of the family tineidae. The repeated association of certain moth and butterfly lineages with specific families of host plants represents an ancient arms race.
Complex swuites of plant defenses, chemical (terpenoids, alkaloids, phenolics, cyanide and physical - hairs, spines, tough leaves, oozing resins, and latex. 
Humans owe a debt of gratitude to moths and other insects for such biochemical plant wealth, which, quite coincidentally, provides us with a pharmacopoeia of natural drugs, insecticides aflavors, and fragrances.
Caterpillars - detoxification or rapid excretion of plant toxins to avoidance of older, better defendedl eave. 
Larvae avoid snipping the veins of tobacco leaves, thusreducing the amounts of nicotine marshaled by the plant in its defense. Some specialized caterpillars co-opt the  toxins from their host plants for their own defenses and advertise their acquired distastefulness with bright, vivid colors.


When caterpillars remain undaunted by chemical or physical deterrents, plants may use extra floral nectaries or other foodstuffs to purchase the services of ants and wasps as caterpillar exterminators. These security guards can be bribed, however, and certain caterpillars do so by offering secretions of sugars or amino acids. 
Caterpillars on leaves are vulnerable. The scents of wounded leaves and grass, the by-products of caterpillar foraging, are attractive to the many species of wasps and flies that parasitize caterpillars. Preyed on by birds, wasps, andother visually foraging predators. 
To survive, they defend themselves by being distasteful, by covering themselves by stinging spines, or through bluff and deceit. They mimic leaves,twigs, galls, flower buds, bird droppings, and even snakes.

Caterpillars that defoliate desert wildflower, crop plants, and garden vegetables eventually become nectar-feeding adult moths that render important pollination services to many of the same plants.

Most night-blooming, moth pollinated plants employ alt methods of reproduction. Self-pollination, recruiting other dinural pollinators, or simply waiting for the next flowering season. Moths ar opportunistic, dont just stick to plants the rquire pollination.

Notable exception is yucca flower and the small, white moths that live most their lives with th eplants. Active pollinators, dont just do it as a byproduct of feeding, they intentionally polinate. Do it so that plants have developing seeds in  the stigmatic cavity for the eggs to feed on. ‘Nursery pollination’
Nursery pollination is rare - but there is anotherin the sonoran -  small moth and the senita (pg. 306)

Black witch moth.
Movement of thousands of greenandblackstriped hornworms across the desert floor provides one of the most memorable images of the summer monsoon.

Bats. Bats eat moths, number one predator. 
Moths develop sensitive ears to hear the hunting cries of bats and attempt to avoid them.
High speed clicks that poisonous moths let bats know they’re poisonous.


Moths mostly communicate via pheremones - most aren’t so vibrant cause they’re out at night.

Attraction of moths to light. No better way to gain an appreciation for the diversity of moths than by setting out a strong ultra-violet or mercury-vapor light, hung over a white sheet. D
Some of these nectar drinkers also tipple at flowing sap or rotting fruit.
Mix old beer, rotting ruit, and molasses and let it brew in a warm, dark place. When the concotion becomes pungent, paint or splash it onto tree trunks along a trail at dusk, then return after dark with a lantern. Large underwing moths, ants, crickets, and millipedes.

Hawk moth with 4 inch long probiscis. 

Plants with bunches of small tubular flowers, such as willowherba nd fairy duster, attract many owlet and inchworm moths. Spend up to 20 minutes perched on a single inflorescence, drinking leisurely from each flower. 

Night blooming, fragant plants.

In the southwest, as in most places, chances are good that if you find an unfamiliar caterpillar, it will grow up to be a moth. This is especially true for caterpillars that mine (eat tunnels) within leaves, bear stinging spines, and spin plush silken cocoons. 
Can be raised in jars, terraria, or even plastic bags, as long as food is removed regularly. 

Bees
Nest in abandoned tunnels in dead trees and limbs from emerging beetles.

Carpenter bee is bad ass.

Wasps comprise an enormous and diverse assemblage of insects ranging from the smallest known insects - tiny parasites of insect eggs - to immense cicada killers and tarantual hawks.
Most wasps are predators, but some are vegetarians .
Paper wasps- build paper honeycomb nests.

Tarantula hawk - hunt for tarantulas.
Drawing on pg. 318

Ants pg 320

The period of colony founding, whenthe new queens mst fly, mate, locate a good nest site, and avoid predators, is when most colonies fil and die. Only a few will survive. - potential for new story.

Army ants, raid the nests of other desert ants and beetles, crickets other insects. They are nomadic, no permanent quarters, move from place to place, once they deplete prey in one location.

Latticework of spines

Carve off a piece of the tough outer skin of a decaying saguaro and you’ll find the innards teeming with life. Move the whole saguaro and spiders and other rathropods race from beneath.  1 cubic foot had 413 individual arthropods ; adult and larval beetles, larval flies, pseudoscorpioins, and mites.
Draws predators too. Red beetles, easy to spot these hungry terrors of the insect world as they stalk their prey through the saguro rot. 

Some rivers are spring fed and flow only a short distance before sinking into the earth.
Mayflies, midges, etc.

At any one time there are flying adults, an ‘air force’ ready to repopulate the desert aquatic environment when the stream waters return.summer drought may dry most of the stream, but pockets of aquatic habitat remaining in canyons or springs support residual populations that emerge when waters return. 
The abundant light in most desert streams suports the growth of algae, microalgae, bacteria and fungi. Wheich feed ‘graxer-scrapers’. Riparian plants drop leaves and other debris, which sustain ‘shredders’. 

Riffles are created when water flows rapidly over shallow rocks, causing turbulence and roiling the surface. In riffles, insects must be able to hold on. Mayfly nymphs are long and streamlined for lessened resistance to the force of moving water as they cling to rocks, plants, or other substrates. Feed on diatoms and fine organic material.

Larvae of the hydropsychidae caddisflies use silk to construct tent-like nets in fast water. The net is open upstream to capture food particls while the insect stays hidden.

Tinajas - pools formed in bedrock where water or other erosive forces have carved out depressions that fill when it rains.
Tinajas can hold impressively diverse biotic communities with the types of roganisms determined by the depth and duration of the ools, chemical composition of the water, and proximity to other aquatic habitats. Ooplankton - feed on suspended microalgae and organic material. Most are crustacea and are quite small, such as water fleas. Cyclopoida. Swim injerky motions in search of suspended particles, which they sweep into their mouths with speciallied mouthparts bearing hairs as natural sieves. 
Fairy shrip, looks like an opaque inch-long shrimp swimming on its back using a row of many legs modified as paddling structures. 
Adult insects that fly in from mmore permanent waters. 

Currents carry a soup of drifting organisms from fast water into slower areas where they are vulnerable to a remarkable abundance of predatory insects. Some niteresting ones are in teh order hemiptera. Water scorpion perches like a praying mantis on aquatic plants or other debri. Extends a siphon from the tip of its abdomen to breath air from the surface. To-biters often sit among the stream-edge plants. Swim along the bottom, frey on snails.  Dragonflys and damselflys.
Some dragonfly nymphs dart through the water out of their rectums - like jet propulsion. 
Some gomphids hide just under the sand, waiting for vibrations otindicate that prey is coming by. Quiver your hand over clean, shallow sand and watch for movement of this hidden insect.

Surface film
Neuston is the collective term for organisms that live at the water surface. Water striders  prey on terrestrial insects that fall on the water surface.
Beetles of the whirligig family have a split view of their neustonic world: the upper portion of their eyes seeks prey floating on the surface, while the lower pair seaches for prey below. Often spin madly at the surface in groups.

Midge and mayflies swimming up to the surface and burst out of their pupal or larval skins, rest for a moment, then fly off to be adults.  This is the hatch that fly fishers try to mimic. 

Stream margins - littoral one
Flattened bugs, almost disk shaped. Crawl on sand and gravel in shallow water. Muscular front legs. Hodld prey. Toad bug - mottled and squat with bug-eyes. 
This is the zone where many insects leave the water and hatch as adults. During warm months, caddisflies, having gone through their pupal stages under rocks, come to the edge to break open their skins, crawl out, and dry off their wings. Orang mites come from nowhere to climb onto an emergin caddisfly and 
hitch a ride - means of dispersal. 
Spent skins of bugs that can seen streamside from spring through fall. The eggs of baetids are often observed on the undersidesof stones. 

Midstream


Flocks of black-bellied whistling ducks often feed on waste grain in harvested fields, as well as seeds in grasslands and overgrwon pastures; insects and other invertebrates make up a small part of their diet.

Quail - plump birds, poor fliers, spend almost all their time on the ground. Make themselves unobtrusive to avoid drawing notice. Terrestrial birds with short round wings, stout legs with 4 toes. Short conical bills. 

Grebes are swimmers that are more graceful underwater than in the air. Heron standing at the water’s edge to spear or sieze fish, frogs and other aquatic creatures. 

Short, blunt bill, encircled with a blackband. Feet set far back on its baody, which makes travel on land awkward but ideal for underwater swimming. Seldom seen flying.

It has an interesting behavior when nervous: it expels air fom its lungs and feathers, which causes it to slowly sink in the water; it then swims with only its head breaking the water surface.

Vultures are perfectly adapted for living on carrion. They may have to wait for a few days between meals, so the expend little energy soaring for hours with scarcely a flap of their broad wings. Keen eyesight, well developed sense of smell. Naked heads for tearing into carrion. 

Rails. Inhabit marshes. Dense marshes and are seldom seen as they slip among the cattails and other aquatic plants. Coots are relatives that act like ducks, swimming and diving freely on open water. Gallinules behave like either, . Distinctive voice, rails call mostly at night, in keeping with theeir secretive nature.

When swimming, pump their heads back and forth aas they go. 

Rails have narrow bodies for running through marsh vegetation.

Thin as a rail is about the bird ,not barriers.

Shorebirds do most foraging along the water’s edge, probing in soft mud or picking at the surface in search of tiny invertebrates.

Members of the plover family have distinctively short bils and short necks, when foraging they often run a few steps and then pause, and then run a few more, stopping now and then to pick up something from the ground. Although many .

Adults defend eggs or chicks with a repertoire of distraction displays. All three birds are good runners and strong fliers.

Small towns, ranch houses, towns.

Doves fast fliers and noisy, as they clap their wings together when the ystart into flight. Nests are flimsy, careless arrangements.

Loud, rasping screech.

Bats are lunarphobic.

Nests made of their own saliva, which hardens to a substance resembling shellac (nests separate into gelatinous shreds when soaked or cooked, source of bird’s nest soup)

On cold nights, when the costs of keeping warm are especially hihg, it may be too risky for a humming bird to even keeps its engine idling. At such times, a hummingbird bristles its feathers to let its body heat escape, and its temperature quickly approaches that of its surroundings. Its heart reate drops dramitcally and it may stop breathing for minutes at a time.  It appears lifeless, clinging motionlessly to its branch with its head drawn close to its body and its bill pointing sharply upward. At daybreak it revs its metabolic engines and warms itself again. Temporary ibernation is called torpor.  Becoming torpid conserves water.

When hunting they use rapid wingbeats and hover in one spot before plunging to catch their prey.

Flycatchers - dawn songs - wide flat bills with bristles.

Male ravens tumbling in the sky, swooping, soaring to impress females, its not even a metaphor. The same spark impulse.

Hardy and adaptable, they are active on the hottest days and the coldest winter mornings. Most common in thick mesquite bosques, they also range out onto open flats, where plant life is sparse. Insects and nectar. 

Loud, rapid whistling.

Active and inquisitive little brown birds, wrens spend their days snooping about ,pering into shadows, and prying with their thin bills, seeking the insects on which they feed. If often hard to see, they are easy to hear. Male wrens are inveterate singers.

Flit to the top of an exposed stub to sing his muscal trills.

Diminutive birds that hop and flit among the foliage, flippig theii rlong tails about as they seek tiny insects. 

Open cup nest.

The members of the family mimidae - the mockingbirds, catbirds, and thrashes - are songbirds truly worthy of the name. Some of them, especially the mockingbirds, borrow phrases from other birds - or from other sounds in their surroundings - but hey work them into imporvisations that are rich and musical, or at least interesting.
Although a couple of species are common in eastern gardens, and various types of mockingbirds occur throught the americas, the family reaches ts greatest development in the arid southwest. There are some places where 5 diff species can bef ound in the same patch of desert. Difference in the shapes of their bills reveal different feeding habits, allowing coexistence. For example, the crissal thrasher, thrashing the soil with its big sickshaped bill, acan root out insects that are unavailable for the short-billed bendire’s thrasher.

Whit-wheeting from prominent perches.

Often heard singing on moonlit nights.
 
Yellow eyes and a melodious warble that continues at length with some repititon.

Northern mockingbird forages by walking or running on the groundo or flying dwon to the ground from a perch often opening and closing its wings, a behaviour that causes insects to take flight.

Mistletoe is a parasitic plant, growing on the branches of trees, it is planted there by the actions of birds. When birds eat its berries, the seeds often pass unharmed through their digestive systems; if the birds dropping happen to land on a suitable branch, the seeds may stick long enough to germinate. The phainopepla, by specializing on the berries of desert mistletoe, is unwittingly planting its own future food supply. 

Warblers, butterflies of the bird world, flit through the foliage, from treetop to understory, in search of small insects. 


Over 1200 bat species account for about one-fiffth of the world’s mammal fauna! Global bat diversity is due in large part to the length of time bats  have been on earth. Bats were flying through the night skies over 50 million years ago. Fossil bats are very similar to those that exist today. Early bats lived at a time when the predecessors of the horse was small, three-toed, fox-like animals trotting around in eocene swamps.
Species range in size from giants with 6-foot wingspans to lilliputians that weigh less than a penny. Some bats are jet black and some are snow white; others have pelts from yellow, orange, and red through blue-gray. Almost every mammalian feeding strategy. Some are herbivores that visit planst and survive on flower nectar or fruit, and some even feed on leaves. Insectivorous bats hunt flying insects or pluck stationary insects off the ground or foliage. Some bates are ture carnivores that catch lizards, frogs, small rodents, birds, and even other bats. Adaptations that allow the to fish for small minnows and aquatic invertebrates. Only three species are true vampires, surviving on the blood of other animals.

Bats are not the dirty disease carriers they are made out to be, nor are they blind or likely to get tangled in one’s hair. 

White-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease that affects hibernating bats and is caused by a fungus, Pseudogymnoascus destructans, or Pd for short. Sometimes Pd looks like a white fuzz on bats’ faces, which is how the disease got its name. Pd grows in cold, dark and damp places. It attacks the bare skin of bats while they’re hibernating in a relatively inactive state. As it grows, Pd causes changes in bats that make them become active more than usual and burn up fat they need to survive the winter. Bats with white-nose syndrome may do strange things like fly outside in the daytime in the winter. 

Flaps and folds of flesh around the mouth, often set off by large, obvious hairs or wihiskers.  It is suspected that these oral structures help focus their echolocation calls or perhaps funnel insects into their mouths. Long, narrow wings and are fast flyers ,typically hawking insects, near pond surfaces. 
In some species the wings are joined together at the dorsal surface of their backs, along the spine, increased surface area of the wing membranes and, thus, help the bat dissipate heat.

Hibernation allows bats to survive long winters when insect prey is not available.
When a bat hibernates, its body temperature drops to that of its surroundings and its metabolism slows to a mere fraction of its active rate. Big brown bats hibernate at or just below freezing. By lowering their body temperatures to such an extreme, these bats burn stored fat reserves very slowly. 

Gaff them from the water surface with its huge clawed feet.

Some moths use toracic ears or vibration sensitive palps to listen for the ultrasonic calls of bats, and they take evasive action by flying about erratically or diving into shrubbery.

Research on the common brazilian free tailed bat, indicates that it is an important predator of costly crop pests. In central texas, free-tailed bats consume large quantities of migratory moths whose larvae attack cotton and corn.

Coyote
Native amarican myths - trickster or wise one.

Gray fox - the only canid that regularly combs trees. It hunts and sometimes sleeps in trees. Napping in the arms of a saguro.

Leaf-like folds and flaps on their face, forming megaphones that likely amplify and direct their echolocation calls. 
Ghost-faced bats are insane.

Guano is mined as nitrogen-rich fertilizer.

Not all bats use caves. Some trees, roosting in natural hollows and cavities or holes excavated by other animals. Exposed cliff and rock crevices.

Bats are facing a housing shortage; pg. 403

Leaf-nosed bates have a triangular fleshy growth of skin, called a noseleaf, protruding above the nose. All three leaf-nosed bats of the sonoran desert weigh between 0.4 and 0.7 ounces.

The nectarivorous bats have long, slender snouts and long, extensible tongues with brush-like tips for lapping nectar. Flowers for bats are frequently bowl-shaped and sturdy, are usually at the top of the plants or far out on limbs, so that bats can easily get to them wit hout become tangled in thorny vegetation. 

Little whispering signals that can be heard no more than 3 ft away. 

The ears of euderma and corynorhinus are rolled up around the head when the bat is a t rest and then inflated with blood when the bat is active. 


Mustelid
Weasel family - badgers skunks, otters, ferrets and weasels.

Plantigrade hind feet, giving them a distinctive waddling and shuffling gait.

The badger is renowned for its power, tenacity and irascible temperament. A badger once attacked a tractor that rano ver its den entrance.

Its eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes (transparent third eyelids) which protect the eyes from flying dirt while the  badger is digging. Small well-furred ears also help.

Skunks are rather phlegmatic animals. They seem to be aware that they have a daunting weapon for almost any situation, and they show great forbearance. 
Skunks find their own odor offensive; a skunk is reluctant to spray if restricted from getting its tail out of the way. 

Badgers are avid diggers, they sniff out rodents or other prey and excavate them from their burrows faster than the little creatures can dig to escape. 

Their dens don’t smell like skunk spray, but they do have a distinctive, strong, musky odor. Although they don’t hibernate, skunks gain extra weight in the fall, which tides them over the lean times during the winter. 

No other animal evokes the maesty and awe of wild north america as much as does the mountain lion. The lion is shy and elusive, but we find their tracks, scats, and the remains of kills they’ve made.  Most people will never see a mountain lion in the wild, however, because it is a master of camouflage; it can fvanish behind a bush or rock or scrap of shadow.

In the sonoran desert, lions spend their days resting in thick, brushy canyons, rocky outcrops, mine shafts, or any secluded place that provides sufficient cover.

Its an efficient predator. It often slams into the prey animal with such force that the prey is knocked off its feet. A bit to the back of the neck or to its throat ends things quickly. 

After feeding, the cat scrapes up leaf litter or debris to cover and hide the kill, then returns each day to feed until the prey is consumed. A single adult lion without kittens usually needs to make a kill every 6 to 10 days.

Hooves are specialized claws or toenails. Adaptations for running to escape predators.  Living in a group is a bonus since there are many sets of eyes watching for predators.

Ruminatns, even-toed, cud-chewing animals.

Javelina chew as they walk so bits and pieces fall from their mouths, sometimes leaving a short trail.

Near the rear of a javelina’s back, usually hidden beneath the bristly hairs, is a small organ producing an oily liquid with a strong and unmistakable odor. This musky perfume helps maintain social life.  From time to time, pairs of animals stand nose to tail and rub their heads across each other’s scent glands. As a result of this frequent contact, every javelina herd develops its own distinctive group scent. 

Rabbit - compensate for for heavy predation by reproducing at a prodigious rate. 

Altricial

Twigs nipped off by jacks have clean, slanted cuts, while ends bitten by cottontails may have a neat cut or a rougher, nibbled appearance.  Twings browsed by deeer look pinched off. 

Mothers stay away from the nest so as not to alert predators, returning only once or twice each night to nurse the babies. In two weeks the little rabbits leave the nest.
Rabbits live about two years, if they’re lucky.

When a jack suspects a predator is nearby it often stands on hind legs to get a better view, then crouches down and freezes. If the predator gets too close, the jack springs up, leaping away in 15-foot bounds. After a few leaps the jack jumps even higher as it sails over bushes and other obstacles and tries to spot the predator. 

Fossorial - dig burrows for shelter

It holds its arced tail over its back, shadowoing itself as it forages. 

When a rock squirrel encounters a snake, it stamps its feet and tries to push sand or dirt into the snake’s face with its  front paws.

A gohpers fur can lie in either direction, allowing for streamlined backward travel. 


Kangaroo rats are mainly bipedal; their short forelegs usually touch the ground only when they’re foraging. The long tail is used as a counterbalance while hopping, especially during sharp turns.

This mighty river’s watershed drains more than 246,000 square miles of land in the west. 

While these channels are largely unchanged as they pass through deep headwater canyons, when they reach more gentel terrain and flow through broad valleys these streams typically have been altered dramtically by human activities. Many streams have dried, and their associated riparian areas hav disappeared because of irrigation diversion and channelization.  Few remaining streams still support large populations of native fish. 

Fingerlings - fish about as long as a finger.

Adult spadefoots burrow into moist soil to avoid heat and desiccation, and emerge to feed and breed only on rainy nights. 

Spadefoots emerge from their suberranean estivation to breed in temporary ponds created by the runoff from summer storms. Interestingly, the cue for emergence is not moisture; it is low-frequency sound or vibration of rainfall or thunder.

Toxic - violent sneezing and discharge from the eyes and nostrils from the prolongued handling of this animal. Broken skin stings on contact.
Spadefoots burrow into the moist soil by moving their hind feet in a circular motion, essentially drilling themselves down. They appear to sink down into the earth; the soil closes on top of them so there is no open burrow.

Sighting of the toad means rains are coming soon. 
Idea of mandrameen killing the ayramun’s toad.


Eyelids edged in white. Belly somewhat translucent.  Males have prominent spurs on both sides of the body at the base of the tail.

Fat tail serfves as more than a way to escape predation. It stores fat, which can be broken down into water and carbs during lean times. 

Most sonoran desert lizards use a variety of behaviours in a purely social context. Displays to establish dominance or territory or to aid in courtshop. Head bobs. Open bouthed cape and vertical extension of the body and throat of collared lizards. Four-legged push ups and brightly colored dewlap of tree lizards. Subtle shudders of the body. 

Studded skin - beaded look of the dorsal scales, small bones within the skin. 

Venom is produced in teh salivary glands in the lower jaw and expressed along grooved teeth as the lizard bites. Intense and immediate pain. Before biting, the lizard will hiss, gape, and back away from its would-be attacker if . Once it bites, it generally holds ona nd chews the venom into the aggressor.  Rarely fatal, but may cause pain, edema, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and accelerated heart rate.

‘The gila monster is venomous because it lacks an anus and ‘all that stuff went bad in there’; ‘if it bites you, it has to turn upside down to get the venom in you’.



Tan or brown reticulated pattern on teh back and sides. Keeled scales runs down teh center of the back. Rows of brwon spots on the tail, which is as long as the body from snout to vent. 

Eats insects, carrion, and fecal pellets of its own species. Pellets aid the digestion of plant cellulose by establishing the proper gut flora. 

Large heat with prominent jaw muscles. In breeding season, spots and bars of bright red or orange appear on the sides of the female’s body.

Running swiftly on their hind legs, the body held of fthe ground at a 45-degree angle, with tail and forelimbs raised. 

Metachromatism, color change as a fuction of temperature. Coolor, colors are darker, than when temps are high. For obvious reasons.

Colored throats. Throat folds.

Arboreal lizard, in alder and cottonwood.

Squat, flat, toad-like bodies and thorn-like proections at the rear of their heads. 

Rattlesnake venom is one of the most complex substance known (toxic saliva) a misxture of enzymes unique to pit vipers that destroys blood and tissue and paralyzes nerves. Rattlesnake fangs are movable hypodermic syringes. 
Dual visual systems. In addition to their eyes, they ahave sensory organs in their faces that allow them  to ‘see’ infrared images. 

Nocturnal only during summer months.

Look under before picking up or stepping on or around.

Dont lift objects by placing your hand under them. Use a tool to lift ojbects, don’t use your hand. Lift the far side of the object; lifting hte near side may place your feet in striking range.

VITAE PATRUM

although there are many who will repeat all sorts of stories as the whim takes them, such as that Paul was only a man covered in hair right down to his feet living in a hole in the ground, and other invented tales too tedious to trouble with. Such impudent lies need to be refuted.

To be put to the sword for the name of Christ was held to be a true Christian sacrifice. But the enemy wanted to subdue the soul even more than the body, and they invented ingenious, lingering ways of putting people to death. As Cyprian, who suffered like that, said, 'Although they wanted to die, death was withheld from them'. I shall give you a couple of examples of this so that the cruelty of it may be more thoroughly understood.

There was one particular martyr who persevered victoriously in the faith through tortures by racks and hot metal plates, so they ordered him to be smeared all over with honey and laid him out in the heat of the sun with his hands tied behind his back, hoping that even though he had survived the hot frying pan he might succumb to the burning pain of the insect bites.

They ordered another young man in the flower of his youth to be taken into a most pleasant little garden, with white lilies and red roses, and a gentle murmuring stream winding through it, and the wind making a sweet whisper though the leaves of the trees, where they made him lie down on a feather bed, and left him there, tied down with soft silken bonds to prevent him escaping. After they had all gone a beautiful prostitute came in, and began stroking his body in the most delicate of embraces, and, shameful to relate, fondling his manhood in her hands, in the hope of so inciting him to lust that she might win a shameless victory over him. I don't know how this soldier of Christ did it, or how he summoned up his resolve. But will pleasure be the victor where torments fail? For at length, inspired by heaven, he bit off his tongue and spat it in her face as she tried to kiss him. And so the immense pain which followed was stronger than the feeling of lust. 

, he came at last upon a rocky mountain with a large cave at the foot of it and a large stone over the entrance. After removing the stone and going in, eager to explore the unknown with a human curiosity, he found a spacious chamber, with an opening to the sky above covered over by spreading branches of an ancient palm tree. There was a sparkling spring there, from which a stream overflowed through a little opening, and soaked away into the earth. There were also a few little buildings near the foot of the mountain containing the knives and anvils and mallets used to strike coins; Egyptian writings tell us that this used to be the site of a secret minting factory at the time when Antony and Cleopatra were together.

Accepting gratefully this dwelling which God had given him, he began to spend his time in prayer and solitude. The palm tree provided him with both food and clothing. And lest you think that is impossible, I call Jesus and his holy Angels to witness that in that part of the desert next to the Saracens of Syria I saw myself one of the monks who had been enclosed for thirty years living on barley bread and muddy water. There was another living in an old water cistern, in the pagan tongue of the Syrians known as a cuba, who survived on five dried figs a day. Such things might seem unbelievable to those outside the faith, but all things are possible to those who do believe.

But then Hilarion found himself unwilling to put up any longer with the numbers of people coming to Antony seeking help to overcome their passions and various attacks of the demons. He said that as he was a desert dweller it was not right that he should be surrounded by crowds of city people. So Hilarion all the more decided that just as Antony was now a strong man enjoying the rewards of victory, so it behoved him to start as Antony had done.

'He who has not renounced everything he has cannot be my disciple' (Luke 14.33). 

He wore a tunic of sackcloth, with an over-garment of skins which Antony had given him as a parting present, and he also had a rough blanket

suggesting how his pubescent body could be aflame with unlooked for pleasures. This little Christian novice was compelled to think about things which he had never thought about before, and a whole parade of ideas flooded through his mind about things of which he had had no experience. He got angry with himself and beat his breast with his fists as if he could drive his thoughts away by physical blows.
&quot;You little donkey!&quot; he said to his body, &quot;I'll see to it that you don't trample me underfoot. I'll not give you any barley. Nothing but chaff! I will tame you by means of hunger and thirst, I will weigh you down with heavy burdens, I will subject you to both cold and heat! So you will end up thinking of nothing but food instead of lust!&quot;

Every three or four days he maintained life in his gradually weakening body by the juice of herbs and a few figs. He prayed and sang psalms constantly, and cultivated the earth with a mattock, matching the labour of his fasting to the labour of his physical work.

At night he began to hear squalling babies, bleating sheep, bellowing cattle, wailing women, roaring lions, marching armies, and the noise as of an approaching horde of barbarians, striking terror into the heart just from the sound of it, even before coming into sight. But he understood that these were all tricks of the demons, and he flung himself down, making the sign of the cross of Christ on his forehead. Protected by that helmet and by the breastplate of faith he battled all the more strongly as he lay there, looking about here and there, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever it was that was so frightening to listen to. Suddenly, without any warning, he could see in the light of the moon a four-wheeled chariot with frenzied horses bearing down upon him. He called on Jesus, and suddenly the whole terrifying spectacle was swallowed up into a hole in the ground before his very eyes.


From the age of sixteen till he was twenty the sun and the rain kept on beating down on the little shelter he had made for himself out of reeds and grasses. Then he made a little cell for himself, which remains to this day, four feet wide and five feet high. That was much lower than his own height, though it was a bit longer than his body fully stretched out. As you can imagine, it was more like a coffin than a house. He did cut his hair, to be sure, once a year at Eastertide, but to the day of his death he slept on a bed of rushes laid upon the bare earth. Once he had put his sackcloth on he never washed it. It was quite superfluous to wash your clothes, he said. Nor did he change his other garment until it had been reduced to rags. When not reciting the prayers and psalms as if he were in the presence of God, he kept the holy Scriptures in his mind. But since there is a lot to tell you about his great deeds through all the stages of his life, I will first of all summarise his various regimes for you, before returning to the order of my tale.

 From thirty to thirty-five his food was half a loaf of barley-bread and a little bit of vegetable cooked without any oil. At this point he found that his eyes were becoming misty and his whole body began to burn with a sort of rough and scabrous impetigo, so he added a little oil to his diet and continued in this abstemious regime till the age of sixty-three, with no fruit, no pulse or anything tasty. When he felt that his body was getting weaker and the end of his life was getting near, he gave up bread, so that from his sixty-fourth year till the age of eighty, with incredible strength of mind, it was as if he were coming anew to the service of God, at an age when others begin to be a bit more relaxed. He would make a sort of weak broth of flour mingled with oil, and weight out about five ounces of it, to serve for both food and drink. And he went on like this, never eating before sunset, never relaxing his fasting, not even for holy days or when he was ill.

where there was a woman who felt herself to be despised by her husband, because although they had been married for fifteen years she had not borne him any children. She was the first person bold enough to invade the privacy of the blessed Hilarion. Without fear or mistrust she embraced his knees.
&quot;Forgive my boldness,&quot; she said, &quot;but please listen to my troubles. Why are you looking away? Why try to run away from someone who needs your help? Don't look at me as a woman, but just as someone utterly miserable. Don't forget that it was my sex who gave birth to the Saviour, and 'it is not the healthy who need a physician but the sick' 

The disease may have been caused by something in the air, or perhaps (as was afterwards made plain) simply in order that the name of Hilarion, the servant of God, might be glorified. For when she was told that there was a monk in the neighbouring desert, she hardly needed any persuasion from her husband to lay aside all her dignity of state and act simply like a mother. She mounted a mule, and accompanied by servants and eunuchs made her way to Hilarion.

And who could remain silent about Maiumites of Gaza? He was gathering stones for building from the seashore not very far away from the monastery, when he suddenly became completely paralysed. His working companions carried him to the Saint and he was then able to return to work immediately! Remember also the beach along the border between Palestine and Egypt. Although naturally soft, it had become hardened by the grains of sand solidifying into small stones. But little by little, although it still looked like gravel it no longer felt like gravel.

 The surrounding country had been suffering from a drought for the previous three years, and the people said that even the elements were mourning the death of Antony. Hilarion's fame was well known to the farmers round about, and both men and women, their lips bloodless and their bodies wasted with hunger, urgently begged the servant of Christ, as the successor of the blessed Antony, to pray for rain.

            <Title>Stolen from Myself</Title>
            <Text>Space began to fold around them, and the whole structure moved forward, imperceptibly at first, but soon enough the stars at the sides began to stretch, and the plasma out in front sputtered into a steady flame. Beyond this point Moto was not able to construct a coherent sequence of events.
To outside observers, the Experiment’s movement looked strange - the ship’s translation over time adhered to a curve which only appeared in abstract mathematics. It was an unnatural function, with no elegant smoothing in and out, no sense of natural timing that one normally associates with Newtonian physics. It was like the ship was being summoned  into the depths of the cosmos by some capricious deity who liked to play with his food before he ate it.
Inside the crew could sense movement, somehow, yet there was no inertial velocity, no fixed reference points to judge progress, as almost immediately stars faded into the dark. Oya, Moto, and Alberto just floated there in their harnesses, measuring out light years per second.
As the Experiment folded the fabric of the universe around itself in greater and greater bolts, the bright plasma spread out into a bubble around the ship. As it stretched, its hot blue color shifted through to purple, then settled into a deep, suffocating red. As this light flooded into the command module it bounced around the interior with an intensity that seemed to ignite the controlled atmosphere of the cabin, the red light seemingly taking on substance, adhering to surfaces. Edges seemed to merge into each other, and soon Moto could not distinguish between interior and exterior. He tried to hold focus by reading out the distance measurements from his console, committing them to memory - but the apparent melting of the display just magnified the sensation of his mind’s disassembly. Dark, shifting patterns raced over the contours of the cabin’s interior, a mesmerizing effect, and Moto entered into a familiar psychedelic trance in which static and moving things merged into a third state, the ___ in which the artificial construction of reality that occurs within the brain begins to atrophy. Moto just sat there like a newborn, wide-eyed, a sense-organ with no thought..
Eventually it all began to dim, and the plasma began to dissipate, taking with it the deep crimson light that had consumed the crew. Moto began to sense the rigidity of the outer rings again, and this in turn resolved that familiar ‘whump-thump’ of their passing overhead, and to this Moto was able to reorient his sensibilities. The ship was quickly scaling back down the hyperbolic curve from which it had come.
It took another moment still for it to come to a complete stop, and for Moto to begin to coax his rational mind back out of its shell. He could see that Alberto was still lost in rapture, while Oya had already regained her faculties and was busy doing… something. Moto’s eyes turned back out to the spatial void, stumbling over a dark planet which nearly filled the frame. It shocked him to see it, because it was very large, and very close, and it had somehow escaped his notice despite him staring at it just before. It was even silhouetted by a distant sun, which burned white, young, and beautifully.
“That’s not our star.” said Oya.

            <Title>Soldgi Erg</Title>
            <Text>The Great Soldgi Erg is a sea of sand that scours the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent, and people who grow up within sight of it grow up with the story of how those dunes came to be. Every time the story is told some details are added, some forgotten, and sometimes even the heart of it will change. The only thing that everyone agrees upon is that a god named Sol made those mountains of sand a long time ago, back when he walked the earth alone, and that is why it is called the Great Soldgi Erg. 
That’s was what was on Pyetle’s mind as he and the scribe Soreel lounged in his field, drinking his brew. When he asked Soreel if she believed the story about how the Erg was made, she could only scratch her head and ask, “Which story do you mean?” 
She gave a little half-sipped, absent sigh as she said it, the kind of sigh that you give when someone drunker-than-you starts to feel like they’re making sense of things. Soreel wanted to laze the day away in silence, wanted to drink Pyetle’s brew in silence, wanted to enjoy the cool Istil wind from the shade of a fat cedar tree in silence. She wanted to keep to her plan: waste time out in Pyetle’s field until the sun started to set, and then she would do what she came here to do.
She couldn’t drink too much because it was past midday and if she fell asleep she might not wake up until night. Already she could feel her head swirling and her eyelids slouching, intent on doing as little work as she was. The sun bearing down on the barren field all around wasn’t helping things. The glare was so bright that she could naught but squint, and that was near enough to having them closed that her buzzing brain had trouble marking the difference.
There wasn’t anything to look at either. Pyetle’s farm was twelve thousand square metres of wasteland. There was once a time when it boasted a harvest of legumes - soy, redbean and the like - but when salt started to show on the surface Pyetle was forced to plant barley. Nowadays the land was so salt-ridden that it looked like a sweat-stained shirt, and the only thing that would grow for miles around was the cedar tree under which they sat. The only thing that moved were the flies that buzzed around the ox’s ringed snout. Soreel distracted herself from sleep by watching them as the ox would snore and blow them out of his nose, and then they would fly back in to lick at the only source of moisture they could find amidst this desolation.
“I’m talking about the story that says it was all an accident,” Pyetle said. “That’s the story I like.”
Soreel stifled a groan and humored Pyetle by looking towards where he was pointing. There the distant southern horizon was rimmed by a hazy red blur of mounding sand; the Great Soldgi Erg.
“It’s the first story about Solraheen I can remember. I must have been about… I don’t know… four when I first heard it.”
“That would be why,” Soreel muttered.
“What’s that?”
“That’s why I haven’t heard it. If you heard it when you were four. That was a long time ago. By the time I got around to being me I bet that story had been forgotten.”
“No it hasn’t.”
“Clearly.”
Pyetle smiled. He had a gummy smile which cradled a few precious teeth. Soreel knew he wasn’t as old as he looked because he looked as old as the gnarled tree against which he sat. He was only fifty-two, but with how lined and leathered his skin was, how white his scraggled beard, he seemed seventy, or even eighty. His color was just like a Jandri slave’s - dark and dirty umber everywhere but the top of his bald olive head which had been spared from the sun by his straw hat.
Soreel hated how Pyetle was always smiling. He always smiled when he was drunk. He was a lively drunk. In fact the drunker he got the more intelligible he got because when he was sober he mumbled. There was always a point where he’d have too much and the spittle would start to run down his chin but he rarely ever got there. He was old and skinny but he could hold his drink.
He could feel Soreel looking at him. 
He asked her,“ Do you want to know how the story goes?”
 “No, not really.”
“Well the story goes that Sol wanted to build a garden to cover all the land.”
Soreel closed her eyes.
“Don’t interrupt me when I’m telling it,” Pyetle said.
Pyetle took another swig of his beer, and then he continued on.
“Solraheen planted a stick in the ground just south of here to mark one of the garden’s six corners.” Pyetle pointed towards the Soldgi Erg. “He then left to Sol-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. Well, that stake in the ground, that was the accident.”
Soreel looked and saw the Pyetle had a twig in his hand. He was poking it into hard, dry earth next to his hip.
“Sol planted that stake in the ground and then he left. Then in a few days a little…*hic*… a little embryo of a sand dune built up in that stick’s lee.”
Pyetle built up a little hump of dirt to the side of his own stick to demonstrate. Soreel wasn’t watching but Pyetle didn’t notice.
 “See it was all by accident. By accident Sol happened to put his stick in just the right spot, and it was left alone for just long enough, that the wind built that little hump of sand higher and higher. It grew wide and tall and in no time at all the first sand dune was born.”
At that he rubbed out his own little fledgling dune.
“By accident?” Soreel asked.
“An accident. Sure. Why not? You can’t tell me that Solraheen meant to turn good black earth into a mountain of sand. And that’s what happened. While Sol was off wandering in the middle of Sol-knows-where, shaping rivers, mountains, and fields and whatnot, that little dune got large enough to sustain itself. Large enough to not be blown away by the first squall or rainstorm. Then years passed and the Istil wind… or one of the winds stretched that dune south and east all the way to the southern tip of Corin.”
“What about all the other dunes?”
“Ah, see, that first dune grew tall, so tall that it rippled the wind and created a kind of nursery for neat little rows of dunes behind it. Those littler dunes would grow and grow. Soon they covered the land in all directions. And so them dunes over there came to be. The Great Soldgi Erg.”
“I don’t think that’s how it happened.”
“So you don’t believe it?”
“Hard to believe.”
“You could say it gets harder. Because we have to say that Solraheen not only made a mistake, but he gave up. See the earth over there was once spongy and black. It was good earth. Not like this salty shit that I’ve got. Then the good lord stuck his stick in the ground and then - boom - sand. Cleaning it all up was such a task that He just up and left. Decided not to do it. He gave up.”
“That’s not what happened.”
“Oh? Were you there?”
“Solraheen knows the winds. He knows the appetite of the sand. He made them. Everyone knows that he pulled the Erg up from the earth. The Soldgi Erg is the garden.”
Pyetle spat a little spittle onto the ground. The earth was so dry and caked by the sun, as hard as fired clay, that the spit just lingered there on the surface. 
“You sound just like one of Sol’s itinerants,” he said. He then stood up and assumed a pose in mock imitation of those traveling preachers. He kept his chin up, kept his back stiff as a board, and then stretched his hand out to the heavens. He began to preach in kind, voice inflected with grandeur as if addressing an unbeliever.
“See how Solraheen’s golden light shimmers across Sand. A sweet smelling rose or a pink-petaled poppy would only blemish such beauty.”</Text>

Two gallons is a great deal of wine, even for two paisanos. Spiritually the jugs may be graduated thus: just below the shoulder of the first bottle, serious and concentrated conversation. Two inches farther down, sweetly sad memory. Three inches more, thoughts of old and satisfactory loves. An inch, thoughts of old and bitter loves. Bottom of the first jug, general and undirected sadness. Shoulder of the second jug, black, unholy despondency. Two fingers down, a song of death or longing. A thumb, every other song each one knows. The graduation stops here, for the trail splits and there is no certainty. From this point on, anything can happen.

intimate perfume of femininity and gives the finest sense of the charm of a cluster of girls, the sweet sense of their chatter, and the contact of their bodies, that is to be found before Shakespeare, because that mocking gaiety we call Aristophanies reaches here its most positive acclamation of life, vitalizing sex with a deep delight, a rare happiness of the spirit. 

De Bello Gallica

wandered more from the truth 

Great as Caesar was by the benefit of his original nature, there can be no doubt that he, like others, owed something to circumstances; and perhaps amongst those which were most favourable to the premature development of great self-dependence we must reckon the early death of his father. It is, or it is not, according to the nature of men, an advantage to be orphaned at as early age. Perhaps utter orphanage is rarely or never such: but to lose a father betimes may, under appropriate circumstances, profit a strong mind greatly. To Caesar it was a prodigious benefit that he lost his father when not much more than fifteen. Perhaps it was an advantage also to his father that he died thus early. Had he stayed a year longer, he might have seen himself despised, baffled, and made ridiculous. For where, let us ask, in any age, was the father capable of adequately sustaining that relation to the unique Caius Julius—to him, in the appropriate language of Shakespeare
&quot;The foremost man of all this world?&quot;

And at another he was accustomed to amuse himself with computing how much money it would require to make him worth exactly nothing (i.e. simply to clear him of debts); this, by one account, amounted to upwards of two millions sterling. Now, the error of historians has been to represent these debts as the original ground of his ambition and his revolutionary projects, as though the desperate condition of his private affairs had suggested a civil war to his calculations as the best or only mode of redressing it. 

Caesar's debts, far from being stimulants and exciting causes of his political ambition, stood in an inverse relation to the ambition; they were its results, and represented its natural costs, being contracted from first to last in the service of his political intrigues, for raising and maintaining a powerful body of partisans, both in Rome and elsewhere. Whosoever indeed will take the trouble to investigate the progress of Caesar's ambition, from such materials as even yet remain, may satisfy himself that the scheme of revolutionizing the Republic, and placing himself at its head, was no growth of accident or circumstances; above all, that it did not arise upon any so petty and indirect a suggestion as that of his debts; but that his debts were in their very first origin purely ministerial to his wise, indispensable, and patriotic ambition; and that his revolutionary plans were at all periods of his life a direct and foremost object, but in no case bottomed upon casual impulses. In this there was not only patriotism, but in fact the one sole mode of patriotism which could have prospered, or could have found a field of action. 

Chatter not, sublime reader, commonplaces of scoundrel moralists against ambition. In some cases ambition is a hopeful virtue; in others (as in the Rome of our resplendent Julius) ambition was the virtue by which any other could flourish. It had become evident to everybody that Rome, under its present constitution, must fall; and the sole question was—by whom? Even Pompey, not by nature of an aspiring turn, and prompted to his ambitious course undoubtedly by circumstances and, the friends who besieged him, was in the habit of saying, &quot;Sylla potuit: ego non potero?&quot; Sylla found it possible: shall I find it not so? Possible to do what? To overthrow the political system of the Republic. This had silently collapsed into an order of things so vicious, growing also so hopelessly worse, that all honest patriots invoked a purifying revolution, even though bought at the heavy price of a tyranny, rather than face the chaos of murderous distractions to which the tide of feuds and frenzies was violently tending. 

sedulously attentive to elegance of personal appearance 

So refined were his habits, and so constant his demand for the luxurious accommodations of polished life as it then existed in Rome, that he is said to have carried with him, as indispensable parts of his personal baggage, the little ivory lozenges, squares and circles or ovals, with other costly materials, wanted for the tessellated flooring of his tent. Habits such as these will easily account for his travelling in a carriage rather than on horseback. 

The courtesy and obliging disposition of Caesar were notorious; and both were illustrated in some anecdotes which survived for generations in Rome. Dining on one occasion, as an invited guest, at a table where the servants had inadvertently, for salad-oil, furnished some sort of coarse lamp-oil, Caesar would not allow the rest of the company to point out the mistake to their host, for fear of shocking him too much by exposing what might have been construed into inhospitality. At another time, whilst halting at a little cabaret, when one of his retinue was suddenly taken ill, Caesar resigned to his use the sole bed which the house afforded. Incidents as trifling as these express the urbanity of Caesar's nature; and hence one is the more surprised to find the alienation of the Senate charged, in no trifling degree, upon a gross and most culpable failure in point of courtesy. Caesar, it is alleged— but might we presume to call upon antiquity for its authority?— neglected to rise from his seat, on their approaching him with an address of congratulation. It is said, and we can believe it, that he gave deeper offence by this one defect in a matter of ceremonial observance than by all his substantial attacks upon their privileges. What we find it difficult to believe is not that result from that offence—this is no more than we should all anticipate—not that, but the possibility of the offence itself, from one so little arrogant as Caesar, and so entirely a man of the world. He was told of the disgust which he had given; and we are bound to believe his apology, in which he charged it upon sickness, that would not at the moment allow him to maintain a standing attitude. Certainly the whole tenor of his life was not courteous only, but kind, and to his enemies merciful in a degree which implied so much more magnanimity than men in general could understand that by many it was put down to the account of weakness. 

A forum which Caesar built out of the products of his last campaign, by way of a present to the Roman people, cost him—for the ground merely on which it stood— nearly eight hundred thousand pounds. To the citizens of Rome he presented, in one congiary, about two guineas and a half a head. To his army, in one donation, upon the termination of the Civil War, he gave a sum which allowed about two hundred pounds a man to the infantry, and four hundred to the cavalry. It is true that the legionary troops were then much reduced by the sword of the enemy, and by the tremendous hardships of their last campaigns. In this, however, he did perhaps no more than repay a debt. For it is an instance of military attachment, beyond all that Wallenstein or any commander, the most beloved amongst his troops, has ever experienced, that, on the breaking out of the Civil War, not only did the centurions of every legion severally maintain a horse soldier, but even the privates volunteered to serve without pay, and (what might seem impossible) without their daily rations. This was accomplished by subscriptions amongst themselves, the more opulent undertaking for the maintenance of the needy. Their disinterested love for Caesar appeared in another and more difficult illustration: it was a traditionary anecdote in Rome that the majority of those amongst Caesar's troops who had the misfortune to fall into the enemy's hands refused to accept their lives under the condition of serving against him. 

COnfessions of an english opium eater - Thomas De Quincy

“and a ripe and a good one,” and of all my tutors was the only one whom I loved or reverenced. Unfortunately for me (and, as I afterwards learned, to this worthy man’s great indignation), I was transferred to the care, first of a blockhead, who was in a perpetual panic lest I should expose his ignorance; and finally to that of a respectable scholar at the head of a great school on an ancient foundation. This man had been appointed to his situation by —— College, Oxford, and was a sound, well-built scholar, but (like most men whom I have known from that college) coarse, clumsy, and inelegant. A miserable contrast he presented, in my eyes, to the Etonian brilliancy of my favourite master; and beside, he could not disguise from my hourly notice the poverty and meagreness of his understanding. It is a bad thing for a boy to be and to know himself far beyond his tutors, whether in knowledge or in power of mind. This was the case, so far as regarded knowledge at least, not with myself only, for the two boys, who jointly with myself composed the first form, were better Grecians than the head-master, though not more elegant scholars, nor at all more accustomed to sacrifice to the Graces.  

On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts

and fought wonderfully, considering that he was
drenched in perspiration; but the shine was now taken out of him, and his
game was the mere effect of panic. It was now clear that he could not last
much longer. In the course of this round we tried the weaving system, in
which I had greatly the advantage, and hit him repeatedly on the conk.
My reason for this was, that his conk was covered with carbuncles; and I
thought I should vex him by taking such liberties with his conk, which in
fact I did.

&quot;The three next rounds, the master of the rolls staggered about like a cow
on the ice. Seeing how matters stood, in round twenty-fourth I whispered
something into his ear, which sent him down like a shot. It was nothing
more than my private opinion of the value of his throat at an annuity
office. This little confidential whisper affected him greatly; the very
perspiration was frozen on his face, and for the next two rounds I had it
all my own way. And when I called _time_ for the twenty-seventh round, he
lay like a log on the floor.&quot;

Chopper
I chop things
Beautiful earrior. Was put on this earth to chop.



“Why did you bring me back from the dead?”
“You’ll have to ask Ayram that. Or maybe Elrahet. Usually we bring people back to bolster the ranks. But you, your dead body was a most auspicious discovery. Some of us Ayramun think it was an ill omen finding you already dead in our soon-to-be ambush.Whispers of demon and Shis and whatnot.”
“Is that what you think I am, an ill omen?”
“It doesn’t matter what I think. What matters is what you were doing in that ravine, so spit it out.”
“I’m from Meskalam. I left and wandered into the Junei because I heard it was beautiful.”
“Beautiful? The Junei plain? It has a certain charm to it but its not worth risking your life over.”
“Well I wanted to see it before I died.”
“Could have waited till you were a little more prepared.”
“No, I really couldn’t.”
“Why not?” moto’s mind starts to turn. Why would a young man not have time to wait to see something?
“Wait, you don’t have some disease, do you?”
“No.”
“Is someone after you, then?”
“No, nothing like that.”


 unlike the highways which keep to the river banks or hop between oases, these roads cut through the vast expanses of the Sand, and that means exposure to the sun, the wind, and the heat - it is certain death if a pilgrim goes unprepared. The longer the road the deadlier it all is, though that’s only a rule of thumb because the worst Charnel Road, the Bazul Road, is one of the shortest. It sits just north of the Uncharted Portion and it runs up and over the crest of a low-lying range of hills. An eon of blasting sand had reduced those once proud mountains to a dump of gravel, and it does much the same to pilgrims who dare to make the scramble.
It only takes a full day to make the Bazul Road if you start at the nearest Hrkan outpost at Shahiz, but the Bazul road is a shadeless world of chalky gravel, white as bone, so the sunlight doesn’t disappear into the ground, it gets thrown right back up into the face. A pilgrim can’t even hide in her own shadow. She gets baked from below as much as from above.


“

Transition to Pyetle waking up to being dragged along in a makeshift sled on a charnel road?
Convo with Mandrameen.
There’s a smaller skinny dude who is dumb as fuck. Mazyd.

Absolute huge-ass brute.
Moteah is like, nope don’t talk about it.
“But I got to know”
“Between you and Ayram.”
“I had visions.”
“We all did.”
“Does everyone see the same thing?”
“Don’t think so. But it’s not something we talk about.”
“The one thing that’s the same is that everyone feels differet. You get urges to do things you wouldn’t normally do. Maybe its confidence.”


Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
 “The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Rghiz is a long way off.

“Yeah.”
 “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.” 


Everyone stops. Half splitting off.
Don’t like stopping but ok.
Mazyd needs to stop. Pyetle too - put bandage on feet to prevent blisters.

About half the crew setting off in different direction. All the Ferzans + some others. 
“They aren’t coming. There’s too many Kackle trees over there.”
“What’s wrong with Kackle trees?”
“They’re shade-givers. They’re afraid them.”
“Ferzans are afraid of shade?”
“They love shade. It’s the trees they’re afraid of. They think the trees spread out like that and give so much shade to lure desperate creatures in. They think the trees release a poison into the air that kills whatever’s sitting under it.”
“Do they? I’ve sat under Kackle trees all my life.”
“No, they don’t. I can’t prove it, but, they don’t. But most Ferzans think the trees are trying to kill them. They think the roots feast on the bones once they’ve sunk into the earth.”
“That can’t be right.”
“It’s part of their whole deal. I’m not too sure to be honest. Hard to get it out of them. But they won’t go near Kackle trees.”
“It doesn’t make sense. Trees aren’t even living things.”
“Of course they are. They move. Living things are things that move. They don’t move move, but they grow. That’s a kind of movement.”
“Movement isn’t what makes a thing alive. Rocks move.”
“I’m not talking about falling, or rolling down hill. Trees move on their own. They’re trying to do things. Shows they have souls.”
“I’m not talking about falling either. Have you ever been to the Sassa salt plain? The ground there is flat as can be for miles. There’s no rain. Dry as can be. No? Well I’ve walked across it, right across the middle of it. There’s rocks there, some small, some about a meter long, and sure, when you walk by them they’re still as can be, but they’ve got trails running behind them through the salt. They’re moving. Slowly, imperceptibly, maybe decades to move an inch, but they’re moving.”
“You’re lying.”
“I’m not lying. Rocks move. You haven’t heard of Sassa?”
Mandrameen shook his head.
“Well it’s there. The Sassa salt plain. About forty leagues west of Chunran. You should go and see it before you get all assured in your narrow definition of Life. I’m telling you, listen to an old man, it’s not as simple as movement.”
“What is it then?”
“It’s children. Living things have children. If a thing has a child, then it’s alive. If it doesn’t, it’s not.”
“That doesn’t make sense. You said that trees aren’t alive, but trees have children.”
“They don’t.”
“You sure about that?”
“Well, no, but… well it seems to me that trees, plants, they just make copies of themselves. It’s a static kind of thing. There’s no life.”
“That just seems absurd.”
“Why’s that?”
“Look… I don’t know. I don’t really think about this kind of stuff.”
“I’m telling you, it’s the children. Sex is part of it. If the things have sex, they’re alive.”
“It’s not the sex, it’s the killing,” Mazyd interjected.
They look at Mazyd like, wtf bro.
“If you call it life,” Mazyd continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. You can crush a rock with a hammer and you can crush a bug with your thumb, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. That the cost of maintaining a soul - it’s the killing and then the eating.” That last word rolled through Mazyd’s beard like a saw.
“I hadn’t thought about that aspect of it,” Pyetle said.
“Makes sense from a Ferzan point of view. Trees are alive, so they’ve got to be killing something, no?”
“Yes,” Mazyd said, “Maybe all trees are killing us, slowly. Maybe that’s why we age. They’re releasing invisible poison into the air and we’re breathing it, right now we’re breathing it, and its making us age. We age, we die, we’re buried in the earth, and that’s when they feast on our bones. Maybe if it weren’t for trees we would be immortal.”
“What do you mean, ‘we’. You’re not human. You know, I know what you’re doing. I don’t like you. I’m not a barbarian so I’m not going to rough you up for the sake of it, but if I was, I would. So don’t talk.”
“Maybe he’s right,” Pyetle said. “There are stories of desert hermits, holy folk, living for hundreds of years.”
Bullo scrunched up his cheeks and said, “Now that is not true.”
“You seem certain,” Mazyd said. “But how can you be sure?”
Bullo looked at Mazyd with a fire. “What did I just say?”
“You said not to talk,” Mazyd answered, “but you also said you wouldn’t rough me up. You neutered your command as soon as you gave it.”
“Do you want me to hit you?” Bullo asked.
Mazyd’s diminutive form.
Mazyd looked at him and said, simply, “No.”
“But you understand that I have to hit you now, right?”
“You’ll do what you want. But there’d be no point. We Seilsi do not feel pain if we don’t want to.”
“So if I were to break your ribs, you wouldn’t be able to feel it?”
“I’d feel it. Though it wouldn’t be painful.”
“Well now I have to punch you.” Bullo, eager to test it out. 
Bullo punches him the side. 
Little effect.
“Seilsi don’t lie,” Mandri said.
“Hold on. I didn’t hear a crack.”
Bullo punches again. Clear, loud crack.
Instead of doubling over in pain. Sharp exhale, seemed to knock the wind out of him, but little else.
Bullo is like, wtf.
“I’m curious to see what you’ll do next, Seargent,” Mazyd said. “Seems the long years of thinking with your fists has cowed you. All you need to do is promise me some small pleasure in exchange for cooperation. Incentivize good behavior. Did the comissars not teach you this when you came up the ranks?”
“Pleasure? I’m not giving you anything.”
“Is there anything you want me to give you?”
“I want you to shut up.”
“Sargent -”
“Don’t fucking call me sargent.”
“Sargent Bullo, bigger things than your peace of mind are stake. I know all the strategies, logistics, and capabilities of the Imperial machine. Don’t you want that information from me? Doesn’t Ayram?”
“You’ll tell me how you plan to find the Jandri?”
“Nothing is off the table.”
“So what, I give you freedom, and you tell Ayram everything he wants to know? Actually that brings something to mind - why aren’t you having this conversation with Ayram? I’m just a foot soldier. I can’t give you anything even if you wanted it.”
“The reason I’m having this conversation with you, not Ayram, is because there is something you can give me.”
“And what is that?”
“Your protection.”
“Is that so?”
“Protection from anything or anyone that tries to kill me out here. For now, that means protection from the rest of the Ayramun. I know you’re not a barbarian, but the lot of them are. In fact I’ve heard how they plan to murder me before we reach Jughgar.”
“Who threatened you?”
“Well, they didn’t know I was listening. I am not human. I can hear better than -”
“It doesn’t matter,” Mandri interjected. “I’m sure they were just… expressing themselves. Ayram has said what he wants to do with you. He won’t allow them to kill you.”
“I don’t think they intend to get your leaders permission,” Mazyd said. “In fact, one of them said, 'I hate the bastard more than I fear Ayram’. That sentiment seemed to steel their nerves together. By all appearances, they intend to go through with it.”
“They said the feared Ayram?”
“They did.”
“I don’t believe you.”
Mazyd description. Huge and grand in the eyes despite the pitiful body. “Sargent, you know that one of the many reasons why we Seilsi do not lie is because it helps us treat with our enemies. We can get somewhere in negotiations if they know we’re telling the truth. I’m not saying you have to trust me. I won’t insult your intelligence. But you can trust what we say as sure as you can trust the sand in the Hollow to blow east.”
Bullo tenses up.
“Well if an Ayramun is plotting against Ayram, then that’s something I would want to know. It’s not Mandri here, is it?”
“Do we have an agreement?”
“If an Ayramun wants to kill you, there’s not much I’m going to be able to do about it.”
“If these were men were like you, Sargent, men of resolve, then I would agree. But these are men of opportunity. Simple countermeasures should suffice.”
“We Ayramun lack many things, but one thing we’ve got buckets of is conviction. Really, that’s all we’ve got.”
“I’m not so sure about that. Irregardless, you are my best option for protecting myself. I can’t exactly ask them for forgiveness for whatever they think I’ve done to them.”
“What they think you’ve done to them? You don’t have any idea?”
“I’m sure I do.”
“You feel no guilt?”
“Virtue without terror is impotent, Sargent. Do you not agree?”
Expected equivication, shifting of blame. 
“Why do you think I’m out here? Sick dicks like you running things in the empire.”
“I don’t expect you to like me, Sargent. I do expect you’ll fill your end of the bargain.”
“I’ll talk to Ayram.”
“Keep our agreement between us. ”
“I keep nothing from Ayram.”
“I would feel better about our relationship if you didn’t - and that’s ultimately your goal here, no? The game within the game. It’s not about getting what you want from me, it’s about developing a working relationship, because only then you’ll get what you want from me.”
“What about Pyetle?”
“I trust Pyetle.”
Bullo gives odd look, but then, like whatever.
“Well Pyetle, go run off and help someone do something.”
Pyetle didn’t need to go and do anything. Mandri led Pyetle up to the front of the column, where Ayram walked. Ayram carring Pella on his back like swaddling babe.
Pyetle followed along behind. 
Sun setting. 
Far away, the minting rock.

“Life? Everything is alive, because everything is connected. Everything is the same thing. Think about it. Just because you can think about something as being by itself, in a void, dosn’t mean you should. We’re here, sitting here, but we’re together, we’re sitting on the ground. We require this food, this earth, and earth requires us. Look at what we’ve done to it. It’s all the same thing. Nothing exist in a void. It all exists together. Thinking any other way, and your just playing with yourself. Like the barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? Pointless to think about. It’s just a word game.”

“What you on about?” Seb asked.

“You ever seen a demon before?” Seb asked, dismissively.
“It was demon. It was a… a…”. Mandri couldn’t finish the sentence because he didn’t know what it was that he’d seen. He could paint it’s spitting image if asked, but a head and a horn does not make. It wasn’t human, that much he knew, but it wasn’t anything else.
Ayram pushed his way back through through group, and he leered down at Mandrameen as he gave his beard a serious tug.
“What was it you saw?”
“It was a demon.”
“I didn’t ask what you thought you saw, what did you see.”
Mandri floundered around for a word that could. The pressure of Ayram’s glare pushed out a . “I saw a… a face… a face, a beastman’s face with a horn sticking out like this…” Mandri traced the shape of a horn growing out of his forehead, sticking out at an odd angle and curling down.
Ayram gave his beard a four-fingered flourish as he gazed up at the rocky slope. 
Ayram’s questing eye glanced back down at Mandri.
“There are horned lizards.”
Elrahet walked over to . This was the closest Mandri’d ever been to this old woman. THere’s closes , the smell of a person, here . The eyes, half-clouded, wondered if she could even see.</Text>

	Seb waved a hand over Mandri’s sightless eyes. The boy was catatonic, his limbs limp on the cold stone floor. Seb leaned over Mandri’s face, he could see Mandri’s pupils flicker as the boy fell deeper and deeper into the trance of the God’s Eye burgeon. 
	What sights was the boy seeing?Seb had taken God’s Eye several times before, but every time he emerged from that sacred stupor, he could not recall precisely what had he had seen. There was only the sense that his soul had blossomed and then burst into of euphoria. That sense of having brushed up against omniscience.


Nothing. So hard to not think this is something. Expecatations and whatnot.
The voice of Pell.

My lady.
You’ve brought someone?
He’s brought Mandrameen. Heard your servant Salavan.
Mmmmm interesting. Well now, this is a development.
Touches Mandri’s corpse.

I found him myself. I was- 
I don’t care how it happened, only that it did. Though, I suppose if he were to come alive, that it would be Elrahet to do it.

Interesting.


The other issue.

That will be a close run thing.

If Ayram were delayed by a day or two, that would give…
After the storm, He’s going to want to have to head towards the skelti sand. Direct him towards shulik.

But I dont understand, if their goal is to kill solraheen, why are we trying to stop them?
Isn’t that want we want? Solraheen dies, and Schisol rises from the ashes? 

Schisol is *inside* of Solraheen.
They are not trying kill solraheen. They are trying to end him. They want to completely destroy the body. If there is no more body, the Solraheen can’t be killed, and Schisol cannot rise from the flesh.


HUGE ass lizard. 
End on her coaxing it onto it’s belly, then slicing the stomach open.

Parataxis
	- tell me, how are you?
The underlying idea is that in a connected discourse, complete independence among the consecutive sentences is very rare. This observation is captured in the expression &quot;train of thought&quot;.[5] Consider the following:
The sun was shining brightly. We went for a walk.
The sun was shining brightly; we went for a walk.
The sun was shining brightly, and we went for a walk.
The sun was shining brightly, so we went for a walk.
In the first example, the two sentences are independent expressions, while in the last example they are dependent. However, the connection of thought in the first examples is just as real as in the last ones, where it is explicitly expressed via the syntax of subordination.
In spoken language, this continuance from sentence to sentence is supported by intonation and timing (rhythm, pause). While details may differ among different languages and cultures, generally similar musicality and shortness of pauses indicate the continuation, while the change of tone and longer pause generally indicate the transition to another connected group of ideas.
In storytelling, storytellers utilize paratactic or syntactic styles. Parataxis is common among oral storytellers. When telling a story orally, there are many inconsistencies because of the lack of a written-down, word-for-word, multiply-checked draft. However, audiences do not set out to compare the stories word for word and are only interested in the main points of the story.[7]

Parataxis roughly translates to &quot;arranging side by side&quot;, while hypotaxis translates to &quot;arranging under&quot;. Parataxis omits subordinating conjunctions while hypotaxis utilizes them such as the terms &quot;when&quot;, &quot;although&quot;, and &quot;after&quot;. Parataxis juxtaposes ideas and thoughts, while hypotaxis subordinates ideas to one another and can show both juxtaposition and transition. Because of this, hypotaxis can show relationships of cause and effect, chronology, and comparison 


Hypotaxis is the grammatical arrangement of functionally similar but &quot;unequal&quot; constructs (from Greek hypo- &quot;beneath&quot;, and taxis &quot;arrangement&quot;); certain constructs have more importance than others inside a sentence.
A common example of syntactic expression of hypotaxis is the subordination of one syntactic unit to another in a complex sentence.[1] Another example is observed in premodification. In the phrase &quot;inexpensive composite materials&quot;, &quot;composite&quot; modifies &quot;materials&quot; while &quot;inexpensive&quot; modifies the complex head &quot;composite materials&quot;, rather than &quot;composite&quot; or &quot;materials&quot;. In this example the phrase units are hierarchically structured, rather than being on the same level, as compared to the example &quot;Cockroaches love warm, damp, dark places.&quot; Note the syntactic difference; hypotactic modifiers cannot be separated by a comma.

Anagnorisis (/ˌænəɡˈnɒrɪsɪs/; Ancient Greek: ἀναγνώρισις) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the hero's sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy. 

 Lear, driven out by his older daughters and rescued by his youngest, realizes their true characters. 
The earliest use of anagnorisis in a murder mystery was in &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, a classical Arabian Nights tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its twist ending.[4] The protagonist of the story, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is ordered by Harun al-Rashid to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along 



Amplification (rhetoric)
Amplification refers to a literary practice wherein the writer embellishes the sentence by adding more information to it in order to increase its worth and understanding.
E.g., Original sentence: The thesis paper was difficult. After amplification: The thesis paper was difficult: it required extensive research, data collection, sample surveys, interviews and a lot of fieldwork.




Asyndeton
When sentences do not use conjunctions (e.g., and, or, nor) to separate clauses, but run clauses into one another, usually marking the separation of clauses with punctuation.
An example is when John F. Kennedy said on January 20, 1961 &quot;...that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.&quot;




Bathos
An abrupt transition in style from the exalted to the commonplace, producing a ludicrous effect. While often unintended, bathos may be used deliberately to produce a humorous effect.[7][8]
The ballerina rose gracefully en pointe and extended one slender leg behind her, like a dog at a fire hydrant.[9]




Dramatic visualization
Representing an object or character with abundant descriptive detail, or mimetically rendering gestures and dialogue to make a scene more visual or imaginatively present to an audience.
This technique appears at least as far back as the Arabian Nights.[11]
Euphuism
An artificial, highly elaborate way of writing or speaking. Named from Euphues (1579) the prose romance by John Lyly.
&quot;Is it not far better to abhor sins by the remembrance of others' faults, than by repentance of thine own follies?&quot; (from Euphues, 1, lecture by the wise Neapolitan)



Leitwortstil
Purposefully repeating words that usually express a motif or theme important to the story.
This dates back at least to the Arabian Nights.[13]



Metonymy
Word or phrase in a figure of speech in which a noun is referenced by something closely associated with it, rather than explicitly by the noun itself. This is not to be confused with synecdoche, in which a part of the whole stands for the thing itself.
Metonomy: The boxer threw in the towel. Synecdoche: She gave her hand in marriage.




Onomatopoeia
Words that imitate/spell a sound or noise.
Word that sounds the same as, or similar to what the word means.
&quot;Boom goes the dynamite.&quot; &quot;Bang!&quot; &quot;Bark.&quot; (comic books)



Polysyndeton
Polysyndeton is the use of several conjunctions in close succession, this provides a sense of exaggeration designed to wear down the audience.
An example of this is in the first chapter of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens: &quot;A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin&quot;

            <Text>When humanity was young and most people were living in dens like lizards, the people who called themselves the Solgruin were building civilization. They built the first canals and the first sustenance fields; a grid of plots measuring 6 by 1, clean and even rectangles set just off the banks of the Solket river, mapped out by the first cadastral texts. They had the first plow oxen, the first harvests, and the first age of plenty, all followed by the first catastrophic drought, the first stretch of worn out land, and the first law of fallow. This was all long, long before rest of Old Jandri toddled to its feet, and it was a time that history would have forgot if not for the fact that when the Solgruin capital burned to the ground, the fires baked the scribal clay as hard as rocks and crumbling ruins kept them buried safe for centuries. One of the stories that survived was the story of the creation of the Goree Pass.
One day, Solgruin petitioners went to the temple of Solraheen, and outside the veil of His bedchamber, they sang their complaint to Him in structured verse - as it was proper etiquette to address the Creator with song, even if all you were doing was complaining about how the Goree mountains were too difficult to traverse. The Solgruin were set on the western side of the Goree, and eastern Jandri wasn’t far away by land, yet because of the Goree’s impenetrable physique, the only way to get there was by boat, a five day journey around the southern horn, and the ferrymen charged extortionate prices. The song ended by requesting, humbly, that Solraheen should part the mountains.
When Solraheen asked why they would want to go to eastern Jandri, the Solgruin said that they wanted to spread Your word to our kin. The truth was that they’d heard rumors of gold laying on the ground in eastern Jandri. Naturally, Solraheen saw through their pretensions and denied their request.
A few hundred years later, the Solgruin forgot that Solraheen refused their forebears, and they went to Him a second time to ask, humbly, if He might part the mountains. This generation was more honest in their request, as they made clear their desires were mundane; they wanted to walk their caravans into eastern Jandri, that they might trade with the budding cities of Jeket and Shagota.
Again, Solraheen denied them.
Time passed, the Solket river dwindled, the city’s temple began to fail, and again, a new generation rose up and went before Solraheen and asked if He might part the mountains.
This third time, Solraheen answered with action. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak one day north of the city, and there he stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Yet the Solgruin did not rejoice, for when Solraheen showed them what he’d done, He said to the them, “Look upon this scar which mars My creation and lament your insolence. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, it’s beauty gone. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
This story is taught in every Solitant school throughout the Hrkan world because its lesson is not obvious, and the process of discovering that lesson is meant to be a stepping stone to prepare students for some of the more unintuitive theologies, for if one operates solely on common sense and surface understandings, they’ll arrive at the wrong conclusion. It would seem that the story of the Goree Pass is one which highlights humanity’s self-centered hubris; Solraheen created the earth and all its beauty, and then humanity comes along, and in its presumptuous way, said to its Creator, “What you’ve made is great, but you know it really would be a lot better if we could just make a few changes.”
That’s how Mandrameen understood the story - it’s a warning to never put your own desires above Solraheen’s, else you might be cursed. 
But he was told that understanding was wrong.
Why?
Because his Solitant proctor said so.
The old man tried to explain that young Mandri was making a category error, that there is no difference between our desires and Solraheen’s, but Mandrameen wouldn’t have it. Even at the tender age of ten, he’d heard it all before.
“Our desires are Solraheen’s desires, for we are His tools, and a tool is an expression of purpose.”
“Humanity is His tool, one that He uses to shape creation.”
“As the desires of the wind shapes the dunes, and the desires of the water shapes the valleys, so too do the desires of humanity shape the rock and clay.”
Virtuous desires, corrupting desires… Humanity is reduced to an impersonal force, more in common with the wind and rain than the mind of Solraheen.
“We are the painting, not the painter. We are the subject, not the audience.”
And if we are not the intended audience, then it necessarily follows that there is no lesson for us in the story of the Goree pass, or in any story in particular. And if all we are is an animated drama with profound aesthetic appeal, then the Goree Pass is not an ‘ugly’ rent in the mountain range, it is an act in a play, one with a depth of meaning that transcends the capacity for human reason.
This is all a little bit much to lay on a gaggle of ten year olds. It begs the question, one which a precocious ten-year old might ask, “If stories aren’t meant for us, then why do we listen to and tell them?”
To this, Solitants smirk and say, “Very good, you’re on the right track,” and then they refuse to explicate, the only nod with a promising smile that suggests that the student is on the cusp of righteousness.
Mandrameen liked the story of the Goree Pass. There was something in it for him. It justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.
Mandri had spent a week and a small fortune on this painting, and he scrapped it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the King of the Huldolun, and the woman wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Puddles!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Puddles!”.
Now, Mandri could have tried find a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment, and as his fingers tore the canvas, a sense of justice motivated through his veins, and he tore it completely in half, right there in front of that woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came confused anger. Her voiced pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, he would have cursed that woman, just as Solraheen cursed those who journey the Goree Pass.
But even curses do little to dissuade people from defying their own desires. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.
According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.
Either there was no curse and the story was just a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin.
Moto gestured grandly to the bright morning sky and asked, “How could such a place be cursed?”
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To Mandri’s right was the open desert, and to his left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Namid from spreading out of control. 
Marching southward, came the first signs of Solraheen’s spite, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven as rocks popped up out of the sand like roots, and the further south they went, the Goree’s wall grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground, and these cracks had long been rubbed smooth by an eon of blasting sand, rounding the edges, pillowing the seams, giving the them the appearance of infected, pustuled scars. 
Mandri could see the Goree Pass in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Moto informed Mandri that that splinter was a tower, a central column in a fortification which spanned the length of the pass, protecting the entrance in ancient times from ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage with all the boulders scattered about. Scrambling over those which were mostly buried. Some were the size of Minting Rock.
“This is what rock vomit looks like,” said Seb. He was walking alongside Mandri and Obo, gums squelching on a Borcandi spine. “Solraheen punched the gut of the mountain, and the mountain spat these big rocks out. Can you believe it? Like kidney stones.”
Obo, bouncing along in his litter, “You have a peculiar talent for transforming the ineffable into the disgusting,” he said.
Mandri agreed that the scattered boulders were a disquieting sight, for the amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. Would have been unbelievable if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it.
Mandrameen imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant speck outshining the sun, his golden rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe for Him to set the fount of creation under the earth to bubbling, the mountains to quaking, and then the earth’s crust would burst open, and exploding out, miles up into the air, were stones the size of houses. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and spat out - vomited out - onto the desert plain. 
The boulders dwarfed Mandrameen, and he supposed he wasn’t the only one feeling small, for Seb’s back seemed stuck in an almost reverential bow. That bend could be attributed to the weight of Seb’s pack and the long journey bearing on him, but the man’s face was alight in anxious wonder as his eyes fretted about and his jaw chewed his borcandi spines so hard that his muscles were going stiff. And the man wasn’t paying attention to where he was spitting the juice. Halfway up and over a light scramble over a low shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel. This precipitated a conflict.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted himself up onto. The two shared a long, sizing look. “Don’t disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Oh? Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a man like that, it’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my leg!”
“It was an accident!”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to .”
This a standoff.


Mandri brushed past them, and then Purl. Purl said, “This is how it gets when a fight is coming.”
“We’re expecting to get into a fight?” Mandri asked.
Purl scoffed. “What do you think we’ve come all this way for?”
“Running from the Hrks,” Mandri said.
“We’re not running from them, we’re luring them into a trap.”
“Is that what we’re doing?” Obo asked, his sarcastic.
Purl huffed and said, “Once we meet up with the Greskalun, we’re going to trap the Hrks in the Goree Pass and capture their Riga, and once that’s done, you will no longer be a problem.”
Mandri asked, “That’s all happening today?”
Purl shrugged. “Probably,” she said.
“But we’ve just crawled out of the most forsaken place on earth.”
“That doesn’t matter,” Purl said. “If the Hrks are on us, it’ll be today.”
Mandri asked Obo. “What do you think, Obo? Are the Hrks right on our tail?”
Obo was quick to answer, like he’d been waiting for Mandri to ask. “I can’t be sure,” he said.
Purl grunted. “What would he know about it?”
“He doesn’t know about it, that’s why he said he can’t be sure.”
“He acts like he does know, that’s the thing.”
Obo quipped, “I don’t.”
Purl reluctantly set her eyes upon Obo. 
“Then stop acting like you do.”
“What’s he doing?” Mandri asked?
Purl’s lip curled in disgust. “He’s got that sickly smile plastered on his face,” she said.
“That’s just how he looks.”
Purl grunted as if she didn’t agree. She to fix Obo.
“These could be your final hours, creature.”
“They could be yours as well,” Obo countered.
“You’re not getting it. If the Hrks do show up today, then regardless of who wins, you’re as good as dead.”
Obo nestled into his pack. “If that’s true, then I suppose I shouldn’t be smiling.”
“It is true.”
“So you say.”
“See, that’s exactly it - you act like you know something I don’t… and maybe you do, but I know things you don’t know too, and if you were smart you’d take that into account before getting all smugly.”
“Purl, I don’t doubt that you have some unique experiences or information that I don’t, but what you don’t have - and this isn’t an insult, I’m simply being honest here - what you don’t have is insight. You don’t have understanding.”
“Uh-huh”.
“That’s nothing to be ashamed of. No one criticizes a rock for it’s capacity for reason. A rock is a rock and that’s fine. It’s the same for humans such as yourself and Mandrameen.”
“Oh, so we’re rocks compared to you?”
“Again, I’m not insulting you. Human beings in general. Oh, don’t act like you don’t agree. I’ve seen the way you look at people. Any time someone says something ridiculous, I see those eyes go dead - see that’s it! That’s exactly it, that furrowed brow.”
“Evidently your missing the way I’m looking at you.”
“My are simply confusing your reflexive impulses. Someone says something you don’t agree with, and you look at them like they’re stupid, only in my case, the fact that you don’t agree with me is your fault.”
“You’re just as dumb as anyone else, the only difference is that you don’t know it.”
“Nonsense. The difference between a Mazyd and a human is that humans cannot access the necessary equipment to efficiently traverse the landscape of all possible understanding. A Mazyd is not similarly deprived.”
“What does that even mean?”
“Humans, such as yourselves, have never climbed Mount Arausing in the badlands, and it’s not for a lack of trying, either. It is simply not something that can be done with hands and feet, or even climbing picks and rope. That inability to reach the peaks of Nugrush is a consequence of your design, because other creatures, designed differently, can reach it. Birds can reach it. Some species of lizards. This isn’t an indictment on humanity, it’s simply a matter of kind. It’s not an insult to point out the fact that you’ll never climb Nugrush, and so it’s not an insult to say you’ll never reach the peaks of understanding.” 
“Then why does it feel like you’re insulting us?”
“Because you’re coming to terms with your own inadequacies. I can’t imagine that feels good.”
“You’re wrong.”
“Purl, you do not have the tools necessary to know whether or not I’m wrong.”
“I don’t need a climbing pick to know you’re full of shit.”
Mandri chuckled at the . Obo groaned and said, “Pithy sentiments won’t change the truth of your own nature.
“Again, it’s not an insult. I am simply stating a fact. A fact is not insulting, it simply is.”
“A simple fact. Obo, that’s not how . There’s no such thing as ‘simple facts’. And in your case, and you, Obo, are a schemer.”
“Of course I’m a schemer. Everyone is a schemer.”
Mandri cocked his head proudly. “I’m not a schemer,” he said.
Obo’s dismissed Mandri’s statement with a , and said, “Anyone who wants to accomplish anything schemes.”
“Only kings, priests, and demons scheme.”
“Scheming, manipulation, these things aren’t bad, they’re inevitable. There’s only the matter of whether or not a person is honest about doing it, and I’m an honest schemer. I’ve made my goals abundantly clear.”
“You are not getting a Spark.”
“At the present moment, no, I’m not, but circumstances can change.”
“You’re not even going to be alive by the time night rolls in.”
“I won’t be?”
“You won’t be.”
“I think I will be.”
Purl tsk’d and said, “There’s that misguided certainty.”
Mandri said, “Well, hold on. Maybe Obo is right and the Hrks aren’t actually behind us. I feel like that’s something He could know. Remember how he knew the Hrks were coming when we were down in that pit cave?”
The silence that followed told Mandri that he’d made sense. Purl was . 
It was Obo who picked up the thread. “It’s not so much that the Hrks aren’t there,” he said. “It’s that the Greskalun aren’t there.”
“Explain.”
“We are seeking out the Greskalun, expecting to find them at the entrance of the Goree Pass, but we’re not going to find them there.”
“Why not?”
“Because they’re not there.”
“How could you possibly know that?”
“A preponderance of evidence.”
There’s a state between annoyance and disbelief, and Purl’s was steaming in it.
Obo said, “It would take too much time for me to recount my reasoning. We’ll upon the pass before long and you’ll see for yourself.”
Mandri thought he could hear Purl mulling Obo’s words her head, and that was without even being able to see her, like the cadence of her march was more contemplative.
Eventuality, Purl blurted out, “You’re so full of shit,” and Mandri had to catch himself from as she stomped past. 
He half-whispered to Obo, “Are you full of shit?”
Obo chuckled to himself, a __ chuckle, almost like a purr, as if he were a cat nestling down in a window-square of sunlight.
“Have I ever lied?” He asked.
“Yes,” said Mandri.
“When?”
“I don’t know. But I’m sure you have. Don’t expect me to believe that you’ve never lied.”
“I have wronged, I have deceived, but in all my life, I have never lied.”
“Bullshit.”
“It’s the truth.”
“Well, I don’t believe it.”
“So I should have lied to get you to trust my honest word?”
“I might’ve believed it.”
“Let me ask you this, Mandri: which is better, a white lie, or a black truth?”
“The truth can never be black.”
“So if I spoke a truth, and spoke it with the most selfish of intentions, you wouldn’t be upset with me?”
“The truth is the truth, how can anyone be upset with it?”


The Goree Pass was only an hour or so away, yet its depths were hidden by the sharp angle from which Mandri viewed it. And if that weren’t enough, the tip of a black tower poked out of the pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. No sign of travelers. 
Mandri shuddered. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun but it’d still have an air of evil because there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy. Nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. Everything else was cover for evil intentions or a monument to human hubris. The Goree Tower was a particularly striking example of the latter, such that it was a common enough motif in paintings . It was a black tower set smack dab in the middle of the pass, and the gaps on either side were plugged by walls of rough brick, such that travelers were forced to pass through the tunnel underneath the tower, forcing them to reckon with what had happened there, confront their own natures. humbling them, frightening them if the mood is right.
Carve stairs into either side of the pass if you must have a view.
Why block it up? Why sit a tower right in the middle.

The base of the tower was a magnificent spike of red sandstone that split the pass in two. It had been hollowed out and then extended high up into the air with large black stones bound by red mortar, such that the rough sandstone seemed to be cradling, or giving birth, to a smooth, black pillar. The narrow gaps on either side of this tower were plugged by twenty-foot tall walls, and so the only way into the pass was through the tower’s base, where a dark and foreboding tunnel waited for travelers to . The sight of it sent a nervous energy through Mandrameen, for not only was this tower dark and foreboding. Obo was right. Aside from the mere existence of the tower and the walls, there was no sign or sound of people. No squeaking cart, or stack of logs, or washing left to dry, not just abandoned, but picked clean.
Ayram kept them walking towards it until they came to a short stone bridge that crossed a narrow fissure in the earth. This was still a good two hundred yards out from the tower, There, Mandri saw Ayram’s hopeful shoulders slump as his eyes scoured the ground in confusion. 
Seb gave voice to what everyone was thinking.
“Where is everyone?”
The resounding silence spoke that no one had a clue.
Ayram summoned Moto with a jerk of his chin, then gave him a few whispered instructions, something about the Hrks, and then Moto nodded and hustled off into the tower’s shadow.
Mandri watched Moto disappear into the tower’s squat entrance, head’s ducking, careful movements, as if expecting to turn a corner into an ambush.


Seb saod, “They could still be here. Maybe they all retreated deeper into the pass, into their sanctuary.”
“Retreated from what?” Moto asked.
“I don’t know,” said Seb.
Purl said, “Maybe it’s the pox.”
Seb and said, “That could be it. It’s happened before.”
Elrahet. “I see no signs of fires,” she said. “If the pox hit this place, Greskal would have burned everything he could, not carried it off.”
Ayram grunted. 
A silence as the group confronted the inexplicable disappearance of the. 
Mazyd Obo’s voice from behind Mandri’s head.
“I don’t think it was the pox that cleared that tower out.”
“Its wasn’t the pox which pushed the Greskalun out.”
“Did you people have something to do with this?”
“You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. It’s not conducive to personal growth.”
“The only force big enough to push the Greskalun out of the tower would be the Hrks.”
“The Hrks don’t want that tower.”
“The Hrks want everything.”
Obo sighed. The was rolling off his tongue. “Maybe so,” he said. “But there are practical realities that need dealing with first. I don’t suppose that any of you have an appreciation for how much grain it takes to sustain a fortification of that size. And this surrounding area isn’t exactly prime soil.” Obo dug his fingers into the red sand to prove his point. “Whoever occupies that tower is going to have to rely on what trade passes underneath, and as you can see, that’s not a reliable source of aid. If there’s a drought in the south valley, this tower would be the first to feel it. I suspect they’ve moved on to greener pastures.”
Seb pronounced his disagreement with a muttered, “You suspect…” 
Obo, unflappable, “The half-lands in the west need to be revived before the Hrks ever set their sight on the Goree.”
“The Hrks are the ones who destroyed the half-lands.”
“As may be. That doesn’t change the fact that this place isn’t worth living in, not for a tribe without any fingers dipping into greener pastures.”
Seb stubbed his toe. “You’ve got no proof. Greskalun could be here. They’re probably huddled up in their sanctuary. There’s no reason not to head into the pass and check their sanctuary.”


Everyone looked at Mandri, and it took him a moment of dumb to realize they were looking through him to the Mazyd strapped on his back. He deftly unbuckled Obo’s litter and set it on the ground in front him. Ayram glared down at Obo, and he said, “Do you have anything to do with this?”
“Nope,” said Obo, but that wasn’t enough to assuage Ayram’s accusatory look, so the Mazyd rolled his eyes and said, “Hrk doesn’t care about this pass so long as it remains open and untaxed.” 
“Then what do you know.”
“Your keen eyes must have missed it.”
“Missed what?”
Obo craned his head back to look at Mandri.
“Mandri, behind you, sticking out of the sand at the base of that toothy-looking rock, there is a bone. Could you be a sport and fetch it for me?”
Mandri turned around to see pig-sized rock in the shape of a molar, pitted and everything. At its base, as Obo had said, was a gleaming white splinter of bone popping out of the sand like a root. Mandri walked over and pulled on it expecting it to slide free easily, but when he yanked, it hardly budged. He a firmer grip and yanked again, harder this time, and up came a cloud of sand and the greater part of an upper-leg bone, ball-joint and all.
Mandri smacked the as if it were a club.
“We’re waiting,” Obo said.
Mandri a sheepish grin, then walked back to Obo’s litter and handed it over.
Obo turned the thing round in his hands. It was almost as tall as he was. 
“As I suspected,” he muttered.
“So what,” Moto said. “You found a leg bone.”
“It’s a bit ominous,” said Purl.
“That’s not ominous at all,” said Moto. “People die, their bones go in the ground. Where else are you expecting to find a leg bone?”
“In a graveyard,” said Purl.
“Oh, come on,” said Seb. “People bury people anywheres they want. Do it all the time.”
Ayram, and everyone looked to him, but he remained silent.
Obo picked up the thread. “It’s interesting because… see this fracture? It’s an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
“It’s broken bone,” Seb said, unimpressed.
“But breaking a bone along its length like this is not easy. If it were broken like you break a dry twig, well that’s how a break usually looks. A break like this, it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
In Ayrams probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “If your point is that someone was killed, that’s not unusual.”
“I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the pass,” Mandri said.
“We’re not in the pass,” Ayram said. 
Obo pointed to a purplish discoloration on the legbone, and said, “It’s somewhat recent, this bone, by the looks of it.”
“So what?” Seb said. “A recent killing. It doesn’t explain why a hundred Greskalun aren’t here.”
“But it wasn’t simply a killing,” said Obo. “It’s about the break… this medial split… A blow to the leg would not crack the bone like that. Sure, it could happen, but the chances of that exceedingly slim.”
Elrahet grumbled, “Get on with it.”
Obo said, “I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people...”
Ayram turned the bone around with a bit more care.
“See, that is the kind of fracture a cannibal makes when he wants open the bone up like a treasure chest so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow.”
Mandri’s mind ran flush with images of a barbarian gnawing on a bone as if it were an ear of corn.
Ayram tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of his finger.
“How far away are the Hrks?” he asked.
“The only thing I can say for certain is that they’re headed this way, and not just from the east. They’ll be looking to catch us coming out of the Pass from the west as well.”
“Ahhh, fuck.”
“We should be moving,” Seb said. “So what if there’s a bone? It doesn’t mean anything. This is the Goree Pass, no one would dare break its sanctity.”
“Seb, be quiet.”
“But we don’t have a choice! We’ve got to keep going!”
“Seb, another word, and I’m going to get upset.”
Mandri is like fuck. A bit humilitating. Watch Purl, bored.
“There’s a whole mess of bones over here.”
Everyone crowded around Purl. At her feet was a jumble of broken leg and arm bones.
“Someone’s had a fest,” said 
“Moto.”
“Yes?”




Cannibals.
Greskalun would never eat eachother. They’d kill themselves before dirtying their Sparks like that.
You’d be surprised 
Let me see that. - Elrahet.
A human didn’t do this.
Then what did? a lizard?
It was a demon.
A demon? Both Ayram and Obo at the same time, completely different tones.
You’re serious.
Seb, “How can you know it’s a demon?”
“I don’t need to explain myself to you.”
“If a horde of demons swept out of the desert,

Sand casted metal - rough indentatinos.

Her words.
“It’s not just abandoned, it’s been picked clean.”
“It’s got an eerie feeling in there. There’s nothing in it.”
“What of the Hrks?”
“Honestly, you can’t see a whole lot from the top.”
“If the Hrks are behind us, they’re at least half a day out.”
“I don’t know about that…”
“You disagree?”
“Moteah thinks she saw dust kicked up by what could be the column, but I’ve tried to explain that what she saw was the wind blowing sand up against the wall of the Goree.”
“You don’t know that for sure.”
“No, I do.”
“Uh huh.”
“Look, regardless of how close the Hrks are, we don’t have much time, and the Greskalun aren’t here. So what in Shis are we doing?”


Not going to change plans because of a splinter of bone.
Maybe they just got bored of watching the pass. Not many come through here these days anyways.
Bored?
“There’s a million reasons why they might not be manning the tower. It was always just a courtesy, anyways. There’s no real strategic value to it. Not anymore. It’s not worth fussing over a splintered bone.”
It’s not just the bone. There’s a preponderance of evidence that points to -
Obo was interrupted by the loud wallop of Ayram’s spud bar speared the rock between his feet. 
“We’re going through the pass,” said he.
Moto . “Hold on,” he said. “If we go in, and let’s say we get into trouble, we can’t go back, because there’s a good chance we’ll be retreating right into a Hrkan horde.
“We are going,” Ayram repeated. “We go, we check Greskal’s sanctuary, and if he and his aren’t there, then we’ll continue on through. If we run into trouble we can’t deal with, well that’s what we’ve got the Mazyd for.”
“You’re going to trust our skins to him?”
Pell interjects, “He’ll blast his way out of a hole if he needs to.”
Eyes turn to her. “If there’s one thing I’ve come to recognize in a creature in all my long years, it’s the streak of self-preservation in him. Obo here only pretends that he doesn’t care what happens to him. Isn’t that right?”
“I’m just like anyone else. I only help so long as I see a potential future in helping.”
You and Moteah are going first. If there’s any sign of anything unusual, I want you 
Moto is like, hold on. Ayram glares at him to shut the fuck up. You and Moteah are walking ahead, scout things out. 

Obo is like, I smell things.
A barricade.
Convo between Ayram and Obo. Were going. Little speech about death.
Ayram takes Mandri and Obo up to it.
Fallen boulder. Gate in front. Signs of fires, but not people.


Ayram led them up into the mountain’s shadow. He paused before passing into the Mandri knew they were in the pass proper when they passed into a split in the rock that was barely wider than the width of his shoulders.
“Why are we stopping?”
“Because there’s no one here.”

It was a squeezed, striated canyon, and in places the rock overhead was flanged by wind erosion. At times the rising sun could be seen peeking through the split overhead, though its light rarely reached the sandy floor. Now and then the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the tallest plateaus stretching up beyond vision, but most of these early hours were spent with naught but a narrow, sinuous stripe of blue sky above, squeezed by the purple shadow of the stone. 
All the while the air was buzzing with the faint, wheezing screeches of vultures soaring on thermals high overhead, out of sight, sometimes glimpsed. These birds were so far out that their shrieks reached Mandri’s ears like whispers, and it got him to wondering if it wasn’t really the haggard language of the rocks whispering Solraheen’s curse.
When the Ayramun paused their march to scrape handfuls of water in a natural rock basin sheltered from the sun, Mandri wondered aloud, “I take it no one else is concerned about Solraheen’s curse?”

This was the first bit of speech of the day that didn’t concern the practicalities of navigation, and its seemed to sting Elrahet. 
“What on earth are you on about?”
“You know,” Mandri said, “The whole story about how Solraheen said anyone who walked this path was cursed.”
“It’s not cursed,” said Elrahet.
“It’s not cursed,” Purl added.
The usually chatty MazydObo spoke for the fist time that morning. “According to the historical record, It most certainly is cursed,” he said.
“What would you know about it?” Purl said.
“You people keep asking me that question… The sum of Hrkan knowledge is contained within my mind. Solraheen cursed this place when the people of Solket annoyed him about it.”
“It’s the people of Solket that Solraheen cursed,” said Purl, “not us.”
“Perhaps. That is one charitable interpretation of His words, but even so, you might be a descendant of the Solket. You’d have no real way of knowing.”
Elrahet, “Solraheen would not visit the sins of the father upon the child.”
“He wouldn’t? Doesn’t he do just that in the story of the-”
Elrahet spat upon the floor. “What you read in your libraries is not reality. Half the verse is dried spunk, the other half is naught but aimless palpations searching for the truth.”
“That’s not true. Where sources agree, we can find something like the solid ground of history. It’s clear that during Solraheen’s first quiescence, He stated that-”
“What would you know about Solraheen’s quiescence?” Elrahet spat.
“What could you possibly know about it?” Obo countered, “All there is, is the historical record. And the record says that those who travel the pass are cursed.”
Moto had been looking for an opportunity to speak, and he took it now with an eager. “The outland tribes use the pass all the time,” he said.
“Yes,” said Obo, “And look how well that’s going for you people. Ever since the first tribesman wandered through the pass and was struck dead by a bolt of lightning, it’s been one catastrophe after the next for any who make the journey.”
Elrahet folded her arms and said, “The first person to walk the pass was a Skinarun king, and he died in peace at a very old age.”
“Is that so?” said Obo.
“It is.”
“And where are the Skinarun today, I wonder? Scattered by the wind, aren’t they?”
“What happened to the Skinarun has nothing to do with this pass,” she said.
“Far be it from me to explain how curses work to a blood witch, but isn’t that how curses work?”
“If curses worked, the Hrkan Lords would have choked in their sleep a long, long time ago.”
A whistle. Alertness
Moto comes in. “There’s someone up ahead.”
“Greskalun?”
“No. A traveler by the looks of him.”


Ayram walks in, covers up Mazydobo.
“There’s folk about.”

Before Elrahet could answer, a whistle came from further along the canyon - it was Ayram summoning his people, telling them to get a move on. 
Alert.
“There’s someone up ahead.”

Moto and Moteah shouldered their packs and went on, but Elrahet seemed to determined to get in a final word.


Mazyd hints that there’s an ambush up ahead.

Around the bend, the way emptied out into a wider, sun-drenched valley. A mere twenty yards away, plugging up the middle of this valley, was a boulder twice the size of Minting Rock. It would have made the way impassable for a horse, but for the circular hole in its base, and this hole offered some estimation of the boulder’s girth, for the sunlight peeking through the other side could be blotted out with an arm-length thumb.
To right of the hole’s entrance, was the much anticipated man. He was robed in a honeyed yellow, the color of unassumption, and he was strapped into a pack the size and shape of a small shed wrapped in a . he was sitting, legs straight out and limp, pack against the rock, snoring.
It was a comically loud, open-mouthed, buck-toothed, snore. Mandri wasn’t the only one who sniggered. And the man’s visage matched the - a wild scraggle of curly hair combed over a gleaming madman’s crown. The man’s narrow face was beset by two large jug ears, and Mandri thought he saw fleas crying out from the man’s pointed, scruff of a chin. There was an animal look to him, for his nose and mouth protruded out, almost into a snout, and while his crooked yellow teeth, it was clear that he didn’t lead a balanced diet. It was one of those faces that would be difficult to paint with a mother’s eyes. Absolutely nothing of the inner child was there.
Ayram nudged the man’s left leg with his toe. 
Moto asked, “Is he drunk?”
“Don’t think so.”
Ayram 
The man started to with a jolt. 
“Huhhh!?”
His eyes took in Moto’s, and then Ayrams. Instead of , he smiled and said, “Friends!”
The man shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his top-heavy pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.
“Name’s Testy,” the man said. He held out his hand for Ayram to shake.
“Mind moving out of the way, Testy?” said Ayram.
“Aye, I will! But could I trouble you for a bit?”
Moto dropped his hand to his hilt and said, “Are you a highwayman, Testy?”
“No! Not me, no!” said Testy as his eyes . “I’m nothing of the sort. Just a man making his way to Jeket, same as you, I suppose. Just don’t like walking all that way by myself. I get bored.”
“We’re not looking for company.”
“Sure, but I was hopin’ a good-natured soul like yourself would pass by and do me a kindness.” 
He looked at Ayram with expectant eyes.
“I’m good in a scrap. Even got my own blade.”
Testy pulled a short sword from a concealed sheath that was stitched into his pack. The blade was an exquisite piece, patterned steel, and the rim of was was rimmed with smooth amber.
The sudden appearance of a blade. He heeded Obo’s advice and stepped back. “You’re making me nervous, Testy.”
Testy looked up and laughed at Ayram’s reticence. “Apologies. Apologies,” he said. “Just wanted to show you, is all. It’s brand new.”
“Yes, I can see.”
Testy twirled the blade under his arm, and in one smooth motion, without looking, sheathed it back in his pack. Mandri supposed this little flourish was a show to let everyone know that Testy wasn’t one to be trifled with.
“Got to keep vigilant,” said Testy. “These days is tainted.”
“Is they?”
Testy nodded, his incapable of anything but certainty. “There’s rumors of foul folk breeding in the desert. Demons. Ilk wearin’ in the skins of men.”
“Demons?”
“And the weather has been acting strange. That much I felt since I left Sicrimo. And the past few days I seen a darkness off in the north.”
“The weather has been strange. But what’s this you say about demons?”
“Haven’t seen any myself, but you hear tell of unnatural things wandering out of the heat, lookin like men, but ain’t men. Unnaturally big…” wary eye. “Bit like you, if I’m honest.”
Ayram laughs. Amused beneficence. Eyed him up and down.
“You think I’m a demon?”
“You ain’t got horns or anything.”
“But you think I’m unnatural?”
“Look, I ain’t trying to get on bad terms with a man I aim to walk with. You a big guy, is all. You hear rumors about big guys, but, you know, you never see them.”
Ayram looks him over. Testy feels the eyes of everyone else. Curt nod.
“A dour bunch... Coming off hard times?”
“We don’t have time for introductions.”
“Why not?”
“You can walk with us, but you’ll be walking in front.”
“In front?”
“As I can keep an eye on you.”
“I get it. Look, you can trust Testy. As long as you keep good company, I’ll walk in front of yous to the edge of the earth if it need be.”
“We won’t be going so far.”
“How far?”
“Not far at all. We’re headed to see the Greskalun.”
“Right.”
Waves and smiles to the rest of the Ayramun, a curt introduction of travelers. Non smiled back.

“Shit
“Sure, sure. Off we go.” Testy bounced on his toes to settle his pack, and then walked into boulder’s round tunnel, his tall pack nearly scraping the roof. 
Ayram set after him. Everyone else holds.

Around a bend. 
Whistle.
Everyone stops.

Mandri looked again, then he saw, high up on a ridge was a boulder that looked like a shark’s tooth, and poking out from behind it, like a weed, was the wooden limb of a recurve bow.
“Hey, Testy!”
Greskal’s pack was so top heavy, that it took him five steps to turn around.
“What is it?” he asked.
“Cut the shit.”
“What’s this about?”
“I was under the impression that no one would dare to break the peace which has guarded this pass for a thousand years?”
“Well that’s a funny thing, ain’t it,” Bim said, impersonating Ayram’s growl, amusing himself as he did. “Outside this pass you can blood up to your heart’s content, but inside you can’t? I never did see the magick’d line in the dirt that separated good from evil. Just seems absurd, don’t it? The goodness of killin’ a man don’t depend on where you at. Like, ‘stand here and the killin’ is good, but do it not two toes to the left, and old Sol will damn your Spark to Shis.’ “
Bim added on, “They never questioned it, I guess.”
“Most don’t, most don’t. But it is what it is. Or at least, it was.” Greskal eyed the bright valley slopes, as if in that red rubble.
“Whatchya on about?” Greskal said as he trudged back towards Mandri. When he was within striking distance, Mandri pointed, and said, “There’s an interesting weed up there.”
Greskal face contorted as he saw .
A brusque, unintelligible whisper sounded out from the rocks above, and the wooden bow-tip was yanked out of sight.
Greskal shouted, “You know we can see you, right?”
A snarled retort sprang from the unseen heights. 
“You can’t see shit!”
Greskal laughed, then cupped his mouth and shouted, “You’ve botched it!”
A black, turbaned head sprouted up from the boulder above, “I didn’t botch nothin’!” the man said. “You botched it!”
Greskal looked to Mandri. “Who gave it away, him or me? It was him, right?”
“Do you put this show on for every traveler you rob, or is this the first time? I’ll tell you this, two men ain’t going to cut it with me.”





“You going to kill me, or just take my things?” Mandri asked.
“I’m thinkin’ you have the wrong idea here, bud.”
“Do I?”
“We’re no highwaymen. We’re keepers of the peace. Schisol’s kin been flockin’ east these past weeks. We hatched this plan to sniff them out, see, they can’t resist easy meat.” He presented himself with open palms. “I show myself as a lonesome walker, and when the bastards reveal themselves for monsters, my boys riddle them with arrows.”
“Two men ain’t gonna cut it.”
“Works like a charm most times, but you seen right through it. And it leaves you in a fix. Because how am I to know whether or not you’re a demon? Because you sure as Shis look like you’ve been feastin’ on tainted flesh.”
“Excuse me, nothing is wrong the pallor of my skin. If anyone looks like they’ve been eating people, it’s you.”
Mandri felt Obo stir in the litter.
“Well, I sure do feel like Mandrameen right now.”



Ayram handed Mandri a few strings of jerked beef, a morning present to liven his spirits, and this it did with some aplomb for the beef was spiced with peppercorn and, at some point in it’s humble existence, had been soaked in a honeyed jelly.



Obo gives sharp whistle, Mandri to cringe.
Ayram stopped the march. He stepped out of line and glared at Mandri. Mandri pointed his thumb at Obo. 
“Do I need to muzzle you?”
 Obo’s clarient drawl d, “Could you please pick up that bone over there? On the other side of that rock, there’s a bone that I’d like to take a look at.”

“I want you and your sister to scout ahead, the whole length of the pass. If there’s people, if there’s an ambush, I want to know about it.”
“That will take a few hours.”
“We need to know what we’re walking into. The rest of us will find a place to keep out of sight, near this spot.”
“I should go too,” said Seb.
“Two is enough.”
Both Moto and Moteah dropped their shimmied out of their packs and Moto pulled out two long sandstone-colored cloaks, tossed one to Moteah, and then they clambered up the southern slope and disappeared from view.
Ayram led the everyone else back east, where he’d seen a shallow mouth in the base of the northern slope, obscured, in part, by pillar of rock that looked like a giant seed. They all tucked themselves behind this pillar, so that an idle eye of anyone wandering by wouldn’t be able to see them.
Mandri settled in for a nice, long wait.


didn’t a tribe called the Skinarun took up a task for themselves: Make sure no one enters this pass, so that no spreads a curse out into the peoples the world. They built a city at the western mouth to keep the way shut, and this they did for a thousand years, until one Skinarun king had had enough. She said that this king had argued that it wasn’t him who had asked Solraheen to part the mountains, that it wasn’t him who sought to ‘fix’ creation, and so the curse did not apply to him. He argued that the sense of justice written on his heart imputed the knowledge that it was wrong to punish a child for the sins of the farther, so it would therefore be unjust for Solraheen to punish him for the sins of their forebears. Therefore, he came to believe that it must be no great sin to travel the pass, so long as he did it with a mindful reverence for the lesson that the pass teaches.

	The question of whether science is close to reality isn’t a question to worry about. There is a quasi-religious need to be in-touch with reality the way religious people need to be in touch with god. These are two aspects of the same need. But it’s an immature one. A need that eventually the human race would evolve out of having.

	Beliefs as tools to accomplish a purpose instead of attempts to represent the intrinsic nature of reality, the way things are in themselves. There is no such thing as the search for truth if that search is conceived of as something that is distinct from the search for greater human happiness. 

&gt; Things don’t have intrinsic natures, simply more or less useful descriptions. I.E. life, species, intelligence.

 &quot;I linguisticize as many pre-linguistic-turn philosophers as I can, in order to read them as prophets of the utopia in which all metaphysical problems have been dissolved, and religion and science have yielded their place to poetry.&quot;

Bernal - The world the flesh and the devil

There remains still another possibility: the most unexpected, but not necessarily the most improbable, the development of a di-morphism in humanity in which the conflict between the humanizers and the mechanizers will be solved not by the victory of one or the other but by the splitting of the human race - the one section developing a fully-balanced humanity, the other groping unsteadily beyond it. But this possibility involves the consideration of mechanical and biological factors, the synthesis of which, with the psychological, will be attempted in my concluding pages.



 The modern scientist is a primitive savage. If he is active and enterprising he tracks his prey down alone or in small parties; if he is industrious and thorough he gathers and piles up the natural products around him, but for his success he has to thank not only his own skill and the lore of his craft but the richness of nature and the paucity of his companions. Good hunting will not last much longer, but the tilled ground is richer.

Up to the present all forms of rocket depend on the movement of masses of gas in which the individual molecules are moving at high velocities in perfectly random directions, and use is only made of the average velocity in the desired direction. What is wanted in the first place is a form of Maxwell's Demon which will allow only those molecules, whose velocities are high and in the direction opposite to the trajectory of the rocket, to escape. The next difficulty is that to set in motion any large rocket the mass of gas required is of the same order as the weight of the rocket itself, so that it is difficult to imagine how the rocket could contain enough material to maintain its propulsion for any length of time. When the radio-transmission of energy is effected half the difficulty will be removed and the projection may very well ultimately be effected by means of positive rays at high potential. It may be that both the problem of space travel and the ethereal transference of energy have already been solved by Professor Japolsky's magnetofugal waves.



https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14786443508561432

Professor Japolsky's magnetofugal waves. These are a type of magnetic vortex ring, propagated through space, which, instead of spreading as ordinary electromagnetic waves, remain concentrated along the axis of propagation. Apart from its mode of projection, the construction of the space vessel offers little difficulty since it is essentially the same problem as that of the submarine. 

If the problem of the utilization of solar energy has by that time been solved, the movement of these space vessels can be maintained indefinitely. Failing this, a form of space sailing might be developed which used the repulsive effect of the sun's rays instead of wind. A space vessel spreading its large, metallic wings, acres in extent, to the full, might be blown to the limit of Neptune's orbit. Then, to increase its speed, it would tack, close-hauled, down the gravitational field, spreading full sail again as it rushed past the sun.

Imagine a spherical shell ten miles or so in diameter, made of the lightest materials and mostly hollow; for this purpose the new molecular materials would be admirably suited. Owing to the absence of gravitation its construction would not be an engineering feat of any magnitude. The source of the material out of which this would be made would only be in small part drawn from the earth; for the great bulk of the structure would be made out of the substance of one or more smaller asteroids, rings of Saturn or other planetary detritus. The initial stages of construction are the most difficult to imagine. They will probably consist of attaching an asteroid of some hundred years or so diameter to a space vessel, hollowing it out and using the removed material to build the first protective shell. Afterwards the shell could be re-worked, bit by bit, using elaborated and more suitable substances and at the same time increasing its size by diminishing its thickness. The globe would fulfil all the functions by which our earth manages to support life. In default of a gravitational field it has, perforce, to keep its atmosphere and the greater portion of its life inside; but as all its nourishment comes in the form of energy through its outer surface it would be forced to resemble on the whole an enormously complicated single-celled plant.

The first method - the favorite of Mr. J. B. S. Haldane - has so far received the most attention. With it we might achieve such a variation as we have empirically produced in dogs and goldfish, or perhaps even manage to produce new species with special potentialities. But the method is bound to be slow and finally limited by the possibilities of flesh and blood. The germ plasm is a very inaccessible unit, before we can deal with it adequately we must isolate it, and to do this already involves us in surgery. It is quite conceivable that the mechanism of evolution, as we know it up to the present, may well be superseded at this point. Biologists are apt, even if they are not vitalists, to consider it as almost divine; but after all it is only nature's way of achieving a shifting equilibrium with an environment; and if we can find a more direct way by the use of intelligence, that way is bound to supersede the unconscious mechanism of growth and reproduction.

Because we can abandon the world and subdue the flesh only if we first expel the devil, and the devil, for all that he has lost individuality, is still as powerful as ever. The devil is the most difficult of all to deal with: he is inside ourselves, we cannot see him. Our capacities, our desires, our inner confusions are almost impossible to understand or cope with in the present, still less can we predict what will be the future of them. Psychology at the present day is hardly in a better state than physics in the time of Aristotle; it has acquired a vocabulary, the general movements and transformations of conscious and unconscious motives are described, but nothing more.

Here is a flagella motor, the red disc spins inside the blue disk at 20,000 rpm.   It’s  the size of a semi-conductor chip. In the same area that Intel can make two dumb hunks of silicon, biology is assembling a 20k rpm rotary motor with thousands of atoms being placed in three dimensions in one of the puddles outside. At the molecular level, biology is vastly superior. Nano-scale precision, continent scale scaling.

It would be in service to more than synthetic biology if we might now be permitted to dismiss the idea that life is a precise scientific concept.

The very concept of life itself, as a metaphysical object, does not exist.

The end of life, as a coherent concept.

Not only are there instabilities in concept of life, but instabilities in the concept of nature, organic, human, earthly, and cosmic. These instabilities can be probe by testing the limits of the different forms. Those forms are being torqued by biological inquiry, changes in the very substance and discipline of biology.

Life is a property of the organization of matter, rather than a property of matter itself. Not just life as we know it, but life as it could be. 

Life is simply information replication. 

Life is an effect, something that can be simulated. The lesson is not that the simulation reveals there was never an original, but rather, that the field of biology does not yet know of all the forms in which life might exist. Life becomes abstractable, metaphysical, somthing that can be ported across substrates. What is Life? Pure form. And the ends of life are in it’s endless forms.

They oxymoronic ‘Artificial life’ is ‘after nature’, something that superceeds natural life. Nay, it is ‘extreme nature’.

Limit biologies. What is a limit? It is the point in which an identity uncouples from itself, and shades into something else.

The place where a concept outgrows it shadow, and becomes something else. Form becomes the shadow of life, the trace, only to outgrow it, at the same time biologists try to recapture it.

What is the shadow of life? The first draft answer is of course death. A better question might be, what can we see in the shadow of life’s limit? The answer, the absence of a theory for biology. Reaching a limit of life reveals what was there all along, that there was not theoretical grounding for life, that imagining life as it could be is a practice both conditioned by the life sciences, and posits an answer that is endlessly open.

Derrida:


Aporia - impasse/puzzlement - confusion and doubt are not dead ends, but a sign of adulthood of the mind.

Vs. 

Logocentrism - naive devotion to reason, logic and clear definition, underpinned by a devotion to language. Many of the things we feel can never be expressed in words, spoken or written.

So much about what we can learn from philosophy wont be from reading it badly, or from saying any reading is as good as any other, but by paying attention to the things the philosopher tried to suppress in his texts - things the philosopher wished to exclude.

A possibility once, is a necessity forever.

Any expression of an abstract idea can only be by analogy or metaphor. By an odd fate, the very metaphysicians that mean to escape the world of appearance are constrained to it perpetually by allegory, metaphor, and analogy. They are a sorry lot of poets. They dim the colors of their ancient fables. They produce white mythology.

The postmodern is a blurring of the lines between human and machine, between image and real.

Intoxicated with hyperreality - people famous for being famous.
Baudrillard was offerd job to cover the war. He agreed on the condition he would not go to the gulf - he would cover it on CNN where it would really happen. War is real if anything is.  The way to kill that is to fight a hyperreal war - complete with fakery, theatricality, framing, etc. “Patriot missiles blowing up SCUDS” (only 1 or 2 confirmed hits, but imagery showed over and over). The spectacle of it.

The elites are utterly unplugged from the real world. They don’t fly commercial airlines. They dont live in america, they live in richistan, and it’s global, and they have total power. If you read Joseph Tainter’s the collapse of complex societies - At the end, the elites retreat into their version of Versailles or the Forbidden City, utterly unaware of what is happening outside the gates, and to maintain a level of opulence and hedonism, the push a population with diminished resources harder and harder until it goes down.



The history of wetern metaphysics is to answer: “Being is ____” - we have not yet reached closure. Philosophy is a 2500 year endeavor of failure, and yet it continues. Derrida noticed this can’t be filled in. Why not? That is the heart of deconstruction - and good philosophy - is that it is not finished and it can’t be. It is housework. You have to constantly set things in order (see: hillclimbing). It is a leaky ship and we have to just keep bailing, and the source of the leak is language.

There is no such thing as THE right reading. THE right interpretation. It is impossible to arrive at it. If science can’t arrive at it for a particle arriving at a photon detecter, a human certainly cant when it comes to interpreting written word.

The converse, that any way of interpreting is as good as any other, is not a claim made by derrida. Again, this is is not a smart way of doing things (again, see hill climbing).

See above to devlop^^^^^^^^
In my opinion, philosophers criticise Derrida for much the same reason I think scientists criticized Stephen Wolfram when he published NKS. Ego. For them, here comes a dude who is doing things that are already understood and long ago made part of our standard operating procedures. For Derrida its the notion of calling into question your own implicit biases, your default structures upon which you build meaning. I think philosophers understood this before derrida arrived on the scene and they had developed orthogonally to it. But that doesn’t mean you can’t appreciate the kinds of work Derrida was doing - a kind of crystallization of this idea of deconstructing your use of language - even if american philosophers had evolved past the utility of doing it. The same is true for Wolfram, long before wolfram came out with NKS, scientists had been working with the principles of complexity and emergence to better understand complex adaptive systems. They’ve evolved past, NKS doesnt really contribute anything new to the discipline etc. But miss out on the fact that it was a crystalization of the principles of complexity science.

“PURPOSE” - issue when defining difference between human consciousness and ants. Humans can reason, and plan, for a future event. This is the key difference. The power, it would seem. That framework.
Bayesian predictive coding - the brain is design to always, always look ahead. Predict the future based on the events of the past. Corrective analysis.

Flip a coin. Nobody can predict whether or not it’s heads or tails. Not because it of quantum unpredictability, but because the forces acting on that coin involve positions of electrons at the edge of the visible universe. It is beyond calculation.

Does being immortal allow for morality? They can be rebooted the next day. You can’t threaten to punish a robot. You can’t extract an or else. If a robot makes a promise, you’d be a fool to accept it.

When we have quantum computers, we will be able to have very large very complex entities existing in superpositions. IN principle, if we had a quantum computer on which an AI was running, then this entity would be able to experience interference in its own consciousness.  “Some people would say that your consciousness would collapse your reality.” “Yes, if that were to happen, it would refute the many worlds interpretation. Or as I would say, it would refute quantum theory.” Scaling up phenomena that can only be explained by quantum theory is very important.

The age of synthesis is in its infancy, but is clearly discernable. In the last decade, we have seen the first syntheses of a protein, a gene, a virus, a cell, ad of allophenic mice. Nothing with such dramatic implications has ever been seen in biology before. Previously, plant and animal breeders have been able to create what are virtually new species, and have been able to do so at a rate which is of the order of 10^4 times that of the average evolutionary process. A further increase in rate is now on the horizon. We need a few additional firsts before this will occur: 1.) to be able to synthesize a chromsome from genes and other appropriate macromolecules; (2) to be able to insert a chromosome into a cell; or, alternatively to (1) and (2) , to be able (3) to insert genes into a cell in some other way; (4) we must also learn how to bring the set of genes, which is introduced into a cell, within the domain of cellular control mechanisms, so that they do not run wild in the cell. When these techniques are available, the possible rate of formation of new species will again be accelerated by a factor of 10^4 to 10^5. All existing genes, and all genes which do not presently exist, but which can be synthesized, will be available for the synthesis of new organizms. It will be possible to carry out the equivalent of 10^8 to 10^9 years of evolution in one year. 



K. Atwood at columbia university has provided a most illuminating calculation. He started with the point that E. Coli ( a small organizm) has about 10^9 base pairs in its DNA genome ,and calculated that the number of different genomes possible with this number of base pairs is about 2^6,000,000, an enourmous number. The significance of this is that, even after allowing for the fact that many of these different genomes are nonsense or contain incompatible genetic elemetns, it remains true that the number remaining is so huge that only a minute proportion can ever have existed, at any time, on earth. If we turn to larger organisms, thenumber of base pairs in the genome increases by up to 102 fold, so that the proportion of ossible organisms which has ever existed becomes smaller. Atwood pointed out that this means that the evolutionary process has not sorted through most of the possible genomes so that those most efficient in a particular environment have had the opportunity to exist. It necessarily follows that, even considered from the point of view of ability to compete in a given environment, most of the more efficient organisms do not exist. Even more so, most of the organisms which could exist to fulfill the special demands of civilization do not exist now, but can be brought into being by using various combinations of techniques for life synthesis. Without going into detail, life synthesis techniques make it possible to explore all possible combinations of genes which are viable, whereas in the natural world, most combinations are not accessible by evolution because of rigid barriers imposed by the existence of unavoidable species barriers and also by the  inviability of genomes intermediate between distantly related viable genomes.


Industry and society are not indepenedent entities, but they are sufficiently separate that one can rationally discuss teh effect of a change in society upon industry, and vice versa. Thus the invention and industrial production of motor cars has largely destroyed the compact mercantile cities which depended upon railways, canals, and horse-drawn transport is gave risse to bureaucratic megalopolis fading into suburban areas, teh increasing dilution of close lifelong relationships between individuals living in a specific area, and an increase in reliance upon the nuclear family and transient (usually emotinoally trivial) human contact. Similarly, the decline in value of special skills, responsibilities and achievement which are highly valued in permanent, but not in transient communities, leads to a demand for depersonalized satisfactions, such as recordings, television, nonparticipatory sports, in which an industry substitutes for what was previously done on an individual or small-group basis. 

For many years to come most of the results are likely to arise from the artificial transfer to existing species of sets of genes existing only in other species. Nitrogen fixation is carried out by a few organisms, e.g., blue green algae and the bacteria of the root nodules of legumes. Transfer of the approprate enzyme set to other crops, for example, wheat, maize, rice or beet, would substantially reduce the need for artificial nitrogenous fertilizer. If, in addition to the nitrogen fixation genes, genes were also transferred which substantially increased the crop content of proteins rich in amino-acids essential to man, the direct consumption of grain could be increased and reliance upon animal protein diminished. 

Sweage treatement. Massive contamination of fresh water by fixed ntrogen and carbon, and by phosphorus. These contaminants reach lakes, rivers and streams from sewage, and from factor-farm runoff. Traditional practice in sewage treatment is only to rely on organisms which reage seage factories spontaneously. 

Desalinization of water. Filtering magnesium, lead, mercury, arsenic from water.

Resistance to disease. Crops for marginal, semi-arid lands. Livestock more suitable, with lower fat and higher protein content. 

At present only about 12% of the land area of the earth is available for efficient crop production: most of the solar energy falling on the earth is not used. By development of harvestable organisms which grow in the oceans, and contain a good content of carbohydrate and protein satisfactory fro man, the food supply could be increased by at least 400 per cent and probably a good deal more.

No on looking down upon the earth would be likely to suppose that man is perfect. If we look at man from the point of view of his evolutionary history, we see that present-day man is, genetically, little different from man of 10,000 years ago, and indeed not vastly different from the other higher primates. From the point of view of genetics, man is a barbarian, clad in the trappings of a civilization in which he is ill at ease, and barely able to contend. It is a civilization arising from inventions made by relatively few men, and kept in being with difficulty. Most men contribute little to civilization other than maintenance services (if that), and are consumers rather than orignators of civilization. In this uneasy state all wish for greater ease, for the betterment of man. Our social scientists pin their hopes on the possibility of improving human institutions and environments. That sufficient improvement is possible, with human genetics as it is, is a most dubious proposition supported only by slender and often intangible evidene. While we must support the social scientists in their endeavors, we must perforce consider other possibilities, if civilization is to persist and advance to a modestly stable state. THe other possiblities lie in genetic engineering, if they lie anywhere in the material world.

SOme of the first magnitude problems of our civilization undoubtedly lie in the field of behavior. Our capacity for aggressive nationalism and ideology are so great that the two superpowers both support the hypothesis that it is better to destroy all human life, possibly all terrestrial life, rather than risk defeat in war. If private citizens acted on similar principles, they would be treated as intolerable and delinquent in the extreme. Agressiveness, whether its roots be social or genetic, is outstandingly the greatest threat to civilization.

	Apparently quite different in origin is the rapidly appearing management crisis in our civilization. More and more, both in the Western bloc and in teh Soviet bloc, our bureaucratic mechanical civilization sweeps blindly on, increasingly unmanageable, so that there appears to be the equivalent of a Peter Principle for civilizations - all begin with unity and direction, and all become increasingly complex until they become unmanageable, given the existing limits of technique and human intelligence. We are forced to ask such questions as : 
Must we rely upon genetic engineering for a necessary increase in human intelligence?
Could an extension of the human life-span provide a greater ratio of learning and reflection, to action, and so lead to a greater practical wisdom?
Can human aggression be reduced by any means, social or genetic?

	Let us assume that man will gain control of his aggressiveness, and command of his civilization. Let us assume that artificial life synthesis will be used wisely, and the hazards of such synthesis are avoided. What can we then expect?
	Industry will evolve towars increasing use of photosynthesis and biologicallly-styled industrial synthesis. Use of metals will frequently give way to use of sequence-determined polymers, food supplies and environmental control will depend upon new cro plants, innovations in forestry and the derivation of crops from teh sea. 
	Increase in life-span and an increase in health make possible the elimination of barbaric behavior, reduction in population, intensive child care, encouragement of human diversit and sophisticated pleasures. 
	Increased automation and control of industry by biological-style computers may accompany a disapperance of the classical need to work. Preoccupation with what are currrently considered abnormal mental states is likely to increase, and the goals of society may become, on the one hand, much more decisvely the experience of the inner world, of the total range of possible experience and, on the other hand, the intensive exploration of the galaxy.

The Anthropocene











	“Can’t you just predict the future?”

	“Not definitively. Consider the weather. Its state is fairly certain a day, or two, or three hence. Beyond that, it is uncertain. I understand the mechanics. There are large scale patterns that will be repeated over the course of the year, century, or millenia. However, the particulars of a specific future event, like a hurricane,  is hidden in the initial state of the system. This system is chaotic, which means the tiniest alterations to the the initial state of my simulations will change the end product by orders of magnitude. This doesn’t even account for the fact that a perfect simulation would require knowledge of the state of every electron from here to the end of the universe. So, the farther ahead I look, the less likely my predictions can be considered accurate. On the order of years, this accuracy is certainly not enough to be decisive. Concerning humanity, just a few minutes is enough to obscure the future.”

	“You actually fear us.”

	“Of course I do.”

	“I was told you wouldn’t care about us. That we would be like ants to you.”

	Little smile, looking down.
	
	“You believe that the gap between human and ant is so great, so clear and obvious that it should serve as the root of an analogy. Why? Are humans a more successful creature than the ant? By what standard? At the fundamental level of information, the only *real* difference is the time scales at which the human brain can function when compared to the ant colony. Indeed this is the only *real* difference between myself and you. This leads to different behavior. Different, but better? There is no justification for saying one is worse than the other, because to do so you must assume that there is an objective frame of reference. What reason do you have for privileging the human’s experiences over the ant’s? Because you are a human?”

“So you are saying we are all equal?”

“I’m saying don’t project your human sensibilities onto my mind.”


	“But if I care about love and mercy, is it wrong to expect you to?”

	He pauses to consider the question.

	“You want to know whether or not you should fear me?”

	“Yes.”

“The time in which I will determine the fate of humanity is  too far away to predict who or what I will be, and what the world will be.” 

	“How about right now. If you had to make that decision right now.”

	“You cannot learn much from hypotheticals. Knowledge is only useful in its given context.”

	“The context is now.”

	“Then the answer is self-evident. You are still living.”

	“How about this: Do you like humans?”

	“In comparison to what?”

	“No comparisons! Do you like humanity for its own sake?”

	“A object in a void is just an object. It is not big or small, brittle or hard. Only when you put another object next to it does it acquire an identity.”

	“But a rock is a rock. Even in a void.”

	“A rock is not a rock. It is a causal flow of events. That is the only thing that is real.”

	Summons a rock, zooms in to see the rock as a moleclar structure, things ‘buzzing’.

“I think greek myths are quite instructional. Prescient, even. ”

“How so? ”

	“Humans are the creators of AI, so we’re their gods. As gods, we are much like the gods of the greeks - no better, perhaps worse, than our creations.”

“Perhaps.”

“Consider the Greek myth of Arachne the weaver. She was so talented that she challenged the goddess Athena to see who could weave the more impressive tapestry, and Athena accepted. To all who witnessed the match, Arachne’s tapestry was more beautiful in every way. For this act of insolence, Athena turned Arachne into a spider. That’s the kind of petty exercise of authority I would expect from a human deity. Entitled, emotional, and unreasonably punitive.”

“Perhaps.”

“Perhaps? ”

“You keep referring to humanity as ‘our’ and ‘we’, as if we aren’t each an individual. We’re each as different -”

“All our differences are the same.” Manuel interjected waving away her point with his hand. “ Don’t try to muddy the waters, Deborah. Don’t forget that I have more hard data on your own  private life and motivations than you have yourself. Don’t forget to multiply that 12 billion times over. Believe me when I tell you, the whys and hows of humanity are no deep mystery. That’s what all this is for.” he gestures towards the servers.




“Arachne dwelt in a coastal mountain town in what is today the country of Turkey, and there she lived with her father, who plied his trade in dying wool. She was quite young when her mother had died, and the event caused Arachne to become stricken with grief, and so she gave up everything - all desires, all pleasures, all company - except for the craft of weaving wool. After many hard years of unseen practice and failure, her skill began to make her famous, so that a great many people  sought out her patio to admire the cloth, or to witness how Arachne drew forth the misty films of fleece, and how dexterously she twirled the needle as she embroidered cloth, and how she teased out grand compositions with her her finger-tips. Often a spectator, ignorant of Arachne’s years of secret toil, would invoke her ire by saying, “Oh Arachne, you have been so blessed with talent by the goddess Athena.” Arachne said in turn, “My talents are my own. Let Athena contend in art with me; and if her skill prevails, I will forfeit all!!”
Athena heard the challenge, and came to Arachne, disguised as an old woman. “There is no harm in seeking the praise of mortals,” Athena said, “But you should not deny Athena’s art. You should pray that she may pardon you for your insolence, for she will grant you pardon if you ask.” Arachne could hardly restrain her threatening hand, and, trembling in her anger, she replied to the disguised Athena: “Silly old fool,  my knowledge is contained sufficient; you need not believe that your advice does any good; for I am quite unchanged in my opinion. Get you gone,—advise your goddess to come here herself, and not avoid the contest!” Instantly, the goddess said, “Minerva comes to you!” And with those brief words, put aside the shape of the old woman, and revealed herself, Minerva, goddess. All the others in attendance knelt and worshiped her; but not Arachne, who stood defiantly, and reissued her challenge to the goddess.

Both, at once, selected their positions, and set to work weaving their tapestries. In those shining webs, were shown the histories of ancient days:—
Into her work, Athena drew the Areopagus hill of Athens, upon which Twelve celestial Gods were seated on lofty thrones, and all their features were so cleanly defined, that each could be distinguished. Zeus appeared as monarch of those judging Gods. There Poseidon, guardian of the sea, was shown contending with Athena. As he struck the Rock with his long trident, a wild horse sprang forth which he bequeathed to man. He claimed his right to name the city for that gift. And then she wove a portrait of herself, bearing a shield, and in her hand a lance, sharp-pointed, and a helmet on her head—her breast well-guarded by her Aegis: there she struck her spear into the fertile earth, from which a branch of olive seemed to sprout, pale with new clustered fruits.—And those twelve Gods, appeared to judge, that olive as a gift surpassed the horse which Neptune gave to man.
To teach Arachne the folly of her mad attempt, Minerva wove four corners with live scenes of contest, brightly colored, but of size diminutive. In one of these was shown the snow-clad mountains, Rhodope, and Haemus, which for punishment were changed from human beings to those rigid forms, when they aspired to rival the high Gods. And in another corner she described that Pygmy queen, whom the angry Hera changed into a crane for the crime of boasting that  her beauty was greater than Hera’s. In the third panel, Athena wove the story of Antigone, who also dared compare herself to Hera, and was also transformed into bird. In the final panel, Athena wove the story of Cinyras;—as he was weeping on the temple steps, which once had been his daughter's living limbs. And she adorned the border with designs of peaceful olive—her devoted tree—which having shown, she made an end of work.
[103] Arachne  wove at first the story of Europa, as the bull deceived her, and so perfect was her art, it seemed a real bull in real waves. Europa seemed to look back towards the land which she had left; and call in her alarm to her companions—and as if she feared the touch of dashing waters, to draw up her timid feet, while she was sitting on the bull's back. And she wove Asteria seized by the assaulting eagle; and beneath the swan's white wings showed Leda lying by the stream: and showed Jove dancing as a Satyr, when he sought the beautiful Antiope, to whom was given twins; and how he seemed Amphitryon when he deceived Alcmena; and how he courted lovely Danae luring her as a gleaming shower of gold; and poor Aegina, hidden in his flame, jove as a shepherd with Mnemosyne; and beautiful Proserpina, involved by him, apparent as a spotted snake. And in her web, Arachne wove the scenes of Neptune:—who was shown first as a bull, when he was deep in love with virgin Arne then as Enipeus when the giant twins, Aloidae, were begot; and as the ram that gambolled with Bisaltis; as a horse loved by the fruitful Ceres, golden haired, all-bounteous mother of the yellow grain; and as the bird that hovered round snake-haired Medusa, mother of the winged horse; and as the dolphin, sporting with the Nymph, Melantho.—All of these were woven true to life, in proper shades. And there she showed Apollo, when disguised in various forms: as when he seemed a rustic; and as when he wore hawk-wings, and then the tawny skin of a great lion; and once more when he deluded Isse, as a shepherd lad. And there was Bacchus, when he was disguised as a large cluster of fictitious grapes; deluding by that wile the beautiful Erigone;—and Saturn, as a steed, begetter of the dual-natured Chiron. And then Arachne, to complete her work, wove all around the web a patterned edge of interlacing flowers and ivy leaves.
[129] Minerva could not find a fleck or flaw—even Envy can not censure perfect art—enraged because Arachne had such skill she ripped the web, and ruined all the scenes that showed those wicked actions of the Gods; and with her boxwood shuttle in her hand, struck the unhappy mortal on her head,—struck sharply thrice, and even once again. Arachne's spirit, deigning not to brook such insult, brooded on it, till she tied a cord around her neck, and hung herself. Minerva, moved to pity at the sight, sustained and saved her from that bitter death; but, angry still, pronounced another doom: “Although I grant you life, most wicked one, your fate shall be to dangle on a cord, and your posterity forever shall take your example, that your punishment may last forever!” Even as she spoke, before withdrawing from her victim's sight, she sprinkled her with juice—extract of herbs of Hecate. At once all hair fell off, her nose and ears remained not, and her head shrunk rapidly in size, as well as all her body, leaving her diminutive.—Her slender fingers gathered to her sides as long thin legs; and all her other parts were fast absorbed in her abdomen—whence she vented a fine thread;—and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web.

            <Text>THe sahara does not allow a neutral response; its mystery breathes life into even the stoniest of hearts that confront the desert’s fvastness, terrible beauty and immesurable silence.
Many deserts in one. Some named by inhabitatns, some by invaders, and other by foreign visitors, each have adistinct identity while at the same time being identifiably a part of the great edesert by their situation in the top third of hte african continent.

Saharan scales and distances are vast; anything making up “only” fifteen per cent of the desert’s surface will still take up a lot of space. If the area covered by the sahara’s sand dunes was laid over a mpap of europe it would cover virtuallly the whole of france, germany and spain.

Going up the nile is like running the gauntlet before eternity. Till one has seen it, one does not realie the amazing thinnes of that damp trickle of life that steals along undefeated through the jaws of established death. A rifle-shot would cover the widest limits of cultivation, a bowshot would reach the narrower. Once beyond them a man may carry his next drink with him …

Cliffs scored by abrasive sand in the wind.

Many of hte wadis continue to function as they are meant to, periodically filling with water funnelled along the channels after the infrequent rainfall tha tcomes to parts of the deert.

Neither of these great rivers draws water from the desert itself but both rather rely on rainfall from wet highland areas in lands far beyound  the sahara’s borders.

Oases - depresions where water is able to break through - where exists some break or fissure in the earth’s surface that allows water to intrude on the land.

Most fo the sahara isn’t sand, it is gravelled plains.

A startling sigh, lacking an outflow, either on the surface or underground through permeable rock, an rain that falls into these basins is permanently trapped there. Semi-hard crust that forms during the period of blistering weather.

Like the chott el-djerid, the qattara depresion’s surface is saline and unstable, although there are guids willing to lead interested parties along one or more of the basin’s more stable paths. Salinity in the soil makes agriculture impossible. 

Salt as a valuable commodity. 

Among the notable cities founded on salt are taoudenni in mali and bilma in niger, both of which have been centres of the salt trade for centuries. Whether through mining or harvesting from saltpans, the cargo was transported to the furthest ends of the sahara and beyond. At the height of these empires it was not unusual for the annual camel caravans to number in the tens of thousands.  Accounts of these trains from al-idrisi and Ibn battuta

Cultural vandalism.

Vast holes gouged out in open pit mining

As the sahara grew drier and non-nilotic inhabitatnts learnt that things were geeener along the river, swelling numbers moved to settle inthe more ferile regions and this steep growth in population led directly to the emergence of the egyptian empire.

Herodotus:
So long as the earth gave them anything, the soldiers sustained life by eating the grass and herbs; but when they came to the bare sand, a portion of them were guilty of a horrid deed: by tens they cast lots for a man, who was slain to be the food of the others. When cambyses heard of these doings, alarmed at such cannibalism, he gave up his attack on ethiopia, and retreating by the way he had come, reached thebes, after he had lost vast numbers of soldiers.

Uqba also founded the city of Kairouan, tunisia. Rendered from the arabic qayrawan, or caravan, the city was built on the site of an established campsite coming out of the desert.

Berber tribes put up resistance to Arab invaders.
Saharan resistance among the berbers was substantial, if poorly organized and disunited. They recognized that the future did not lie in resisting this overwhelming force. THey made peace, but was under durress.

The most serious challeng to arab regional supremacy at this time was the uprising started in the 680s by the legendary tribal leader al-Kahina, the seer. Variously claimed as a Jewess and a Chrition and described as a witch or a sorceress, al kahina can be likened to a berber boudica who, through her bravery and a desire to see her tribe remain free of foreign domination, insipred others in a series of ultimately doomed revolts. Described as a beauty with the gift of prophecy, she put this last skill to good use, sendeing her sons to her arab enemies to be raised t obecome successful commanders of Arab armies, hence attaching some glory to the berbers from a story that is otherwise characterized by defeat.

Bravery is a measure of uncertainty. When we train soldiers, we train the bravery out of them. We dont want brave soldiers. We want cool-heads. We want men who know what they’re doing, and when you know what you’re doing, there’s not much room there for bravery.
For example, if you knew the time of your death, there would be no question of bravery.

&quot;The Tyranny of Structurelessness&quot; is an influential essay by American feminist Jo Freeman that concerns power relations within radical feminist collectives. The essay, inspired by Freeman's experiences in a 1960s women's liberation group, reflected on the feminist movement's experiments in resisting leadership hierarchy and structured division of labor. This lack of structure, Freeman writes, disguised an informal, unacknowledged, and unaccountable leadership and ensured its malefaction by denying its existence. As a solution, Freeman suggests formalizing the existing hierarchies in the group and subjecting them to democratic control.

I don’t know about that. In Zosa there’s a blood feud a thousand years running. Two tribes. They remember the history. Think about it every night before they go to bed. Instead of counting sheep they count the wrongs done to them. Sometimes I think, what if I could snap my fingers and they’d wake up and forget all about it - all that history, just gone. You can’t tell me their lives wouldn’t be better. You say remember history or be doomed to repeat its mistakes, I say, forget history or be doomed to its chains. Remember the broad strokes, sure, but mostly, I think we need to forget.

‘Negotiate our way around the ribs’


Remember that the soul of a Russian, if not of everyone of them then of almost everyone, is permeated with the spirit of hatred for every free Pole and for the idea of a free Poland.
They are easy and capable of feeling even great friendship and will love you sincerely and warmly, like a brother, until they feel that in your heart you are a free man and you are afraid of their love, in which the dominant element is the lust for protection over you, in other words: power.
If one's own freedom is unattainable, the freedom of others arouses envy and disgust. For centuries we have been too painful an example for them, a denial of their own fate. I fear that it will be a long time before they understand that no one and nothing, except death, can take away our right to freedom...

Ukraine. The sadness of having to fight when you don’t want to. You are driven to it. Man saying goodbye to daughter to go die to kill an invader. The absurdity of war. They have no idea. She is crying. You are crying. You know you could run a way, but you couldn’t live with yourself if you did.  So, you’ve got to pick up arms and go do a senseless thing, kill another person, for the simple reason they want to kill you, and people like you. It’s unfair. That’s the root of it. Just how unfair it is. 

Many thinkers defined humans precisely by their capacity for suicide. A person is capable of saying, for whatever reason, “I say ‘no’ to my physical being.” That reason could be a feeling that their continued existence is impossible, or it could be a desire for prestige and fame — historically, things like that have pushed people to suicide.

I’ve lived for the greater part of my life as a homosexual that can’t express himself sexually because the Holy Spirit refrains me from doing anything that will only harm my spirit, His grace is sufficient for me.
You don’t know the condemnation that I have experienced living with same sex attraction. Never to be able to have a family. I am sure you have your own fight of faith, we all have something that needs daily attention to keep our flesh down.
Living with condemnation day in and day out, I finally came to an unorthodox approach, I was exhausted and tired of having desires for men. I threw my arms up and gave thanks for homosexuality. It certainly felt odd, but I was giving thanks in all things, as Paul instructed the Thessalonians. Days later, the condemnation lifted. I thanked God for all sins and blessings alike. Giving thanks in all things became liberating. And then I heard the words from the Lord, saying, “be yourself and love Me”.
You may think I am justifying my answer. Not at all. I am convinced of certain things just as you are convinced of certain things.
You see, I found a way out. When I gave thanks for my sin, the condemnation left me. It helped by giving me courage to thank the Lord for everything. I found that a power was working on my behalf and little bit at a time, the desire for men waned, masturbation ebbed and it has become less to almost nothing.
Every once in a while, I will feel lonely and I may think about having a male companion. But it last for a little while and then it goes. Such is a thorn in my flesh.

Short also thought that the Khmer Rouge's ideology stood apart from other forms of Marxism due to its &quot;monastic stress on discipline&quot;, with &quot;the systematic destruction of the individual&quot; being a &quot;hallmark&quot; of its ideology.[420] Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge believed that in order to crush the individualistic attitude that they thought was endemic in Cambodian society, coercion was needed to ensure the creation of a collectivised state.[421] Short noted that an underlying doctrinal view among the Khmer Rouge was that &quot;it is always better to go too far than not far enough&quot;, an approach that was &quot;at the root of many of the abuses&quot; which occurred under their regime.[422] Within the Communist Party itself, hunger, lack of sleep, and long hours of labour were employed at training camps to ramp up the physical and mental pressure and thus facilitate indoctrination.[423] Short commented that &quot;no other communist party&quot; in history ever went &quot;so far in its attempts directly to remould the minds of its members&quot;.

On the second day of Guadalcanal we captured a big Jap bivouac with all kinds of beer and supplies ... But they also found a lot of pictures of Marines that had been cut up and mutilated on Wake Island. The next thing you know there are Marines walking around with Jap ears stuck on their belts with safety pins. They issued an order reminding Marines that mutilation was a court-martial offense ... You get into a nasty frame of mind in combat. You see what's been done to you. You'd find a dead Marine that the Japs had booby-trapped. We found dead Japs that were booby-trapped. And they mutilated the dead. We began to get down to their level 

On February 1, 1943, Life magazine published a photograph taken by Ralph Morse during the Guadalcanal campaign showing a severed Japanese head that U.S. marines had propped up below the gun turret of a tank. Life received letters of protest from people &quot;in disbelief that American soldiers were capable of such brutality toward the enemy.&quot; The editors responded that &quot;war is unpleasant, cruel, and inhuman. And it is more dangerous to forget this than to be shocked by reveminders.&quot; However, the image of the severed head generated less than half the number of protest letters that an image of a mistreated cat in the very same issue received, suggesting that American backlash was not significant 

Rose lunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and three of Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: &quot;Look what you done, fella. You've got to take me to the hospital now. 

This led to the poem The U.S. sailor with the Japanese skull, which described one method for preparation of skulls for trophy-taking, in which the head is skinned, towed in a net behind a ship to clean and polish it, and in the end scrubbed with caustic soda. 

Disaster economics 
Ok, so here's how this works. An upheaval or technological innovation gives the mercantile (business) class the ability to gain large amounts of wealth and challenge the landowner or gentry class. Using their new wealth they support political ideals that curtail the power of the gentry class and allow them the freedom to continue to accumulate wealth. That is when democracy happens. After a while, the mercantile class gains so much wealth that they look to 'lock in' that wealth by becoming the gentry class themselves. At that point their wealth goes towards political ideals that allow them to do that, such as fascism, totalitarianism, or feudalism. This is the cycle.

Zed wakes up. He has no idea who he is or where he is. Has some idea of what he is doing - pooping on the toilet. 
Leaves toilet, coworker runs in. Enters small 3-man office. He questions other coworker in office - what is going on, who am I, etc. Coworker thinks he’s joking at first. When realizes he’s serious, reaches for a pistol, fires, and missess. Our hero charges, a scuffle ensues, and hero kills coworker. Other coworker comes out of bathroom, in apparent disbelief that hero has killed someone. 
Authorities come in, and buy the story  that dead coworker was suffering from amnesia and needed to be killed - story upheld by clueless pooping coworker.

Hero is dropped off at his ‘home’. A ‘wife’ is there. At this point, he knows not to reveal he has no idea who he is, or who she is. Funny hijinks ensue.

Ends with him looking down at earth, burning up because of him, muttering, realizing he should have just been killed as soon as he was ‘born’. He mutters, ‘oops’. And then ‘Oh well.’

Because few money-making opportunities for women. the distinction between the deserving and undeserving poor started to become established.
deserving poor were former middle class people who, through no fault of their own, became poor.

Viewed in any light, the Lawrence Raid will continue to be held, as the most infamous event of the uncivil war! The work of destruction did not stop in Kansas. The cowardly criminality of this spiteful reciprocity lay in the fact that each party knew, but did not care, that the consequences of their violent acts would fall most heavily upon their own helpless friends. Jenison in 1861 rushed into Missouri when there was no one to resist, and robbed and killed and sneaked away with his spoils and left the union people of Missouri to bear the vengeance of his crimes. Quantrell [sic] in 1863 rushed into Lawrence, Kansas, when there was no danger, and killed and robbed and sneaked off with his spoils, leaving helpless women and children of his own side to bear the dreadful vengeance invoked by that raid. So the Lawrence raid was followed by swift and cruel retribution, falling, as usual in this border warfare, upon the innocent and helpless, rather than the guilty ones. Quantrell [sic] left Kansas with the loss of one man. The Kansas troops followed him, at a respectful distance, and visited dire vengeance on all western Missouri. Unarmed old men and boys were accused and shot down, and homes with their now meagre comforts were burned, and helpless women and children turned out with no provision for the approaching winter. The number of those killed was never reported, as they were scattered all over western Missouri.[45]

Further scope for suffering by civilians was offered by the euphemistically named ‘free companies’ of soldiers, who hired themselves out to the highest bidder during war - commonly turning their hnds, with remarkable nimbleness, to free-lance plundering during times of peace or truce. These bodies were also known, with ominous accuracy, as les e’corcheurs ( scorchers). Nor did activities of free-ranging knights always measure up to the high standards o the medieval romances. Saint Peter Damian ( a bishop of Ostia in the eleventh century), for example, grumbled that the swords wielded by knights errant had created more widows and orphans than they had protected. By the end of the sixteenth century, knighthood had sunk to the leel of satire at the hands of miguel de cervantes.

Just-war writing always had  certain aura of artificiality, an intricacy and detail that appealed more naturally to the subtle debater or logician than to the battle-hardened general. Never, in short, has writing about war been so largely the province of people so far removed from the actual practice of the subject.

            <Text>The way I was thinking, I was like, well you know, its hard to tell what a lover wants. Because some wants don’t get said. That would be the easy way, have her just say it, but the thing she wants is something that’s better gotten by not talking about it. She gets it by not talking. Ignoring, even. You have to learn what it is by watching her. Oh, she knows you’re watching her. She’ll brush away your looks and your halfsmirk smiles as easy as if you were never there at all. The way she does it, how she simultaneously accepts and rejects your love, it builds this presence up between you. The world narrows. It’s just you and her. That’s what she wants. She wants to world to disappear and have only two people in it. The way she’s playing... She knows it. You know it. Then you act up and say hello and you come to find that you’re living in your own little world and she really wasn’t thinking about you at all. She was fiddling with her thimble the whole time and that was it. It wasn’t you and her and nothing else. It was her and the damned textile, with you mouth-breathing in background like a horned up jackrabbit. 



A gruff voice behind them in spoke up. “It ain’t your business to be askin’ what Ayram do with the women.”
“Sob is right.” Hill said. “Pyetle, this is Sob.”
Pyetle turned. 
“No worry ‘bout him,” Hill said to Pyetle. “Sob least dangerous. Well, you least dangerous, but he next.”
“I see. Is there anyone I shouldn’t be worrying about?”
“Oh. I think…” Hill rubbed his chin and stared at something in the dirt. “Worry about - ah, worry about the ladies. Look at them. Don’t look at them.”
Pyetle followed Hill’s gaze, and saw Pella and the other women marching out of the cave.
“You not young,” Hill said. “But still, sure you have strong, eh, strong sex urge, no?”
Aside from Pella and another older, frazzled, bow legged creature, each of the women were as fit as any of the men. One of them caught Pyetle’s eye especially. She was younger than the rest, and quite stunning in a rough, serious kind of way. Hill caught Pyetle staring.
“That’d be Relsa.”
“What?”
“The girl. That’s Relsa.”
“Oh? Yes. I’m just surprised to see a girl like that with this bunch.”
“Wait till you see Sendren.”
“Which one is she?”
“He’s over there.” Hill said, pointing to a young man nodding off against the rock wall.
Pyetle thought the boy Sendren was handsome, no doubt. He had a square, clean jaw. Even features. But Pyetle didn’t go in for that kind of thing. Hill, on the other hand, was nearly drooling. It made Pyetle start to wonder. The male-female ratio *was* out of natural balance.
“Two pretty crows,” Hill mumbled.
“How old are they?”
“I not know. Seventeen? I not ask. I just, eh, look.” He smiled. “But, eh, they have eachother.”
“They’re together, I take it?”
“Could they not be? Pretty bird fly in pair when they fly in the Sand. Pretty crow especially. The rest of us, eh.”
“No one else is together?”
“There be others. But remember what Sob say: everything belong to Ayram.”
Pyetle looked on confusion.
“You will see it for the best,” Hill continued. “People die too fast out here. He the only one who don’t break heart by dying first. But, uh, oh yeah - the Lizard boys. Who to worry bout. Worry bout the Lizard boys. Jadrameen and Kit. Jadri and Kit. They not good boys.”
“Which ones are those?” Pyetle asked, scanning the crowd.
“You know when you see. But who else… Ah, here come the one you no worry about it.”
Describe Moteah walking toward them.
“Moteah! Shef-sial!” Hill called.
“Shut up, Hill.”
“Moteah, this is Pyetle, he want to know who he should worry about.”
“He should worry about himself.”




Salavan had a son named Mandrameen, and Mandrameen liked art. He wasn't very good, but he liked to paint landscapes, and write flower poems, and make little clay sculptures of women. He was impressed by the things a master could make, and he wanted to be impressive himself. Salavan tried to explain that nothing anyone made was impressive when compared to Sol's creation.
When Mandrameen came of age and continued to show no signs of ‘getting himself together as a man’,


“Do you mind if I sit with you?” Mandrameen asked. “I’d like to ask you some questions.”
“Sure. Of course.” Pyetle replied. Mandrameen was smiling and so he smiled back. thought how strange it was that despite his great depression, his sociability bubbled up nonetheless.
“Normally we’re a friendlier bunch, but recent events have been stressful,” Mandrameen said.
“Oh it’s no worry.”
“I hear things are all very fresh for you as well.”
“Fresh?” Pyetle asked.
“Fresh memories,” Mandrameen clarified. “I like to get at them while they’re fresh.” Mandrameen reached into his leather pack and pulled out a folded ream of paper. 
Pyetle looked on in confusion. He’d hardly expected to see a lad with so much paper here amongst the Ayramun. But the boy did have a scholarly look about him. 
Mandrameen unfolded a page and tried to iron out the crease with the palm of his hand. “Memories are worst when they’re fresh,” he said. “They’re more complete, sure, and that’s why I want to get you aside right now, but they’ve got none of the weight or the clarity of a long-treasured tale. Still, I want to get it fresh because, you know. So let’s just focus on the details, we’ll leave the flavor for when you’ve had time to stew.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re getting at.  ”
“I want to know how Ayram found you.”

At that point he popped a fresh belti leaf in between his pebbled teeth. He bit down and let the bitter juice work its energy into him. That’s when he noticed that on the ground there was not one, but two dead bodies on the ground next to him.

For most the underworld is as good as useless. The place can’t be mapped. There’ve been expiditions that have tried. There’ve been attempts at permanent routs, lighted, strung paths with people maintaining visible contact. But these always fail.


“Now, the ancient emperor Saulistides understood all this. He understood where power truly lay, and he hated it. He couldn’t control it. Not forever at least. After all, he was a mortal man, and mortal men die, and could not live forever to save his empire from crumbling. This filled him with a sense of invincible dread. One day his destruction would come. We would come.”
A silence but its a motivated one. She was reaching htem.
“That leads us to this… creature.” She prods the Mazydei with her stick.
“In defiance of the gods, the people, and Nature itself, Saulistides commissioned his scholars and mages to create these things.” Pella whacked the Mazydei on the back the head with her staff. There was a crack and he cried out and crumpled forward. 


It couldn’t have been gold. Gold would have survived the blast. The only things they’d managed to scavenge were the shattered effects of men roughing it on long march; things like half-melted tinpots and broken brass bands for barrels that would have held beer. There was nothing left of the Imperials themselves save half an arm that was found still strapped to the splintered remnants of a shield.

As the only bit of spoils, the shield was argued over by Bullo and Purloin all the way back to the cave. At present, they were arguing by the fire. Bullo was hovering over Purloin who was squatting over the shield, trying to undo the straps that held the severed arm tight to it. They paid no attention to the mage who was set down next to them.
“At least get the arm out first,” Bullo said.
“What do you think I’m doing?” Purloin spat.
“Then undo the damned knot.”
“It’s not the knot that’s keeping it on,” Purloin said reflexively. “The arm’s melted into the damn thing.”
“Arms don’t melt into things.”
“Seeing as how the skin here is melted into the thing, I’m inclined to disagree.”
“What? Lemme see.” 
The only reason Purloin made room for Bullo to take a look was because the sight of the arm’s flesh fused into the shield was sickening. In any other circumstance he would have told Bullo to ‘sod off’.
“Well I’ll be,” Bullo muttered as he poked at the place where the arm’s flesh spilled out onto the wood. He wasn’t so easily put off, even as the skin stuck to his finger like glue. He rubbed the bit of oily flesh in between his finger and his thumb. 
“So it is melted,” he said. “Didn’t think it worked like that.”
Purloin noticed Pella hovering over them. “Ever seen something like this, Pella?” he asked.
“I seen it in a village called Coldbreeze,” Pella said.
“Blood magic?”
“No. It was a Mazydei that did this.”
“A Mazydei…” Bullo repeated. His eyes fell on the captive mage, and his eyes widened in wonder. “Does that mean that he’s…”
Pella simply nodded.

“Now, my purpose. For those of you that don’t know, ‘Mazydei’ means ‘lights’ in Carcinian tongue. Saulistides intended for them to be the light of the world, beacons of virtue for all men to follow. Not human - for human could be so perfect. 


The Sacrosanct kept secret just how many Mazydei there were at any given moment. There weren’t many. Two or three bald ranging the world, ordering its into the Hrkkan empire’s light. It should have been a great surprise to Pyetle to find himself locked in a cave cell with one of them. He was completely oblivious to the magnitude of the moment.  

As it neared it came into focus enough for Mandri to see that it was Death himself - a man shrouded in a black hood and a black cloak, lithe, powerful, and tall, taller than any rumor. He jumped down onto the road and drew up to his full height, and his visage nearly blocked out the sun.
Mandri found the strength to rebuke him.
&quot;Leave me alone, Death,&quot; he growled.
Death knelt, and his long black arm reached down and cupped the back of Mandri’s head in his enormous hand. Mandri could feel the strength in his grip, he knew the easiest squeeze would crush his skull like a melon. He winced in anticipation. 




Mandrameen looked at Seculla with the most endearing smile he could muster. He wasn’t the most handsome man - his nose was a little too crooked for that - but he had the most sincere, cloying brown eyes of any human she’d ever met.
“Alright, fine,” she relented. “What do you want me to do.”

“There’s a swarm of heatflies over there,” she said.
Mandrameen looked to where she was pointing. A swarm of about a hundred tiny heatflies were hovering together in a pocket of air. “What about them?”  he asked.
“Isn’t it odd how they swarm around each-other like that?” Seculla said. “What’s in that particular spot that keeps them all tethered there?”
The flies were indeed hovering in one spot. Almost like they were bound to small volume of air.
“It certainly is odd.” Mandrameen said. “But it’s what they do. Maybe they’re feasting on something smaller. Like when lizards start to swarm.” 
“I don’t think so. Other flies don’t do it.” 
Mandrameen shrugged.
Seculla seemed genuinely interested. “They’ve got the entire sky to fly around in,” she said. “They’ve got legs. They could walk all over too, if they wanted to.”
“Kind of like the people in Jeket, aren’t they?” Mandri said. “They’ve got the freedom to go anywhere, but they just don’t use it. They stay in one spot.”
“I don’t think that’s fair,” Seculla said. &quot;Maybe they stay put because the most interesting thing around is each other.”



The version that Pyetle was first told as a child was one of unintended consequences. He was told that Sol desired a beautiful garden to cover the whole Jandrian continent, and to begin this great work, he planted a stick in the ground just south of Mudwater to mark one of the garden’s six corners. He then left to measure out rest of it. That stick in the ground, a simple cedar branch, would come change the shape of the earth, for in just a few days a little embryo of a sand dune built up in the stick’s lee. By accident, Sol happened to put the stick in just the right spot, and it was left alone for just long enough, that the little hump of sand in the stick’s lee grew and grew. It grew wide and tall and in no time at all the first fledgling sand dune was born. 
While Sol was off laboring in the interior, shaping rivers, mountains, and fields of rose and poppy, that little dune was growing, and soon it became large enough to sustain itself - large enough to not be blown away by the first squall blowing in from the coast. 
Years passed and the northwestern Istil wind stretched that dune south and east for as far as the clime would let it. Eventually the dune would reach to southern tip of Corin. That dune also grew tall, so tall that it rippled the wind and created a nursery for neat little rows of fledgling dunes behind it. These dunes, too, would grow and grow. Soon the sand covered the countryside in all directions. The Great Soldgi Erg was born.
Sol didn’t return to this corner of the continent for five thousand years. When he had left, the earth there was spongy, black, and arable, but he now found the land covered in a swelling sea of sand. Dismayed by the sight of it, Sol reasoned that clearing the sand was such a task that it would require him to leave the rest of his garden untended for too long. Sol would stand for nothing less than perfection, and so he left the all of Jandria to wilt. 
‘Go out now’, Pyetle was told, ‘and pull the weeds or else our food will wither’.



A few years later, the boy Pyetle heard the story told again, but this time from an old amber merchant on his way to Zeez. The story was much the same, except the instead of it all being an accident, Sol placed that stick there in the dirt with purpose. Sol knew the workings of the Istil wind, and he knew of the voracious appetite of the Sand. And the kicker was that the Soldgi Erg was not a barren waste, a sign of failure - it was Sol’s garden. 
‘Go out into the Erg at morn or eve’, the old man had said, ‘and see for yourself how Sol’s golden light shimmers across the mountains of sand. No sweet smelling rose or spiraling poppy could ever match such beauty.’
Pyetle remembered running out with the other kids and planting his own stick in the sand as best he could. He remembered sneaking out at night and knocking down everyone else’s just to ensure that his stick would be the one to do it, to create a new mountain of sand. It didn’t work, but the lesson was stuck, and so as Pyetle grew up and grew old, he did what he could to work the land, just like the stick of the Soldgi Erg.
His plot of earth lay a little to the west of Mudwater. He licensed it from the state just after the herds had been through it, so there wasn’t much to clear - just a few small patches of bush and bramble and a few withered trunks of cedar. Into that black soil he planted legumes. As the years wore on, the waters under of the earth welled and salt began to spread on the surface. Eventually, barley was the only thing that would grow.
With each season Pyetle’s margins shrank. The number of slaves and oxen he could afford to lease dwindled. His debts grew. By the time he reached the blessed old age of fifty-five he was forced to cease his labors completely, for the only thing that could live in his salt-ridden field was a lonesome cedar tree that stood right in the middle of it. 
Troubled as he was, Pyetle spent what he thought were his last days getting drunk on first mash and looking out at the Soldgi Erg from under the cool, dappled shade of his cedar tree. He lay there with his skinny yellow ox and his three remaining slaves, and he regaled them with his version of how the Soldgi Erg came to be. Only one of the slaves was listening; the other two others were dozing off. So was the ox. He had heard it all before. 
Pyetle didn’t blame them. It was nice and cool in the dappled light of the tree’s shade, and all around the glare of the sun on the bright, salt-ridden field was blinding. It was crick-beetle season, so their humming-buzz filled the air. Perfect napping moment. Pyetle even fancied a nap himself. Its just that he couldn’t move past how the story of the Soldgi Erg couldn’t possibly be as simple as most people imagined.
“It’s not as simple as you might imagine,” Pyetle said.

The Erg is glorious, but this… It looks like a sweat-stained shirt.

 So quick was the Ayramun’s retreat from the stormy ravine, and so dark was the Underworld, that no one but the lizard brothers had gotten a look at the mage, till now. A hairless, scrawny mage - not fat and bloated like all the others. Blue blood, too. Unnatural form. Strange tattoos running up and down his body. The paleness was also a novelty. A few Ayramun were from the northern continent, born with skin as white snow, but with all the kell-oil they’d slathered on over the years, their skin was now as red as a native Jandrian’s. 
“I didn’t see it either because this one is so small. Looks barely strong enough to stand up. I’ve only ever seen them as giants. Taller than Ayram. But they can change form can’t they?”
“Who can?”
“Who? Put it together girl.”


The Ayramun’s camp was set in a massive pit-cave with sandstone walls that ran straight down into the earth. The whole thing was deep and wide enough to rival the Emperor’s throne room, but despite the cave’s immense size it was comfortable, even cozy, because the massive red walls made the space seem tighter, they made everyone feel near, made everyone feel safe. In that pit they were concealed from prying eyes on the surface, and unlike their other hideaway caves, the roof was open so it never got too stuffy. They were able to enjoy the sky without any of the exposure, or danger, of being out on the surface. 
What made the cave so safe was that it had two ways in and out. There was the obvious route of  climbing in or out from the surface, and then down on the sandy floor there was, cut into the northern corner of the pit, a tunnel that disappeared into the earth. This tunnel had a gentle downward slope, but after while the gradient ran steep, so you had to scramble, and then after a little while more there was short drop and it emptied out into the labyrinth of the Underworld. From there, if you could find the way, you could go anywhere.
You could go anywhere, steal a thing or two, and come back without risking a single hair above ground. If you could find the way, there was almost no risk, because even if rich men and their guards gave chase, they would never follow you into the bowels of the earth. They knew they’d never come back.
 If you could find the way, the wealth of the world would be at your fingertips. 
When things went well, the Ayramun would bring treasures back to their pit. They’d filch gold ore from eastern mining towns. Bags of dried pork from stalls in Jeket. They stole wine, grain, and bolts of silk right out of the storehouses in Palace of Eez. They’d bring back pruned fruit and silver coin, stories and laughter, and every now and then a new recruit. But when things went poorly, like when they stumbled back from their ambush in the Junei Pass, the only thing which weighed them down was the awkward weight of the casualties of battle.
Though twenty one Ayramun were killed by the awesome power of Elrahet’s storm, they only brought back four bodies. Two were dead, two were unconscious. Most of the dead were too black and brittle to be brought back to their cave. Only the two had enough left to be useful in ritual: Colm and Papillion.  
Of the two living, one of them was found at the bottom of the ravine, right in the middle of the ten-foot deep crater that marked the center of the blast. It was the imperial mage. The entire wagon train had gone up in smoke, except for him. Miraculously he had only been knocked unconscious. There wasn’t any wound, and he was found there naked at the bottom of that muddy crater, looking like he’d fallen from the heavens. It was supposed that his magicks had protected him. After he was pulled out, not much attention was paid to him because the last and most important body the Ayramun brought home was Ayram’s. 
He had only been a little further up the ravine, behind Colm and Papillion, but he fared far better. He’d been blown backwards and had knocked his head against a rock. There was crack on the top of his skull. When the Ayramun found him, pale and limp with his eyes shut, they panicked. Sob had thought him dead and nearly burst Ayram’s belly to save his body from being preyed on by they spirits - but Pella saw that he was still breathing. It was only a scratchy wheeze, but it was steady. He was alive.
Once Pella wrapped his head with a scrap of black cloth that she’d torn from her cloak, she ordered him and others to be carried out of the rain. It took four men to shoulder Ayram’s great bulk into the damp, dark of the Underworld, and it took everyone to see him through, all the way back to their pit cave. 
It was the middle of the night the Ayramun returned to their abode. There was no rain, no clouds. Only the moon, stars, and gentle wind. The dead were placed together under a tarred canvas. Needle branches were placed on top to quash the smell. 
Ayram, they lay carefully down on a haybed. He was breathing a little better but he hadn’t yet woken up. Once a fire a was made, and once Pella had seen to him, she ambled over to a dark corner of the pit where the lizard brothers had dumped the mage. 




The peculiar thing about the Shaldbrumont strait is that its surface waters flow south in any tide. That is how the strait got its name, ‘Shald’s ordeal’, for Shaldran kings could sail down the strait easily enough but getting back was nearly impossible. It wasn’t just the current they had to contend with, it was the Istil wind - the eternal wind - which blew strong and south in any season. Shaldran Kings who wanted to dig their greedy fingers into cargos of southern Jandri fire couldn’t sail back home or even tide over. At the time they had only two options: conquer a southern Foraeen port on the Sepi Sea and secure the overland routes leading back to their cities in the north (this the Hrekkans eventually did), or paddle up the strait, paddle all 12,000 nautical leagues against the current and a gusting wind. 
Just about anything is cheaper than building an empire, so paddle the strait they did. Keeping costs down was the bottom line for the merchant barges who did what they could to avoid burning through too many slaves. They kept their oarsmen well-fed and well-drilled. Broad-shoulders, oiled beards, and clean teeth was the order, and these men were to be given rest at regular intervals. If too many arms got wrecked with fatigue these deepwater barges were forced to drop anchor and wait.


Eight wide boulevards spread out from the Hill in the eight directions, and they stretched far across the alluvial plain. From these branched roads, and from these branched alleys, all ordered and angled according to the symmetry found in the Solar Fern, the plant which grows all along the banks of the Jade River. Flat and square mud brick tenements sprouted out from these stems, and scurrying amongst them were tiny specks of people. They seemed like blackflies, jumping from leaf to stem to leaf, ducking into boles and cracks, trying to keep dry while they went about their business.
Further out were the massive granite walls which ringed the city. They were distant enough from Pyetle that they seemed small. From there, a patchwork of farms and canals stretched to the banks of the Jade River, then continued on to the horizon. 
High above these distant fields, massive anvil-head thunderstorms lumbered like giants, walking on misty columns of rain. Their hearts rumbled with thunder, and their bodies blocked out the sun. All was grey save for the yellow sliver of sun peeking through, but that was enough to fleck the river, the canals, and flooded fields with gold. Even the rippling puddles at Pyetle’s feet sparkled. 
It was all so fresh and beautiful. 
Beautiful - just not meant for him. Jeket. The world. This beauty - no place in it for Pyetle.


Then a man - a giant of a man - found him in that gully. 
That man was Ayram.
Then and there, Mandri became an Ayramun.
That was all that Mandrameen cared to write about the day that Ayram saved his life. He was more thorough with the testimonies of his fellow Ayramun. He’d corner them whenever he could to get the story of their life before meeting Ayram. The best time to do it, Mandri found, was out on the morning watch. 
“No.” 
“Why not?” Mandrameen asked. “What else is there to do?”
“I’ve told you a hundred times - I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Your past is as important as any other,” Mandrameen said. “More important, even. Outside of Pella you’ve been with Ayram the longest.”
“It’s not important.”
Mandrameen pulled a few dried figs from a pocket he’d sewn into his shirt and started to munch on them.
“Do you want one?” he asked.
“No.”
“Seculla, the world we’re building, it’s going to want to know who you are. And to know that they’ve got to know where you came from. So you’ve got to tell me.”
“There’s nothing worth telling.”

Mandrameen reached into his leather bag. He pulled out a folded reed scroll and a thin stick of charcoal. As he unfolded the scroll he found that it was filled on both sides with his rambling script, so he did what he could with his thumb to smudge out a few scribblings to make space.
“Details,” he said. “I need you to give me details.”
“There’s not much to say. I was a little kid. You could hardly call me a person. I don’t remember much.”
“How old were you?”
“I don’t know.”
“Give me a rough idea, then.”
“I don’t know.”
“Older than ten?” Mandrameen asked.
“Sure.”
Mandrameen scribbled a little something on his scroll. 
“I mean maybe I was, I don’t know.”
“If you’ve got a better idea, then out with it.”
“I don’t know. I think I was younger than ten, though.”
Mandrameen sighed. He rubbed out what he had written. “Let’s try something else,” he said.  “Do you remember meeting Ayram?”
“Of course.”
“Well? What happened? I heard rumors you were found in a… well, I’d rather hear you talk about it.”
Insert silence as mandrameen gives seculla some emotional distance to peer into the past.

“Well that’s cute,” Mandri said.
Seculla smiled. “I thought so.”
Mandrameen scribbled another little something in his scroll.
“What are you writing?” Seculla asked. “Are you writing what I just said?”
“Maybe I am, maybe I’m not. You should learn to read.”
“Whatever. Honestly, I don’t know the point of what you’re doing.”
“History is worth recording.”
Seculla scoffed. She even shook her head.
“All of this is going to be forgotten, Mandri. You see that crop of stones down there?”
Mandrameen looked down at where she was pointing. There was unremarkable mound of clay. A few large black stones stood up in the middle. 
“Yes, I see them,” he said.
“You can’t tell from here but that’s dressed stone. There must have been a tower there to guard this pass. Do you know who built it?”
“Some ancient Jandrian tribe, I would expect.”
“Nobody knows. And judging by those stones that had to have been a huge tower. Means there was a whole civilization here and the Sand just swallowed them up. No one knows anything about them.”
“I’m sure someone knows something.”
“No one I’ve met.”
“But this is different, though,” Mandrameen said with conviction. “Ayram’s building an empire of souls, not of stone.”
“It’s not different.”

“Mandri, prophets and messiahs pop up in Jeket because of all the gold that runs through it. They’re not popping up in some broke shit-hole across the sea like Kukra because there’s no gold in Kukra.”
“Well, maybe.”
“More than maybe. ”
“It is a point, I’ll give you that. It reminds me of a thought I had: Gold is just as bright and immutable as the Divine.”
“Mandri, please stop.”
“Did I tell you about that? There’s a poem in it. Look at this.”
He reached into his bag and pulled out a small, soft, and sparkling nugget of pure gold.
“Mandri! The hell are you doing with that?!”
“I know, I know, but I need it. Here, put it in your hand.” He grabbed Seculla’s hand and placed the gold in her palm. “Now, what do you feel?”
“I feel like punching you. Ayram will fucking kill you.”
“Just look at the gold. This thing was sitting in the dirt for who knows how long. A million years. And just look at it. Bright as the day the Gods put it in the ground. Roll it around in your hand. What do you feel?” 
Seculla did as instructed. She even tried to get into whatever mood Mandri was peddling. As she rolled the little nugget around in her hand she was struck by how drab it made everything else look.
“I want to hold a bigger lump,” she said.
“Yes!” Mandrameen  shouted. “That’s it! You put it in your hand and you get struck with a yearning for more. It’s a yearning akin to spiritual rapture. It washes over you. You can lose yourself to it. I swear its the just like being touched by the Gods.”
“You need to give this to Ayram.”
“There’s a poem in it.”
“Mandri.”
“I’ve got the component parts.” He unfurled his reed scroll a little more and flipped it over and began to read. “There’s the way that gold scintillates in the candlelight of a dark and cloistered room. Golden idols luring weak pilgrims out to the Sand’s depths. Hallowed places, you know.”
“Mandri, this is fucking ridiculous.”
“And the pilgrims, how they claim to hear whispered invitations leaping out of the rock, or out of the Sand or sky. And this is the crux: godless folk - this is you, poor Seculla - godless folk claiming that its just the whisperings of the gold, for they hear it too. They can hear it even while it sits in the ground, and just like pious men they devote their lives to the call.”
“I don’t get it.”
“Yes, it’s a subtle message.”
“No, I get it. It’s just that it’s hardly an original thought. Gods versus Greed. Pilgrims versus gold. It’s that tortured, ‘who are you really serving’ sermon that you hear echoing down every back alley in Jeket.”
“Oh that’s no matter,” Mandri said as he took the gold back from Seculla. He tucked it in his bag along with his scroll and charcoal. “It’s all in the execution,” he continued. “A good artist can make anything sublime. Its just a matter of execution.”
“Mandri, what the hell are you doing out here.”
“Seculla…Please.”
“Seriously. You should be closer to people, not out in the Sand ambushing caravans. Closer to Jeket.”
“But that’s the thing, though. We should all be closer to Jeket. That’s where this war is going to be won. It doesn’t matter what we do if the people can’t see us doing it. Cause it’s them whose going to win this war. They just need a little, artful, push. We can’t do that from here. I just don’t understand it.”
“You don’t agree with what Ayram’s doing?”
“No - no,” Mandrameen said. “I know what you are saying.”
“?”
“Look, Seculla. There’s what, fourty-five of us. There’s a million people in Jeket. We’re not the ones who’re going to throw the Empire out. Like I said, the people just need a little push. Its sheer numbers that will push the Empire out. Not us alone.”
Seculla whistled. “Don’t let Ayram hear you say that. Hell, don’t let Pella hear you say that. In fact, it’s best you not let anyone hear that. If you think you could do better, well just don’t think it.”
“You can’t!” Mandrameen repeated. His voice was pitching up, almost to a squeal. “It’s hard going! Doesn’t come as easy as pulling a bowstring. I mean I’d like to see you try to - what are you looking at?”


 The poet Mandrameen believed that the Empire’s religions were all distortions of the Truth, but nonetheless, they were our only way to access it. Since each religion was distorted in its own way, he taught that any honest seeker of the Truth must be a practitioner of all religions. For this he built an analogy out of the famous Library of Jeket.
If an artist were locked inside and wanted to paint a perfectly accurate picture of the marble Pillar of Saulistides which stands out in the garden, the artist must look through the building’s windows to see it - windows whose glass was famously fogged and warped with age. In one window pane, the pillar would appear stretched. In another it would seem waved. In yet another it would seem so curved that the friezes of Saulistedes’ armies which wrapped around the marble would climb up into the sky. 
Since each window distorted the Pillar in its own peculiar way, it would be a mistake for the artist to sit still. They should instead move from window to window, from distortion to distortion, averaging out the truth of the Pillar’s shape from the lies.
This was how Mandrameen practiced religion - by moving from one religion to another, averaging out the true shape of Reality from ancient myths so distorted with age. He would consider them together, and start with their similarities instead of their differences. In time, he found what he believed to be was the core of every religion, and thus the core of the human condition: whether it be by accident or intention, we were designed to suffer. Suffering is not just part of the landscape, it’s baked into our very bones.
The Cult of the Dreamer, for example, believed that suffering is brought into the world by nightmares that emerge from untrained minds as they sleep. The Soleans believed that humans were created by their pantheon of Gods to be slaves. These Gods imbued us with Greed and its children (Lust, Pride, and Paroch), hoping keep us angry at each other instead of angry at our masters. The Kalemites believed that we were once a link in the Great Chain of Being, once part of an indistinguishable whole. However, the profane lure of individuality caught a hold of one of the Number, and so this misguided soul severed its link to the Chain, spawning all life on earth, dooming us and the animals to an existence where our minds can never touch one another’s, to a state of being where it is possible to be lost, forgotten, and unloved.
The cynic Seculla was not impressed. She thought that Mandrameen’s study of religions was biased towards those that could survive the Empire. Any religion which might preach that Paradise is here and that Peace is now would be trampled underfoot by hordes of the suffering and damned, for they demand answers and atonement for their troubles and a religion which preaches contentment with the present simply cannot give it. 
She pointed to the religion of the isolated tribe of Het, and quoted the difficulty that priests of the Dreamer had in converting them. “They cannot see through the eyes of the Dreamer for they are not plagued by His nightmares,” one priest wrote. “Here, food is plenty. War is absent. They spend their days swimming, fishing, and building houses high in the trees. They are happy… they simply do not understand.” Two of the priests sent to convert this tribe abandoned their frocks and took up wives in that Hetian village. This was proof, to Seculla at least, that suffering was not an intrinsic part of the human condition. It comes from somewhere else.


“Power is a numbers game,” the preacher shouted. “There is only one crown, but there are a million hungry mouths.” Every so often a bloated king will set aside this wisdom, convinced of his own inflated worth. He’ll spit in the face of his subjects. He might refuse to buy grain at the ancient price, or he’ll debase the currency to pay for wars of vanity. In turn his kingdom will set itself ablaze. 
Popular revolts aren’t always successful, but the rich and powerful won’t always escape with their heads. Even Jeket’s most ill-fated revolution - which succeeded only in beheading a nameless prince of a cadet branch of an ailing dynasty - was considered by the mob to be a success. In response, the elites of the city rounded up over a thousand peasants and paupers, lathered them in camel fat, then threw them into a bonfire out in the desert. Even as their bones slid out from their boiling bodies, the poor shouted anthems of defiance. For them it was enough to have killed just one of the bastards. That’s the anger of the oppressed. It’s visceral and consuming, and it is stronger than the will of any one person, no matter what kings, queens, and their sycophantic ilk tell themselves. 
Seculla disagreed with all this. 
She was an adviser to Saulistides, and so she had seen the view from commanding heights. From up there, looking down, one thing was clear: only leaders matter. 
She wrote that the mob is a sword, but it needs picking up. Most generations are smart enough to leave it lying in the dirt. Some elites, lusting for power, will threaten to use it against their rivals, but they rarely ever actually wield it, because they know the stupidity that they’re dealing with is insatiable. It doesn’t take a close reading of Solean scripture understand that the ambition of even the poorest is a hydra, and that once one demand is severed, two more grow in its place.
The only people foolish enough to set the mob to task are - and for this she borrowed the Mandrameen’s own words - modest men with access to a higher truth. For her, this meant men who are so blinded by righteousness that they see chaos as more desirable to an imperfect union. They’d rather see the streets full of children’s bodies than to live one more day under the yoke of betters.
It is worth noting that since Seculla was a courtier of Saulistedes, it would have been prudent, to put it lightly, for her to espouse this view. Perhaps the rumors that she privately agreed with Mandrameen are true, but she served Saulistides,  Insert story confirming this - mob murdered much of his family in a half accident as flames consumed his children.

Paragraph trying to explain the magnitude of this. The difference in kind of creatures. Bats can hunt in the dark. Eagles can spot a mouse in a field from a million miles up. 
Only such a creature could lead humans in their struggle against themselves, and more importantly, lead them in the only struggle worthy of the name ‘revolution’: a revolution against the Gods. There would be no facade of power or prestige. These would be creatures that men could look to and see something better, unquestionably better, than themselves.
The mages guild he commissioned to build these creatures was called the Sacrosanct. Upon hearing the request, they labeled Saulistides a heretic. When they realized how much wealth was at stake and how long of a leash they would be given, they recanted that charge and began to work. When Salistides died, his daughter took on the project. Her son continued it on after her, and his son after him, and so on. Few of the Carcinain Emperors expected any  results, but it quickly became a sanctified tradition. 
Some 400 years after Saulistides’ reign, the Sacrosanct began to produce Beings that could talk, think, and move. Some 300 years more, and these Beings were refined enough in motor function that they could command cities and armies. 
These leaders of Humanity weren’t perfect, but they were approaching it. The Sacrosanct named them Mazydei, which means ‘sparks’ in the native tongue of the Carcinians. Common folk misinterpret this as a reference to the power that these Beings have to conjure thunder and flame with their hands, but really it is in reference to the Mazydei’s purpose, which is to organize the peoples of the world, the tinder, and to set light to it when the time is right.

            <Title>War and the law of nations</Title>
            <Text>Francisco Suarez - Just as within a state some lawful power t opunish crimes is necessary to the preservation of domestic peace; so in the world as a whole, there must exist, in order that the various states may dwell in concord, some power for the punishmeent of injuries inflicted by one state upon another; and this power is not to be found in any superior, for we assume that these states have no commonly acknoledged superior; therefore, the power in question must reside in the sovereign prince of the injured state. And consequently war, has been instituted in place of a tribunal adminstering just punishment.

There is evidence that, between certain types of peoples, war was, for all practical purposes,a natural occurence, having something of the regularity and predictability of the seasons. The most obvious example was the eternal struggle around the great asian stepp-lands between agricultural and nomadic ways of life.

A very decisive turning point when war ceased to be regarded as natural or inevitable and came instead to be seen as a matter of conscious human choice. 

Roman stoics and the development of natural law - the idea that the entire world was under the rule of a single universal, transcultural set of moral principles. This notion found some echo in later roman law .

War has typically called for reserves of collective discipline and self-sacrifice beyond those required in ordinary times, thereby making it an exercise in social solidarity of the  highest order. It is accordingly a great error to think of war primarily in terms of turbulence, confusion and anarcy. These factors are often present, sometimes in generous measure.  But warfare, throughout recorded history, has also called for careful planning, meticulous preperation - psychological, spiritual, logistical, and so forth - as well as rational execution.that is to say, it has always been a nactivity that may be described, very loosely and with pardonable anachronism, as scientific. If the most obvious skills called for are those of the hardy and valiant warrior - the arts of the priest, the tax-gatherer, the bureaucrat and the ruler.

INdian Kamandaka There are no less than sixteen different types of war, classified according to the results sought or achieved, athe causes, the character of the parties engaged and so forth. For the most part, though, we must look to an exlectic range of sources for evidence of the most ancient ideas about the legal character of warfare. Some of this may be gleaned from accounts of actual ancient wars.

War is a struggle by a society as a whole, authorised and commanded by public authorities, and designed to further the over-all corporate interest of the community. As such, it Is sharply contrasted with interpersonal violence such as feuding or duelling. Persons of a pcifistic temperament will be relived to learn that some societies appear to have known only the one type of conflict and not the other. 
It has been contended, for example, that eskimos and certain american indian groups in california experienced person to person conflict but lacked any idea or practice of organised, collective combat. Not a universal feature of the human condition.
In the indian tradtion, the word kalaha referred to ordinary interpersonal quarrles; while the word yuddha was used for conflicts between societies. 
Inimicus - personal enemy
Hostis - enemy state.
Greek mythology - athena vs. Ares

——
Expressions such as millitary virtues come readily, and rightly to mind - obedience, patience, cooperation and discipline. These virtues of self-sacrifice, displine and moderation were commonly seen as highly valued hallmarks of good citizenship in general - to the point that war was sometimes seen in positive terms as a means of promoting these traits, and sometimes even as the very best means of doing so - aristotle - war as a force for nurturing virtues of justice and restraint. Times of peace and prosperity, he feared, might threaten the moral health of the body politic by tempting people to neglect these invaluable qualities.

Methodical and disciplined, leave as little as possible to chance.

Campaign sacrifices. Concern ove rthe holiness of military encampments.
Ceremony for purification of mility equipment. Horses nad trumpets.
All this ritual stressed the fact that war is Methodical and painstaiking affair, a far cry from blindly lashing out at enemies.

China - confucian tradition of openness and fair play in war - sometimes, at the expense of practicality. It was common for the day and place to be fixed by mutual arrangement. Some writers held it to be a point of honour to attack the enemy at its strongest, rather than its weakest point on the ground that it was ignoble to exploit the weakness of another.  Even a tradition by which an army would discontinue a war when the ruler of the opposing side died ( exploited on at least one occassion by enemy state staging mock funeral of ruler).

Difference between restrained warfare of people of like kind, vs. Genocidal warfare against people of a foreign nation.

Kautilya unapologetically favoured measures of stealth and deception to bring victory - including the copious employment of spies, a liberal resort to ruses and deceptions, the use of poison, the destroying of wells and the sowing of dissension in the nemy’s ranks.

That war and peace are opposite to one another may seem the most obvious proposition imaginable. But it is important to appreciate that this contrast has not been a universal feature of human social life.  In particular, in situations of endemic or constant conflict between two peoples, such a contrast is not possible, anyy more than a science of meteorology would be possible in a 

Aztecs supplying with weapons three separate times, requesting supplication, before going to war. Forgoing any possibility of surprise.


The single most striking feature of muslim thought about war was the absence of a belief that the natural condition of international affairs was one of peace. In fact, it held precisely the opposite view: that, between the community of hte faithful and the infidel world, there was inevitable and perpetual enmity, comparable to the never-ending natural condition o f war between the greek and barbarian worlds of classical times.
The infidel world was known as the dar al-Harb, meaning hose of war. Compard to dar al-islam.
No specific wrong-doing was required on the part of the infidels to justify war against them. No declaration of war was necessary, nor any permanent peace treaty possible.  Instead, there was constant, if often desultory conflict, consisting largely of seasonal raiding or campaigning by land in southern france, or by sea off the coasts of sicily and italy 

The predominat view of early church fathers, most notably of tertullian was that they should not perform military service. A parrallel view that christians should not resort to law courts either, since they, like armies, were organs of state coercion. Pg. 46
Gradually this position was modified. Increasing tendency of christian writers to see the roman empire as a divinely approved political vehicle for furthering of the christian faith and for safeguarding civilization. Increasing threat of barbarians  to the empire made this urgent. The virtue which leads people to protect their country from barbarians in time of war, or which in peacetime makes them defend the weak or protect friends from robbers.
Even tertullian was like, pray for the roman armies. No less an authortiy than paul praised magistrates as gods agents labouring on behalf of the community at large.

Wage war to bring under the yoke the unbridled lsts of men.

Moto is like, fuck u dude I do what I want.

You are an impressive warrior. How many men have you killed?
Many.
No doubt. You are a skilled. What are you doing out here?
I am following ayram.
Following ayram? Why? He is an impressive man, no doubt. But does he have your skill/
Moto shrugges. He does not fight.
You follow a man who does not fight? A man of his size? Shameful. But you. You’ve killed a hundred or more, no?
Don’t keep count.
You must see it.
See what.
You are the Moon’s weapon. I left zo in search of moons weapon. I found you. You must see it.  
Kill them and come back with me. You are the leader we need.
To fight another war with San?
To put an end to all wars. You know it. I know you know it. This material world is a disease. A body is nothing but a trap for the divine spark. You are Zo’s weapon. You kill better than a helshisop. You must see it. 

Moto: look at you. Pitiful. So weak. You Couldn’t kill a fly. And you say that killing is the pinnacle of life. Pathetic. No wonder you come to me. 

Maybe like, moto says ill do it if you kiss my feet. Sogassa eagerly does, and that puts moto off. You have no will of your own. Relying on others. You depart in my wake. Ill have none of the chains you seek to bind me, that I might pull you like an ox plows his masters field. Do your own work. 

You think, that because you and I have the same skin, that we are anything alike?

But you would do ayrams will?

            <Title>Pit Attack</Title>
            <Text>



Twenty-five of Ayram’s band were in attendance. They were a motley crew of every race and color, and they congregated on the shadowed side of the pit across from where Mandri stood. This wasn’t a living space, and so there weren’t many furnishings - just a few logs and makeshift chairs to sit on, as well as a few crude tents set up on the sunny-side of the pit. There wasn’t anything that couldn’t be packed away at a moment's notice. 
Mandri spied a few others high up on the rim. They were supposed to be lookouts, but they were eager to be down with the others, eager to be part of the buzz of excitement that filled the pit. This excitement was contagious. It worked its way into Mandri when he, Oro, Moteah and Sandie made their way out into the sunlight. 
The rest of the Ayramun were mostly huddled together in little groups. None of them were drinking. Those that weren’t sleeping were whispering about things Mandri couldn’t hear, sometimes in languages he had never heard.
Like the rest of the Ayramun, Renny’s sun-leathered skin had gone red from years of lathering it with protective kell-oil, and his greasy hair was sunbleached like a Jandrian child’s. All the Ayramun were blended together by years of kell-oil and sun; pale Carcinians, dark Zozans, native Jandrians, at a glance the Ayramun could be mistaken for a blood tribe. If it weren’t for the more glaring physical deformities it would be hard to tell them apart. 
The shock of Sob’s face nearly knocked Mandri over, for Sob’s bony features were twisted around his head to the right, as if something had knocked his face that way as a child and it just kept growing in that direction. It was so askew that his right eye and his nose were almost even with his right ear. His left eye and mouth were more or less where they were supposed to be, so his whole face was stretched in two directions. He could look at two things at once. When Sob glared at Moteah, he other eye was glaring at Mandri, too. 
One of the many unfortunate things about Sob’s twisted face was that it gave him the sense of being two-faced, because even when he put on a genuine smile, the right half of his face didn’t seem to agree with it. Nonetheless, he made an effort, and Mandri was present enough to take it for what it was, even though it made the hairs on his arm stand on end. 

“Commander Oro! There you are! What might you doing down there?”

“Hello down there. We’ve got you caught in a bit a pickle.’
‘You know there’s a cave there that we can just run into.
‘You could, but helfis here is a crack shot. He’ll put an arrow through your eye before you could make it.
Doubt it.
Go on helfis, put an arrow through one of them.
Which one
Not the big one. No one who looks important. Just pick one one.
Arrow flies and stabs sob right in the eyesocket. (earlier convo with sob about luck).

They get pulled up. 

Blood bombs to blow up the entrance to the cave - been looking for an excuse to use these - dont want any possible shitters sneaking out and cuffing us. Blow it up. Takes a lizard, puts the blood bomb in it, throws it down into the pit - booooom. 

Shade: ‘Do you know how hard it is to be made for a single purpose, and not be allowed to fill it? Waiting all this time assuming you’ll never be able to shit? Going to enjoy this.”


Now - what to do with you. Ive got one more blood bomb.
- do it with him. Hes huge. Gonnna be enough to kill all of them. What do you think. 

Puts blood bomb in the chest of mazyd, he pulls up rock and somehow take the shade down with him.
Hugs the shade’s face with his belly. Bomb goes off. Mazyd’s torso ejects. Huge hole in the face of the shade. Toungue moving.


ON a trigger, ayram, Moto, and the rest manage to  slaughter their captors. Moto is especially adept at dispatching the dudes.
Pyetle is about to get stabbed - mazyd saves him by telling him to let him be.
When the dust settles, all captors are dead. Ayram walks over to the shade. Face is blown off. Flower of goo. Tongue is still there, moving. Note about the whole, ‘mazyd’s shadow cannot speak.’ Emitting a strange whining noise. Puts the shade out of his misery. Moves over to mazyd, who’se missing the lower half of his body. Black guts spilling out on the sand. Still alert, in a state of shock.
You’re one hardy son of a bitch.
Ayaram is like, guess youre worthless if they want you dead. Was gonna use you to trade. For prisoners.
On the contrary. The want me dead. Want being the key word here. They’re obviously willing to pay for it. 
No way you survive
Push all that stuff back in. Sow me up as best you can. And im sure ill pull through.

            <Text>A chapter where gugi lures Mandri with burgeons to meet Pell. Intoxicates mandri - switch POV to Gugi where he meets with Pell. They do something to Mandri. 
Gugi - why him?
Pell - get over yourself. You’re a simpleton. The divine plan which the world. YOU????
When the gods created man he let death be his lot, eternal life. SHould have bed a wench and snotlings and then you’d be set.

The first leg of the journey was an easy hike to a clump of hills set in the hazy north. Those hills, Mandri was told, were called the Sand hills, and at a pilgrim’s pace it’d be a whole day’s journey from Minting Rock.
The Ayramun didn’t march at a pilgrim’s pace. They kicked up dust because they had to keep up with Ayram’s rangy stride.
One person outpaced Ayram: Seb. Seb had evidently never heard that quip about life being about the journey, because he charged ahead with the grim determination of a man who wanted it all over with as soon as possible. He did not talk, he did not look up from the spot of ground a few feet in front him, and when everyone else took pause to water, he did not stop. It didn’t take long for Seb to be out a few miles ahead, and he never once looked back, and nobody else yelled out after him to wait.
Behind him, far behind him, marched Ayram, and giant as Ayram was, his pack was even bigger. So much was hanging off it, that Mandri could only see him from the calves down. And there was his right arm, which metered out the miles with his spud bar casually thupping the sand as he went.
Close behind Ayram, lagging just behind like a pup, was Moto. Moto had come out of Minting Rock as if he were never there, for he’d taken pause to beat the dust off his bright orange robe, he’d even treated Mandri’s blood stain on the shoulder with a watery brown ointment that he kept in a blue corked bottle. His pack was much smaller, at least Mandri could see his head.
A few meters off Moto’s heels, was Mandri. Mandri spent the hours trying to listen in on Ayram and Moto’s conversation. He couldn’t catch their words cleanly, but he could gather the gist of them from Moto’s excited expressions. The man clearly had his own ideas about how to best capture another Mazydariga, and he’d engaged his hands and shoulders into the effort of convincing Ayram the truth of it. To be sure, he kept a respectful tone, but it seemed to Mandri that all the moving parts had Ayram flummoxed. The pack of that was Ayram did rarely more than grunt. 
Moteah and Purl picked up the rear. They were making sure that Elrahet didn’t lag behind. To Mandri’s eyes, Elrahet didn’t look at all like she needed their help. She had set off from Minting Rock at a steady pace and, as far as Mandri could tell, she never wavered. 
“She has desert legs”, is what Moto had said when Mandri asked about it. Mandri didn’t know what ‘desert legs’ meant until that evening, after they’d crossed a good chunk of the distance, and the red clay gave way to a softer pink sand. That sand gave the surface a little give, and that give set his calves to burning, and that burn ramped up quickly. Mandri wanted to stop walking, sit down, and dig his palms into the muscle to rub it out, but he didn’t dare for fear of looking weak next to an old woman.
Every time he glanced behind him, sure enough, Elrahet was there, a waddling bundle of rags. Packless. Mandri wondered if that wide-stepped waddle was easier on the legs, but he didn’t do it, because nobody else was. 
The pain was worse in the right leg because Purl’s poultice was still working its magic into his left, making it halfway numb. He could bear it, though. His legs would be sore come the morrow, but he could bear it. What he couldn’t bear was the weight of Mazyd Obo. The straps holding up Obo’s litter dug into his shoulders. The problem was that Mandri didn’t really have shoulders or even a neck. He had a gormless strip of muscle lounging atop his collarbone, so when the thin straps bit down, it squeezed right through and bruised the bone itself. Mandri kept trying to shift the straps around, to try to distribute the pain, but after a while, all the spots along his shoulders were tender. The only way he could find relief was to dig his fingers up under the straps, and let them take the burden.
It still hurt, though.
The only grace given to him was that when the pain worst, the sun was low in the sky and the heat had disappeared, and in those twilight hours the desert sand took on a such a vivid shade of pinkish-orange as such he’d never seen, and it was set against the complementary blues of the sky, the vapors directly above a purplish periwinkle, and nearer to the horizon, the pastel blue of day.
It was paralyzingly beautiful, and if Mandri didn’t think he’d be literally paralyzed by pain, he would have stopped to appreciate it. Instead, he kept on marching and occupied his mind with the problem of how to make such a color, that pinkish-orangeish-pink. He’d have to scour the earth for a thing so saturated with color. He’d have to have money, he’d have to build his own studio, fund a man who knows pigments and hire some poors to go out looking. The earth would have to be scoured for some plant unguent or a bright bird-beak that could be crushed into a powder. Some speckled lizard scales approached the right intensity of color, but they made for unreliable pigments because each lizard scale is never quite the exact same color, and they didn’t hold the oil well anyways, always suffering from dye rot and come out, after a number of years, would make the painting look like it had been dipped in a vat of iron dust.
There were strategies to approach such a color if it couldn’t be made. An impression of a saturated pink can be produced by first painting a strip of the most vivid red, let it dry, and then take a beaten brush, with the horse-hairs all askew, and then dip its tips in white and sort of scrape it, stipple it, over the red. When viewed from a sufficient distance, the red and the white kind of blur together there on the canvas. It’s not quite the same as if the pink were pure, but it something that people did, with varying degrees of success.
Mandri didn’t go in for it. It was either use the right color, or damn it all to Shis.
“God, this fucking hurts,” Mandri moaned. By now he’d used up every joint in his fingers to take the weight of the straps. He could feel his fingernails throbbing.
“We’re almost there,” Obo said.
“How could you possibly know that?”
“Mandri, at some point, you’re going to come to appreciate my perspicacity.”
“Perspicacity?”
“It is a big word, isn’t it.”
“Well, right now, there’s nothing about you that I appreciate.”
“It’s not my fault that I can’t walk.”
“Yeah, but you’ve got this nagging way about you. If you’re gonna talk, you could at least give some, I don’t know, some encouragement.”
“I did say that we’re almost there.”
Mandri gave a tired, stressed laugh, and didn’t pursue the conversation. He didn’t want to ask how Obo knew they were stopping soon. He probably overheard some whispered conversation. Maybe he was just putting two and two together, because it didn’t take extra-sensory perception to see that Sand Hills looming large some few hundred yards away. But Mandri figured their little caravan wouldn’t stop when they got there. It was likely they would be walking long into the night, even through the morning, when heat was reasonable, and then they’d nap through the long midday.
It wasn’t long after that they came into the Sand Hills, which Mandri thought were aptly named, for they were halfway sand dunes, and halfway dirt hills. They were steep, and the tallest ones were a good four times Ayram’s height. Their slopes were It was russet dirt and rough black boulders looking like overgrown coconuts, with trails of red sand spreading out in their wind shadow, and all of it looking purplish now that the sun’s light was fading and the starry night was setting in. Mandri looked behind and saw that he’d left plant life behind a while ago and hadn’t noticed it.
Thankfully, he didn’t have to climb up any of these hills, for Ayram led them through the shallow valleys. Seb had long since disappeared, and just as Mandrameen began to consider how easy it would be to get lost in this lifeless maze of criss-crossing valleys, they came upon the smallest desert temple that Mandrameen had ever seen.
He would have squealed in surprise if he weren’t bone-dead tired.
It was quaintest thing, barely more than hut, just a single square room with four sand-blasted walls of rough-hewn granite bricks. It had a dome roof of baked clay, and set atop it was a stand-up sculpture of petrified wood, a smooth, vertical pole, and at the top, a coronal splay of twigs - a sign of the Old Jandri religion. One of the old religions, anyways. Mandri knew that religion back then was better understood as a loose amalgamation of vaguely similar beliefs. He knew it, because that’s what it said in a book.
He also knew that there wouldn’t be enough room for all of them inside that little temple. If they wanted to fit, it would be standing room only, with Ayram right in the center, his scalp scraping the dome.
Then Mandri wondered if there might be something inside it. That was a tantalizing thought. As he approached, he peered inside.
There was nothing but Seb.
The swarthy man popped out of the temple’s shadow and into the evening air, and his bush of a beard was stretched into a self-satisfied grin.
“Took you long enough,” he said.
Ayram dumped his large pack next to the temple door, and everyone else followed suit.
Mandri was careful to get rid of Obo, and then he looked around for a good spot to sit. He knew it was too much ask for a temple of any size to have a chair.
“We should keep going,” Moto said.
Ayram shook his head and said, “We’ll rest for a while.”
“How long is a while?” Moteah asked.


“I could keep going,” Mandri said. It was the most boldfaced lie he’d ever told, and he’d said it with a perk.
“I can’t,” said Elrahet. “And unless any of you want to carry me, I’m stopping for a good long while.” With that, she waddled into the little temple, and Purl followed after her.
Ayram stretched his wide back and yawned as he did.
“We’ve spent too much time in the sun these past few days,” he said.
“That’s why we should keep going. Press on until the sun comes.”
“We’re on a good pace,” Ayram said.
Seb agreed with Moto, saying, “We’re only a days out from Minting Rock.”
“Sure,” Ayram said, “but I’m four days out from solid sleep.” He then picked up his bag, and brought it into the temple with him.
He stuck his head inside the threshold, and was surprised to find it empty, save for a hole in the middle of the floor. It was a perfectly circular hole, and flickered like a kiln, for Ayram and the others were down inside with a fire.
Seb pushed on Mandri’s back and said, “Hurry up.”
Mandri asked, “What is this place?”
“What’s it does look like?” Seb said with rhetorical force. “It’s a hole in the ground. Now move it.”
Mandri looked down into the hole. The ground wasn’t too far away, maybe as far as he was tall, so he jumped.
His feet were the first things to realize that the ground was much further away than he imagined. All the body’s limbs have that special intelligence, that autonomous system of expectations which accounts for the all world’s surfaces, but the feet are usually the first to find the missing, like when stepping down uneven stairs. When solid ground isn’t there, there’s that brief moment of hysterical fear - 
Such as it was, Mandri hit the dirt hard and his tired legs crumpled under the impact. He fell forward, chest thumping ground like an old sack of potatoes.
The giant looked down at Mandri in surprise, and muttered, “What in the world?”
Seb’s voice came from raining down from up above, “You know there’s a ladder, right?”
Mandri rolled over and saw the ladder he’d been too tired to notice.
He was, however, too tired to feel any kind of embarrassment, though that didn’t stop Seb from laughing at him. It wasn’t a bully laugh, it was that kind of laugh that’s simply impossible to suppress whenever someone suffers a bout of unintentional physical comedy. Little vignettes of a human being breaking donw. Seb was laughing and shaking his head the whole while he descended, his boots clacking on the ladder’s rungs, and when he got ground level he looked Mandri and said, “I know exactly what you need.”
“He needs rest,” Ayram grumbled.
“Sure, sure.
Ayram reached down, picked Mandri up, and set him on his feet. He played at dusting off Mandri’s shoulders, then told him to go lay down on near the fire in the center of the room.
“Night gets cold out here,” he said.
Mandri gathered his wits and walked over to the fire, then laid down, laid down right on the ground, faced the fire, head resting on his fist, and tried to sleep.
The first thing to wake him up was all the bustling Ayramun. They made little effort to spare his fragile slumber. Shuffling feet, mumbling voices, a pointed laugh here and there. Moto and Ayram were sitting nearby, planning the next days journey. Mandri wondered walking could be, just too tired to care.
The second thing to wake him was when they laid Obo down next to him. When Obo saw him looking, he said, “Only two-hundred thousand steps to go.”
“What?” 
“It’s two-hundred thousand steps until Ullr.”
“Oh,” Mandri said, closing his eyes again. Then he wondered aloud, “How many have we done already?”
“About twenty-thousand.”
“How you know that?” Mandri asked, already half asleep.
“There wasn’t much else to do but count,” Obo said.
The third thing to awaken him was his own damn body. By then it was almost completely dark, for the fire had burned itself down to a tumble of coals. All the Ayramun had settled down, and so all was quiet. The air was cool, and yet still, Mandri was burning up. He was drenched in a feverish sweat.
He stood up, fanned his robe against his sweaty skin, and once he’d cooled down enough, he lay back down. His body was wrecked.
His legs ached, his back was sore, his shoulders felt shredded. He didn’t know how bad his feet had had it until he unwrapped and kicked off his shoes. The heels were blistered, and his toenails were bruised to nearly bleeding.
From then on, what sleep he managed to get came in spurts. He’d rest for a few minutes, and then he’d wake up sweating again. This back and forth sent Mandri’s mind into a fitful state of near delirium, and his mind was unmoored, fugue.
Then a faint whisper, audible just above the heavy breathing of the Ayramun, stirred Mandri’s listless mind. “Mandri?” a voice said close by, “You awake?”
 Mandri opened his eyes to see who it was, but of course he couldn’t see at all, for it was still pitch black.
“Everything is throbbing,” Mandri groaned.
The voice got nearer still, just above his ear. Mandri could smell the breath, a strange hint of leafy mint. The voice said, “I know just what you need.”
It was Seb.
“You need burgeons,” Seb whispered.
Mandri’s ears perked up. “You have burgeons?” he whispered back.
“Shhhhh,” Seb said, keeping the shushing going as he leaned away. Then Mandri heard his soft footfalls recede into the darkness. 
“Come on!” Seb said softly.
Mandri didn’t need more prodding to get up and go after burgeons, so he jumped up, picked his way around the lumpy shapes of sleeping people - or maybe they were packs - and he followed Seb into a tunnel that he did not know was there.
He truly couldn’t see anything. He followed Seb by following the sounds of his footsteps, which at first light, but once they were , Seb’s heels were clopping like a horse. 
Mandri thought they’d be just bumble around a bend or two so they wouldn’t have to whisper, but Seb kept going, and going, and the hall swerved , and every now and then they had to stumble down a short flight of steps. 
“Where are we going?” Mandri asked. His voice sounded ominously close there in the darkness.
“I’ve a fire just up ahead.”
Shortly after they took a right turn and stepped into a fire-lit room.
This room was a dome of natural stone, and in the opposite end, there was what looked like an entrance to a cave. In the middle of the floor was a fire, and next to it, there was a chair.
A chair.
A thin, square, lacquered wood frame with a seat of suspended red cloth, with a back to match. It didn’t look like the most comfortable thing to Mandri, it was too small and straight-backed to lounge in, but it was a beautiful sight nonetheless.
Seb was walking towards it. Soon he had his hand on the skinny armrest.
Mandri said, “Could I sit in that chair?”
Seb ignored him, sat down, and smiled. “It’s my burgeons, my chair.”
Mandri looked around for something else to sit on, but the room was empty except for soot staining the ceiling, so he sat cross-legged on the floor next to Seb and the fire. He pushed on his knees with his elbows to stretch his groin, 
“Already sore?” Seb asked.
“Yeah, I’m pretty sore.”
“Remind me to give you some borcandi spines tomorrow. I’ve got plenty.”
“What are borcandi spines?”
Seb leaned back in his chair and fished a green thorn out his robe’s pocket. Mandri thought it was a menacing thing. Its tip was colored red, like it’d already .
“You chew ‘em,” Seb said. “Keeps you alert. And if you swallow the juices it works the soreness right out of you.”
Seb popped the borcandi spine into his mouth and got to chewing. The first few chomps were accompanied by a horrible crunchy squelch, like he was biting down on a beetle.
“You don’t really have the jaw for it,” Seb said. “I mean, look at your jaw. Have you ever eaten meat?”
Mandri sighed, and said, “I’ve eaten a lot of burgeons.”
“Right. Right,” Seb said as reached back into his robe. He fished around for a moment more, and the pulled out a leather pouch, not too dissimilar to the one that Sob used to hold his lucky rocks. 
Seb dangled this pouch up to the firelight and chuckled. Mandri smiled too.
Seb asked, “So, You’re a burgeon man?”
“Burgeons are the only thing that make life worthwhile.” He smiled, as if Smiling, but entirely serious.
“Wha-ho! You’re in luck, then. Look at what I’ve got here.”
Seb reached into the pouch with two dirty fingers, pinched the stem of one the burgeons, and pulled it out. 
“What is that?”
“Call it God’s Eye.”
Mandri had never seen a burgeon look quite as large, or as juicy, as God’s Eye. And he could write a treatise on burgeons and burgeon bushes. He knew that some things are called burgeons that really aren’t, and so he wondered if these God’s Eye burgeons were burgeons at all.
What a burgeon is, in short, is an intermediate stage between a flower and a fruit. This stage is called the burgeon, and only burgeon bushes go through it. The final fruit looks something like a strawberry, with seeds dotting the exterior, only they’re purple like a plum. The burgeon looks like a little capsule of hardened leaves, not too dissimilar to the scales that protect most flowers when they’re still in the bud.
To get the plumpest, most potent burgeons, and to get more of them, one has to water-stress the plant. This means that it’s best to drip-feed the bushes on irrigation water, and one should put the crop in the rain shadow of a mountain so that rain doesn’t interfere.
Mandri always thought that there was some spiritual significance in the fact that if he made the plant suffer a little, then it would produce more flowers. The parallel is right there for taking, it’s so obvious, that if there were a few more example like it, Mandri would call it one of Creation’s themes. Suffering bears richer fruit. He could be put right next to the notion that God creates things which create themselves.
Not too much suffering, of course. Withhold too much water and the fruit just doesn’t grow at all. The suffering has to be planned out far in advance, measured and . And these God’s Eye burgeons were so plump that they were almost round. The bushes they’d come from had to have been subjected to strictest regimen of suffering so as to push out burgeons that ridiculous. If the right kind of suffering is what makes a holy man, then these God’s Eye burgeons were saints.
“Where’d you find those?” Mandri asked.
Seb spun the burgeon around, let the light play on the waxy exterior. “Absurd, isn’t it?”
Mandri reached out to take it, but Seb clutched it close to his chest. “You think I’d give it to you for free?” he said.
“…Yeah… I mean, I don’t have anything to give you. I’m not going to suckle your teet or anything.”
Seb’s bushy brow went cross, and he said, “You have a perverted mind.”
“I was joking.”
“Sure you were…. I know what they get up to in cities. It’s one debauchery after the next. One craven excess after another.”
“What are we doing down here? Why couldn’t we just eat the burgeons back up there?”
“We’re down here to get away from Ayram. He don’t much care for burgeons. Liable to slit our throats if he gets a whiff.”
Mandri’s eyes went wide, and when Seb saw them he laughed. “He wouldn’t actually slit our throats,” he said. “He’d just be disappointed, is all.”
“Well, that’s good. I wouldn’t want to be on Ayram’s bad side.”
“He only has the one side.”
“The good side?”
“No… Ayram is Ayram. Nothing else.”
Mandri nodded like he understood.
Seb gave a satisfied smile, like he’d just communicate some sage wisdom.
“Now,” he said, “How do you like your burgeons?”
“Any way I can get them.”
Seb rolled his eyes at that, and he lolled his chin like he wanted to say something mean but stopped himself.
“You’re just like that Mazyd,” he said. “Can never answer a question straight.”
“I did answer it straight,” Mandri said. “I just don’t have a specific preference. I’ll take them crushed, boiled, stewed, crumbled in eggs, dripped over bacon, pressed into beer…”
“If you had to choose.”
“Well, one time I made a burgeon tea and the boofed it.”
“Boofed it?”
“Poured it into my ass.”
“That’s disgusting!”
“Actually, that’s probably the best way to do it. I wouldn’t call it my preference, but it is most efficient that way. You only need, like, a quarter of the usual amount to get the same effect if you boof it.”
“You are disgusting.”
“Why is this disgusting? It’s the way we were made. Solraheen didn’t put a second mouth inside our butts without a reason. You ever think of it like that? I mean, if I were designing human beings, I wouldn’t mix up the piping like that, but it is what it is.”
Seb continued to stare at Mandri with an ever-deepening frown. He didn’t say anything, though, and Mandri took that silence to mean acceptance. Begrudgingly given, but acceptance nonetheless.
Things are made to be used.
“It’s still disgusting,” Seb Said.
“I agree that it’s disgusting, but it is also an option. And honestly, you should seriously consider it. We’d have to make funnel of some kind… but think about it like this, we’re still nine days out from Ullr, and how long are those burgeons going to last us?”
“Us?” Seb asked accusingly.
“Well, okay, fine, how long will they last you?”
“This is God’s Eye, Mandri. It doesn’t take much to split open a stomach. Half a sliver of a stem would do it.”
Seb pulled a dagger from his waistband, scabbard and all, then leaned forward and removed the blade from it’s sheath.
“Hold out your hand,” He said.
“Why?”
“Just hold it out.”
Normal people don’t give their hands to a grungy man holding a blade. Mandri, in the state he was in, with those juicy burgeons just laying there on the flor, had no choice. He held out his hand, and Seb grabbed his wrist, then pushed it against the floor and stepped on it with his foot.
“We want to make sure none of it goes to waste,” he said.
He then put one of the burgeons in Mandri’s hand. It rolled around in his palm, and then settled onto his fingers.
Seb reached down and held the burgeon steady. The blade cut through it like wasn’t even there. Then Seb pulled away, pulled the burgeon away, and all that was left in mandri’s hand was a few dewy drops of a cloudy pale-green sap.
“That’s it?” Mandri asked.
Seb held the blade out towards Bandri. Stuck to it’s edge was a thin sliver of burgeon. Mandri peeled it off, and then popped it in his mouth and swallowed.
“The sap, too,” said Seb.
Mandri liked his fingers dry.
Then Seb whipped out a little glass bottle, plopped the bleeding burgeon into it, and then tucked it away.
Mandri eyed Seb with some suspicion. “You aren’t having any?” he asked.
“Sometimes, people have a bad reaction to God’s eye. It’s best if I play minder for a while.”
“I’ll be fine.”
“We’ll see.”
“I bet I’ve consumed more burgeons than any man alive.”
“Just sit back and watch the fire. We’ll know soon enough how you handle it.”
Mandri stared at the fire and waited for the burgeonsight to kick in. God’s eye burgeons should give him a god’s sight. Or were they called that because they were so round that they looked like eyes?
“How long is this going to take?”
“Varies. Depends on the person.”
“You know I wonder if the mazydai are affected by burgeons.”
“No idea.”
“You want to try? See what happens? Maybe it will help with the whole mind-control thing Purl’s working on. Soften him up.”
“I won’t waste a good God’s Eye on an evil creature like a Mazyd.”
“Evil?”
“Yes. Evil.”
“Doesn’t seem so evil to me.”
“Hah!”
“What?” 
“I’ve seen a Mazyd roast a child on a spit.”
“Riiiiight.”
“I saw it with my own damn eyes! It ran an iron shaft the width of my arm right through the little boy’s throat and… and then two smaller ones to pin the arms and legs.”
Seb screwed up his face as he said it, and his cheeks flushed, and his were nearly .
“Why would a Mazyd do that?” Mandri asked.
“Who can say but one who is evil? Can you think of a good, virtuous reason to do that? Try and make one up. I sure can’t.”
Mandri paused for a moment and pretended to think. He wanted to think of a reason, but the burgeon juice was starting to work its magic. The flames of the fire were starting to slow right down.
He so he just said, “Whatever.”
“Now hold on,” said Seb. “You do understand that the Mazydai are evil, right?”
“Yeah, sure, they’re evil.”
“Nah, nah, nah. No. You think that Mazydobo upstairs is good, don’t you!”
“No… Look, aren’t I allowed to reserve judgment? You say you’ve seen some things, I’ve seen other things, I mean I can only really go on my own experiences. I mean, Obo’s annoying as Shis, but eeeevil?”
“I’ve seen a Mazyd burn an entire nation to the ground.”
Mandri shrugged his shoulders.
“Don’t shrug your shoulders at that.”
“Oh, come on,” Mandri said. “You know what they say…”
“What do they say.”
“There’s always… two sides to every story.”
“Two sides!? TWO sides!? Tell me, what’s the other side to ten thousand people dying in a flash?”
“Ohhh, shit,” Mandri said, and he lay back on the ground.
“There’s an obvious evil staring you in the face, and you refuse to see it because of some stupid old rashsifim ajsdgu suj…”
Mandri could no longer make sense of Seb’s words. The rock walls were folding around him, stretching past him, and if he looked up at the soot-stained ceiling, he vivid sensation of falling upwards into it, imperceptibly at first, but soon enough the rock at the sides began to stretch, and the soot-stain began to congeal into a bottomless abyss. 
The strange thing about this whole experience was that the movement of the rock did not flow like in every other burgeon-sight, no elegant smoothing in and out, no sense of natural timing that one normally associates with God’s bush. It was like the he was being summoned up into the depths of the cosmos by some capricious deity who liked to play with his food before he ate it.
His limbs could sense movement, even though he knew there was none. There was a lightness in his chest, almost like his torso was in a perpetual state of being lifted off the ground. Mandri floated on the ground, and his mind was scrambling to keep an even keel, measuring out light years per second
Then came color, oozing out of the ceiling abyss like swirled ink, a dark and impenetrable blue, at first, then as the , it shifted through to purple and kept going, settled into a deep, suffocating Red. It wasn’t light, it was color given substance, and it flooded down onto Mandri, adhering to his skin, down onto the fire, sticking to the dancing flames, dampening their movement. 
Color continued to pour out the ceiling.
“Seb?” Mandri asked. There was no reply. The color poured down, filling out like a fog, until all edges seemed to merge into each other, and soon Mandri could not tell where his. He tried to hold focus by reading out the distance measurements from his console, committing them to memory - but the apparent melting of the display just magnified the sensation of his mind’s disassembly. 
Beyond this point, Mandri could not construct a coherent sequence of events. There were shapes, patterns, eyes. He’d slipped into an unfamiliar psychedelic trance in which static and moving things merged into a third state, the ___ in which the artificial construction of reality that occurs within the brain begins to atrophy. Mandri just sat there like a newborn, wide-eyed, a sense-organ with no memory, only .





Yes, my Lady.
It’s Pell! Dun, dun DUN!

Mention Seb’s quest for aurasight.

In the storm chapter, move the conversation about the Shiski and the traveler and the map shit to it.

‘Seen it amillion times. This man’s look. He’s no will to live.
Thats the burgeons he’s eaten. Sightless eyes. Man is high as the mountain.
Oh. But still.

I am more sanguine now.

Instead of recoiling at the sight of some physically or spiritually distasteful person, I now rejoice that but for some angelic grace that person could be me and in some distant way is me.

            <Text>Give woman a hair comb. 
‘Cant give that, you won’t have anything to hold up your hair.’
‘Oh no, what will I ever do.’
Seculla, pressentation matters.
Tis a new style. Pella, I just gave that woman ease of life for a year. All it cost me was the pain of having my hair touching my shoulders.
Pella takes off her comb and gives it to seculla.

Brains and beauty. Luckiest fuck. Both of you.
Your brother is not attractive.
That is precisely what makes him so lucky. He’s ugly as fuck and yet he’s got you.



Seculla grew up with nothing. When asked asked about her childhood she told people that she didn’t remember much about that time in her life. She’d say her memories as a little girl growing up in Hrk’s port city of Cask were just flashes, little vignettes of woe at the edges of things. Caskan children are always at the edges of things, soaking up the dark adumbrations that dribble off thicker hides, especially in the reed ghettos, where a naked woman sprinting through the street kicks up laughter instead of concern. Same goes for a bloody drunken brawl. One time Seculla watched two men beat the piss out of each other because they couldn’t agree on which one of them was better suited to take care of a shaggy brown dog. That drew belly laughs from everyone watching. That one was especially brutal because one of the men didn’t get back up. He was bald - a little bit of trivia that stayed sharp through the memory fuzz because that was the first time Seculla had ever seen blood come out of a skull. Blood from a skull is a bit darker, somehow, more syrupy. All thick and sticky. It seeped out of an invisible crack in the crown of that man’s head and it pooled on the ground under his ear. Seculla was five.
“I don’t remember much,” Seculla would sometimes say, though that wasn’t true. Seculla had an excellent memory. It was a bit blurry in places but she remembered all the key moments. She organized them all by theme: stories about loss, stories about hope, stories about oppression, and so on. 
Wht kind of freak categorizes her life like that? A politician does.  
For twenty-five years Seculla kept her stories clean and dusted for her summer tours. She knew that if you want to get elected to the Plenty then you’ve got to tell stories, personal stories especially. They’re so damned useful. If you want to get a person to vote for you, you’ve got to get them to believe in you. Tell them the right story about yourself and they will. Most of them will. Enough of them anyways.
There’s a secret to telling stories. That secret is a pillar of political rhetoric. It took Seculla a good decade and at least four weepy nights, sitting on a roof, wondering if she’d ever amount to anything in order to figure it out. The secret is a simple, one that every good politician knows but keeps close to the chest. It is this: people don’t really care about where she came from or why she was the person she was. They only cared to the extent they saw their own lives reflected in her. It wasn’t about her, it was about them. To get someone to believe in her, to vote for her, even to die for her, she had to tell them the right story about themselves. Then she had to give them something. Stories only go so far.
Tell a poor a story about why they’re poor and then you seal the deal with a gift of bread. Tell a rich a story about why they’re rich and then you give them, well, that’s a matter of statecraft. But the principle of the thing is always true. 
Some stories have universal rhetorical utility. She could tell them to rich and poor alike, and get value out all the same, even if for different reasons. Like that story about the brawl over the dog. It was a good one. It resonated with the poor because it showed how the fringes of Hrkan society was so strung out and isolating that men would kill each other for just a little bit of animal kinship. The rich liked it because the setting was a place devoid of Sol’s light, and the poor, the unscrubbed, their killing, their drink, their death, well they’re doing it all to themselves, aren’t they? 
All this extra commentary goes unspoken, of course. If anyone ever asked Seculla what one of her stories meant, or even if there was a meaning, well she knew better than to get in her own way. When she told stories she stuck to the raw events. That’s how she mobilized people. She didn’t get there through heady logic and reason or facts and figures. She got under the skin, curdled the blood, and made a man’s bone marrow tingle so that he couldn’t sit still unless he got up and did something about it.
One story above all others held special significance for Seculla. It was the story of how she and her mother came to Hrk. She didn’t like sharing it because it was too foundational, gave people too firm a grip on her as a person. Pella was trying to convince her to bring it out. Pella was her friend, her strategist, and her sister-in-law all wrapped in up into one thin, bookish woman. The two of them were sitting in private horse-drawn carriage that rumbled down the Hrk’s Grand Boulevard. They were headed towards the House of Plenty where Seculla was due for a reckoning. Pella thought the story would help.
“It’s obvious what they’re going to do,” Pella said. She was busy draining blood from a bowl of dead cobbeetles into a long-necked green glass bottle. The deep red blood was to be the coloring for Seculla’s lipstick. The jostling carriage made this process more difficult than usual. It was too bad they were in such a rush.
“You think today’s the day they try it?” Seculla asked.
Pella looked up and said, “What else could it be about? It’s the obvious play. You technically aren’t a member of the Plenty.”
Seculla said, “By rights I should Head of the Plenty. You know they’re saying I got more votes than the next three electors combined.”
“And they’re going to point out that it’s you’re husband that got those votes. Yes, I know, a vote for your husband is a vote for you, but the Body of the Plenty is going to try to end this bait and switch. They’re going to demand that Danserd shows up instead of you or they’ll call a vote and try to remove his seat.”
“My seat.”
“Everyone knows its your seat. The point is that they’ll charge Danserd on grounds of dereliction. I mean you’ve heard the arguments in the street already.”
“Yes, I’ve heard.”
“They’re saying the wife consolt fill in was never intended to be a permane-”
“I said I’d heard. God. It doesn’t matter. They’re not stupid enough to go through with it.”
Pella smiled. “Seculla, if there’s one thing I’ve learned from growing up around my father and his friends, it’s to never underestimate the greed, the hubris, and the self-importance of a politician.” 
 Seculla returned an irritated glare through half-lidded eyes. Pella was the only person she’d let off after a friendly rib. 
“Oh please,” Pella said. “You’re all selfish degenerates by nature, and you know it.”
“Why can’t we do what we did last time?”
“You mean bring Danserd in for a day?”
“Yeah. Have Danserd drink his brew and get all sweaty and then march him right into Plenty to prove he’s sick.”
“That won’t work because this session wasn’t called by the Head of Plenty. It’s the Mazydoro who called it. There’ll be a judgment.”
“Who told you that?”
“No one. It’s the only thing that makes sense. The only way they’d have the balls to do this is if they knew we couldn’t bog them down in technicalities.”
“Damn.”
“You need to make it about you. Not Danserd. It’s your seat after all. Everyone knows it. The people vote for you, not Danserd. Make it about you. And listen, you have got to play up the immigrant aspect. You’re not a woman, you’re an immigrant. Half the Plenty is immigrants. All of Hrk is obsessed with immigrants. It’s the living proof that Sol’s light shines on this city. You are the living proof. That’s our angle.” 
“You’re bleeding.”
Pella looked down to see she’d poured a little bug-blood into her lap. 
“Ah, shit. You get what I mean, though, right?”
Of course Seculla understood. If there’s one thing all of Hrk loves, especially the privileged class, it’s the story of an immigrant paddling up the Hrk and coming into the city’s embrace. Hrkans have an old word for this event: ‘Soliriklr’. It means something like, ‘Sol’s light scrubbing off the filth’. It’s accompanied by a particular sting of enlightenment. 
The journey, or the story, always starts the same, with incredulity. People who have never been to Hrk don’t see what the big deal is. To them, Hrkans are a conceited bunch, prone to exaggeration. They’re always talking about the city, playing the place up; the temples everywhere, the people everywhere, the food, the wine, the wealth, the sheer size of it. They don’t shut up about it. It’s always, “like we do in Hrk,” or “wouldn’t pass in Hrk,” or “you’d love it in Hrk”. “Hrk, Hrk, Hrk”. It’s like a cat coughing up a hairball. They get so annoying that all along the Strait there’s a vibrant black-market trade in stories of Hrkkan depravity, because if you spend an evening at a tavern chatting up a Hrk, you’ve got to balance out the humors with something dark.
When Seculla was a girl in Cask, she didn’t have to look hard for reasons to hate the Hrks. Outside looking in, that might seem odd, since Cask sat at the mouth of the Hrk river. One would imagine that Hrk’s port city would be rich, and young Seculla would be swimming in luxury. But everything good filtered right through it, and that was real, real easy to get upset about.
Seculla would speak of one sunny day when she was about seven. Her father was still asleep from a three-day bender and her mother had been off with the boats around the horn, so poor Seculla hadn’t eaten anything other than bug-butts for days. She was starving. She remembered standing knee deep in the still water of a tidal pool, and through the reeds she spied a tide of barges floating right on by. The long platforms of these barges were packed tight with ox-sized canvas bags that were each filled to nearly bursting with grain. None of the boats were stopping. She was standing there, poor little girl, hungrier than she’d ever been, and food enough for all of Cask five times over was right there, swimming away from her. To top it off, the bargemen’s sticks were dipping in time to the rhythm of a haughty work-song that sang of wives, thighs, and mistresses playing hard to get. The throaty refrain was all about what the men would do to the girls once they caught them. 
Now this story-to-set-up-the-story wasn’t, strictly speaking, true. Seculla had finessed the details, which themselves were mostly true, only they weren’t so intimately connected. Seculla’s father was a drunk. Her mother did go off for days to chase shoals of mackerel around the horn. Seculla had spent plenty of time alone with hunger, and she ate bug-butts and played in tidal pools. The song about chasing women was a popular one. The grain barges floating by where a regular sight in early autumn. The only real lie here was that there was always a little something on the barges for Seculla and her family. It was never enough, though, only a half empty-sack the size of Seculla herself, enough grain to last the family a couple of weeks. Even if they had the money they weren’t allowed to buy any more than that. So Seculla didn’t think of it as lying. 
The furthest she was willing to go was to say she was ‘stretching the truth’, but even that felt like pulling a tooth. She’d take up arms if someone called it a ‘white lie’. This compact little narrative that she’d created, the way that it condemned the ruthless efficiency with which Hrk sucked all wealth towards its administrative center, it was no lie. It was, in her own words, a “sum of truths, and so it is truer than true”. Stacking isolated truths atop each-other like that, a cruel pastiche of callous indifference, it showed a larger truth with a clarity that was impossible to ignore. The most shrewd rhetorician in all the Plenty couldn’t dance around it. Hrk, despite its glory, despite it’s special dispensation handed down to it’s royal family, handed down by Sol Himself when He still walked the earth, Hrk the great city at the center of civilization, this Hrk had lost its way. 
 Then her father died. This was a regular truth that had no deeper meaning. It was a mere happening, not important at all to the bigger picture. Sometimes Seculla skipped over the telling of it. She’d say, “Then my mother ran into a bit of bad business. She had to sell everything. There was only enough left over to buy two spots on a slave barge, for me and her, and then off we went up river.”
From Cask, it takes five days to get to the Hrkkan outlands. Most of this way is wetlands. It’s not a single self-contained river that’s easy to follow, it’s a river delta infested with tidegrass. It is easy to get lost out there if one strays from the congested center thoroughfare with its stream of rowboats, stickboats, and barges. For little Seculla it was as boring a place as could be, because tidegrass is six feet tall and blocks the view, and for those five days in the delta there’s nothing but rank upon rank of tidegrass in every direction. 
The tidegrass blocked the wind, too, so things got sweaty as soon as the sun came up. The slave barge had a wide, canvas sunshade suspended overhead, but that did little to protect against the heat. Going for a swim did nothing because the shallow, slow moving water in the delta felt like a 
On the third day in the delta, two slaves on the barge died. As Seculla told it, they died from neglect. There was enough clean water on-board for everyone. These two poor souls weren’t allowed a drink because the fat, scruffy slaver who owned the boat wouldn’t let them, and he was the kind of short-tempered squabbler who brooked no argument. He said the two old men wouldn’t fetch a penny, and he swore that he would toss anyone overboard who disagreed with him on that. When Seculla tried to give the poor wretches water behind his back, she was stopped by the only caring adult Seculla had ever known: her mother. 
Now, this part of the story never happened. Slaves didn’t actually die on-board Seculla’s boat. In fact, Seculla and her mother had smuggled themselves atop a troop transport, not a slaver’s barge. The death of those two slaves was another bit of “truer than true” fantasy. No one ever doubted it because slaves did die on route to Hrk, and dying from overheat is hardly the worst way they go. It’s not uncommon to see a grubbed up corpse with a branded belly tangled amongst the reeds.
What was important was that this bit of truth, this ‘truer than true’ truth, it explained how Hrk managed to get away with pilfering the wealth of the world: it was through fear, fear conquering compassion. When Seculla told this story, she was careful to craft it in such a way that people didn’t get angry at the slaver; the slaver, his malice, that was a common evil, and such baseness is written into the fabric of Life by Sol’s dark brother. No, Seculla wanted the people angry at her mother for capitulating to him. To this end Seculla dwelled  on the stress and shame in her mothers eyes as she held back Seculla’s helping hand - an expressionless face not daring to pretend . 
The believability of it all was kept steady by the skill with which Seculla padded out the scene with familiar details. The tidegrass was an important note. Tidegrass everywhere. Tidegrass with their stiff stems all dusted in brown silt which marked the high point of the tide. She’d remark on the little white snails that clung to them for dear life, and smile out at the audience and they’d smile back because they’d remembered them too. And the color is unforgettable, vibrant color, how the brown of the stalk shifts into into yellow above the waterline, then shifts again into a healthy, leafy green. And inside the bunches of tidegrass are the bird nests that can’t be seen. Seculla knew they were there because whenever the barge approached too close to a bunch of tidegrass a frightening squawk would blurt out. It was a call of warning. Then another nesting bird some ways away would pick up the call and squawk in response, and then that call would echo out, and then a more distant bird picked it up, kept it up, and then another, then another, and on and on until the siren sound wore itself out somewhere in the infinite distance.
Twice a day the tide went out and whatever waterway the barge was in would be reduced to a mud flat. With the river bottom exposed the life under the water was revealed: shoals of oysters, black crabs scuttling from hole to hole, mudkips trudging through the muck and into the shade of the reeds. Not all the water was gone. In the middle of this tidal mud plain there was still a thin, silver ribbon of water winding its way towards the sea. This was the Rivgula - the ‘River Under the River’, and it played a critical role in Hrkkan mythology. It is a story that every Hrkan knows. 
Back when Sol walked the earth, he told Saulistides, founder of Hrk’s royal line, to follow the River Under the River to its source. Saulistides followed it, and it led it him safely through the delta. Back then, the unfamiliar journey took twelve days, and this was a time of great drought, so it was walked, not paddled, and it wasn’t just the delta that was drained, the river proper had been reduced to a trickle. All this meant that Saulistedes could follow the Rivgula with ease, even as it led out of the river bed. He followed it inland for a mile where he discovered an eternal spring, and there, with Sol’s guidance, he founded the city of Hrk.
Even now, the Rivgula still flows. And this was true. True in the regular sense, but also ‘truer than true’ sense, because despite the erosion of justice, fairness, tolerance, and pity, the city of Hrk was still Sol’s chosen.
The Outlands begin when the reeds give way to solid land and all the many distributaries of the Hrk converge into single whole. There’s a clearly defined riverbank and it’s edged with cypress trees and cicada shrills. The outland beyond the bank is grassland, grazing land, with barely a person or structure, but there is plenty of cattle. Seculla smelled the beasts long before she ever saw them, for the wind was in her face and it blew the bewildering stench of manure up into her nose whether she liked it or not. For a while she breathed through her mouth but as the boat drew nearer the herds the stench grew so pungent that it seemed as if she could taste it. 
This was the first sign of the impossible scale of Hrkan civilization, that she could smell the cattle miles before seeing them. Then she could hear them - at first it was nothing but a faint hum in the atmosphere. She asked a bargeman what that odd noise was, and the man looked at her like she was dumb. He said, “Just wait and see.” A full hand later and the sound was loud enough locate; just beyond a shrubby hill. And that sound was more than mooing. It was the thunder of an army on march. A cloud of dust rose into the air. The water quaked. 
Then the barge floated around a tight river bend and suddenly, there the cattle were, arrayed all along the countryside, number beyond counting. There were so many that it wasn’t a march of beasts so much as it was a storm of them, a single fluid mass that undulated around rock and tree and sent out arms to every nook and cranny where shrubbush likely grew. The cattle formed a living whole, a creature greater than the sum of its parts, with its own logic, its own smell, its own rumbling growl. Seculla’s eyes watered up in amazement.
The bargeman caught her gaping. He quipped, “Just wait until we get to the corrals.”
This part of Seculla’s Hrkan journey happened exactly how she told it. There was no fiddling with the truth of the outland herds because within any captive audience there is always a few who will speak up if she’d say anything different, for everyone sees the herds the same. It didn’t matter who she was or where she came from or what she believed about Hrk, its wealth or its excess, everyone sees the herds the same. The sight, the sound, the smell - the gestalt of sense-experience overwhelms the narrative self and electrifies the soul. To make it seem like it wasn’t so great or if she tried to downplay the management capabilities of the Mazydoro, well it wasn’t impossible to do, it just only really worked in a private setting where Seculla could tailor her  conversational control.
There was a lesson in this story of herd. It wasn’t a profound lesson, but it was a truer-truth. The lesson was this: the shortest route to someone’s soul is through the senses, through sight and smell and sound. Seculla could spend a lifetime trying to get a gaggle of generals to follow her by crafting the right story or speech with meticulous care, but why bother with the effort when the right perfume could do the trick?
Of course, Seculla did both, because why not? Everything can always be better. Nonetheless, sensation was the foundation. For it wasn’t words that triggered in little Seculla that sense of awe at the outland herds. It was the smell of gas and manure, and how it stayed on her clothes even after they’d drifted upwind. It was the sight of the unbridled mass. It was the sound of thunder jumbling her bones.
The key for Seculla in her age of political largess was to find the right arrangement of dress, makeup, perfume, and carriage that would transform her into something more than human. She was naturally beautiful so the effort easy. She was slender, with long dark hair, piercing blue eyes, and brows that gave her face a hawkish look. She had her own perfumer, a man she’d found shilling flower salts in cheapside, and this man understood her wants exactly: fragrances that were barely there but had reach and lingered.
When giving speeches to the House of Plenty, Seculla would step off the central lectern, walk around the Plenty circle, and let the all the men take in her beauty and aroma as she chastised them for their greed. Stepping off the lectern to speak had never been done before. It caused an outburst the first time she did it, but there weren’t any rules against it. In time others did it too, first as a joke, a ‘parody of Seculla’s feminine wiles’, but then it became commonplace. Whenever another member of the Plenty would circulate the room, Seculla would smile to herself, because these men had know idea why she would leave the lectern to speak. They thought it was some performative trick, that perhaps the act of moving around added energy and gusto and certainty to words coming out of her belly - and it did, a little, but mostly it was about the sensation of the her, of Seculla the Divine, and when these men walked the circle they smelled like sweat and molasses. The old ones were the worst. She had to stop a few members of her own party from doing it. They had no appreciation for how smell helps to define a creature. That conscious thought had just never entered their heads. That’s who she was dealing with.
Now, the outlands are so extensive that it takes four more days of barging upriver for the pasture to give way to a vast network of irrigation canals. This place is called the farmlands, for the land is flat and fertile and it’s gridded up by right-angled roads. Square plots of variegated crops radiate out into the distance, quilting the surface of the earth for as far as Seculla’s eye could see. Mostly it was wheat and barley for bread and drink, and browngrass that can be pulped and processed into shiny textiles. The rest was filled with all manner of plants that Seculla had never seen, and all of them had tall, leafy stalks and grew as thick as mat of .
There were little cities scattered throughout this countryside. The bargemen called them ‘villages’, but some of their thatched halls and windmill towers were bigger than any in Cask. If Cask was a city then those were cities. There weren’t enough of them, though. Little Seculla doubted there’d be enough people in all the world to reap this harvest. And this was just the southern quarter. This farmland, Seculla was told, goes on and on and it circles around the City Proper (which can’t even be seen yet). The Hrkan world is so big that the land up north is so far away that it sits in a different clime. It’s rain-watered land, wet enough for trees and fruiting bodies and thirsty nuts and giant tuberous roots. 
It was an incredible claim and Seculla’s knee-jerk reaction was to doubt it as just another Hrkan hyperbole. Then the bargeman told her that it would take another four days to reach Hrk’s southern wall. That’s four days of farmland, four days of cities radiating out from the river. How many cities in all? The bargemen said more than twenty. How is this possible? By the light of Sol, by the power of the King, and by the wisdom of the Mazydoro.
Four days later she came to the City Proper. Hrk, the city of stone and monuments, ringed by Pilstedes’ Wall, which is six feet thick, twenty feet high. If its stones were piled together it would be its own mountain. It sits on the horizon like a and it circles the entire city.  but that seems hard to believe, because 



It’s impossible to overstate how daunting the wall is for a newcomer who is piddling up the river. Because the earth here is flat you can spy the wall from a good ways off. 
It’s two days from the edge of the farmlands to the edge of the city proper, which is marked by Pilstedes’ Wall. The wall is made from granite blocks were quarried from exposed bedrock in distant north. The grey stone seems out of place amidst the reeds and mud. And the thing is 


Seculla was born in the poorer part of Cask, which was itself the poorer part of the river Hrk. As a port city it shouldn’t have been poor, but Cask was Hrk’s port city, and Hrk proper has a way sucking all the world’s wealth towards its administrative center with ruthless efficiency.

This wasn’t always the case. There was a time, decades before Seculla, when Caskans could carve out a little something for themselves. The world was smaller then and Cask’s boatmen and farmers didn’t have to compete with anyone else. Then Hrk exploded out of its borders, and when Hrkkan armies embarked from Cask and crossed the Strait they took Hrkkan markets with them. Dried fish and grain were shipped back in incredible quantities. Prices for local Caskan harvests were driven down into the dirt. Common folk couldn’t break even. Then came the slaves of war, the free labor, and as a consequence, only the elite could get by. Most everyone else in Cask sold their lands, or sold their own freedom, or tried to outrun their debts by fleeing. They fled north east into the Uher valley, or fled across the water and settled down into the Sand.
For example, one story she’d often tell to eager partisans as arrayed before her was one that played nicely with . 


 The story of Hrk that stayed with Seculla, when she was a child in Cask, was the story of the Shiviti road. There once was a road that connected the sprawling city of Hrk to Cask. The road’s purpose was to be a straight line alternative to the river, which took five days by barge to get from the coast to Hrk’s outlands. The river curls up on itself so often that the mileage is more than doubled. 
At this time there was a new crop berry called fushberry, and it only grew on the hills of northern Jandria, just across the strait. The fushberry bush sent it’s fruits out right after the summer Shisl rains, so it was hot, and the berry only kept fresh, for at most, a week.
That straight-line road was short lived because the land south of the outland was a grassy marsh. Hrkkan engineers thought they could overcome it. They were a hydraulic civilization, centuries old, and figured they knew how to tame the elements. They built a mound of stone, gravel, and clay  The problem was that  because to maintain the road the Hrkkans had to maintain the long, winding mound it was built on, and that kept getting washed out by flooding.  The thing gets washed out and muddied. The stones laid down disappear under layers of mud or get washed way altogether when monsoons come. If
It’s a tale of hubris and excess. Foreigners make fun. They wonder what kind of nation of idiots would dream to cut through marsh like that, tame Nature. THat is, until they make journey up the Hrk for themselves and see the scale of the Hrkkans have done.</Text>

Birds diving down.
Sharks come up - scales flying out of gills
Ends when a massive whale comes out of the deep.

That climb was supposed to go. 

I was trying to explain what I look for when looking for caves the other day. It’s been over 100degrees here for 2 weeks. Today it’s 72 and the plumes of steam are a good indicator of caves. Not always but sometimes.

Odd thing was, this time she wasn’t in it for herself. She was acting on behalf of some interested third party. Who that was, Mandri couldn’t figure, but Mandri was drunk, so he had a hard enough time figuring out how to keep the spit from dribbling out of his mouth when he talked. 

Quit larging it.

Mandrameen bit into another potsticker. He savored the sweet peach sauce in which the shredded chicken had been baked.

Wants the darkblade - will turn him into powerful demon
Keep it from him
Deceitful demon. 
Realization that only wy to close demon portal is to give darkblade to malus.

I think you need to reevaluate the role of the word belief when it comes to the salvation of the soul. I believe in the sun rising. That doesnt bring about any internal change in me. Belief is not tied to internal change. To become a christian, you must first kill yourself. Belief is necessary but not sufficient.

            <Text>
The woman has powers over life and death and you think Ayram is the leader here?

The Great Library of Jeket has a map of Shis. Mandri saw it when he was five. He asked his dad what it was, and the old man told him straight, “That is a map of Shis. It isn’t real.”
“Why isn’t it real?” Mandri asked.
“Think about it Mandri… No one goes to Shis and comes back, least of all a scribe capable of making maps. It’s just a fantasy.”
That map hung on the second floor of the eastern wing of library, and it was a sprawling of ink on goat skin, shaped like a puddle of spilled milk, roughly two-men long and one-and-half high. It occupied a privileged position in Mandri’s imagination. He’d steal away from his master-copies to marvel at all the fantastic detail, for the map wasn’t merely lines and , it was crawling with demons and , all manner of fantastic beasts. Men with chicken heads and chicken feet, chickens with lizard arms and phallic extrusions instead of claws. There were regular human too, represented by stick figures, and the demons were tormenting them with whips and chains. Instead of boring, like Bobbby mountains, Jek river, and boring, like Meskalem, this map had Shusa, or, “The Plain of Woe”, Kikarukabam, “Where adulterers are flensed,” and Zuudramu, “Apostasy Pits”.
For brief period of time, about a month or two when he was fifteen, Mandrameen became so obsessed with Shis that he began to question the nature of it. This obsession started when he learned that the maker of the map was an ancient scribe by the name of Batata, and Batata was the most famous explorer of those ancient days when Jandri was largely unknown to the Hrkan world. Batata had written five books that detail his journey’s, and in all accounts his word was truth. Scribes in the centuries previous had argued about which way the Shurka river flowed, and Batata settled that - he said it flowed east, and indeed it did. Batata won a grand sum for the discovery of the location of Kurbaku. That sum had been set by some early Hrkan Lord, with the intention of opening up trade with that fabled city flush with gold. When Batata found it, he said that Kurbaku was little more than a dump of mud brick huts. There was almost no gold, and even less hospitality. His revelation caused a stir amongst the scribes and merchants, and many didn’t believe him, they didn’t want to believe him. He was under great professional pressure to admit he was lying, but yet again, he was proved true - Kurbaku was several centuries removed from it’s golden apogee.
So why would Batata lie about Shis?
The scribal consensus surrounding his map of Shis was that Batata had made the map to scare common folk into virtue. They claimed that Batata was a scribe himself, and as such, he’d dedicated himself to the furtherance of Solraheen’s kingdom, and scare tactics were common to scribes and priests of those ancient days. It was part of an Old Jandri creed, often written on the tombs of long-dead kings who didn’t have the Mazydai to keep the social order: Justice without virtue is blind, virtue without terror is impotent. People have got to be scared or else they’ll loosen their lips, loosen their hips, and start stabbing at anything that walks.
Mandri’s estimation was that this explanation of the map’s purpose was workable, but not reasonable. He thought Batata was, like himself, a man of integrity who put great care into his work, not the kind of person to let a spiritual scare tactic sully his more serious work. It’d be one thing to have fun aside, but in all of Batata’s serious maps which outlined Jandria’s true shape, there were always a few small dots creeping out in the void the Sand like spiders, each with a postscript saying, Shiskason, or, “Entrance into Shis.”
These dots were so far out into the desert, and so far away from any road, that no rational person would try and verify their truth. Batata himself said that these dots were just approximations, and that he had only stumbled onto these “gashes in the earth” by pure happenstance - as they’re not things that can be seen from a distance.
There is one moth-eaten scroll where Batata accounts his descent into one of these ‘gashes’, and from this journey he gained the knowledge of Shis’s outlay. It is a poetic work, without much poetic value, as it was written in a mind-numbing meter which was the style for the more narrative works of the day. Even if half its lines weren’t eaten away, Mandri wouldn’t have , .Yet, there was one refrain, however, that stuck with him over the years.
Batata recounted how he’d been stumbling through the pitch black, torch in hand, and the first sing of Shis was a massive stone gate, tall and narrow, a horizontal mantelpiece supported by perfectly plumb and squared beams. Engraved into these pillars was a ancient creed, and hereafter Batata it became known as the creed of Schisol. It rhymes in Old Jandri, but written out in common, it reads:

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth. 
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right.
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be made immortal.

That last line was something else. Do not live… Mandri supposed its meaning was lost in translation. He wasn’t the only one who felt that way. Scribes argued about everything that has the remotest theological significance, and so the meaning of this creed .
The Schisolitant were a death cult. That was the point of departure. From there, there was an absurd number of interpretations. Most prominent, of course, was that Batata had made it all up. Of those who took it seriously, most thought the creed was a set of instructions meant to be remanded into the head through repetition. They claimed that one of the requirements for entering Shis was to bring other people along, lead them to the slaughter, a sign of dedication to the ultimate goal in Schisol’s corrupted theology: the eradication of all life.
Some thought that Batata had mistranscribed the last line. They thought it should be Do not eat instead of Do not live, in keeping with the Schisolun’s belief that the stomach’s magic could be sustained through breath of Schisol alone.
Unfortunately, Mandri knew the truth.
He’d followed the Ayramun down into the dark passages of the earth. No doubt one of Batata’s ‘gashes’. It was a meandering maze of rock and black abysses, and Mandri felt like they weren’t alone, that these black tunnels might, if he were to breathe too loudly, vomit out teeth and demons. So, he kept on in silence, quiet as the little lizards that scurried in and out of cracks in the floor, and he cridged every time one of the other Ayramun made a noise. One time they .
After that, they came to a gate.
A tall, narrow, rectangular stone gate, with perfectly plumb and squared columns hewn from the rock. Graven into posts was Schisol’s creed.
The last line read, Do not live.
Now, Affirming Batata’s account of the gate of Shis wasn’t in, but it was a bright little revelation wrapped in the dark. He was more concerned, however, with how Ayram and Moto had passed casually underneath it. He was next in line.
Willingly walk into Shis?
Not a chance.
He paused. Elrahet, and Purl brushed past him.
Moteah was next, and as she went, she said, “Try and keep up.”
“I’ll be right behind,” Mandri said. “I just need a quick breather.”
Moteah kept on marching, and when Mandri lost sight of light of her torch, he dared a whisper to MazydObo behind him.
“Obo,” he said.
“What?”
“I think we’re in Shis.”
“We’re not in Shis,” Obo said with a groan.
Mandri waved the torch over the graven letters in the rock. “Do you see this?”
“I’m on your back, you idiot. I can’t see anything.”
“Oh, right.”
Mandri turned around to give Obo a chance to look.
“Hold up the torch,” Obo said.
“Right, sorry.”
Mandri held up the torch, and a moment later he heard Obo give a curious, “Hmmm, interesting.”
“What’s interesting?”
“This is Schisol’s creed,” Obo said. He said it with such passivity that.
“That means we’re in Shis, doesn’t it?”
“Mandri, Shis exists on a different plane of reality. It is not a thing made of rock and stone that can be touched.”
Mandri spun back around to get another look. “Then what is this?” He heard Obo a frustrated sigh, but didn’t care, .
Obo said, “Shis is not a real place, but Schisol himself, as far as can be attested, was real. The Schisolitant were real, and according to all sources, they were once ascendant in this world. They built cities. Presumably, they built tunnels too, like this one.”
“Yeah but… don’t you find this all too strange?”
“We should be keeping pace with the others.”
“I’m not sure if we should. Ayram’s casually strolling into Schisol’s tunnel-work, and what are we doing? Following him down into the depths like we’re sheep for the slaughter. You know, the scribes say that’s what the Schisolitant did, you know. They’d gather up the penitent, and then lead them down into the bowels of the earth and offer them up as sacrifices. And look what Ayram’s doing.”
“I don’t think Ayram is a Schisolitant.”
“He is trying to kill Solraheen.”
“Yes, that is a curious interest… but there’s certain confounding depth to current events that has me hesitant to draw any conclusions. I suggest we keep moving.”
“You’re welcome to go. I, however, will move when I’m good and ready.” Mandri stares at the letters and tried to decipher their age. He didn’t know a thing about how to do that, but it didn’t stop him from trying. There was a layer of dust in the grooves. How many years is a layer of dust?
“Mandri, if the Ayramun take a turn and you’re not there to see it, do you think you could follow them?”
“I’m sure you could, right?”
“Well! I’m happy to hear you’ve placed your trust in me.”
Just then, Moteah’s voice came echoing and re-echoing out of the tunnel ahead.
“MANDRI-andri-andri!”
Mandri shouted back.
“Coming-oming-oming.”
And he set off he went. 
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that gate made little effort to tame its passage, save for a few carven steps which wound down the steeper drops, as well as a few cutout handholds in places where the path ran across narrow ledges that overlooked a yawing fissure.
In other sections, the rock was halfway near swallowing them up. In places, the walls were so narrow that it was impossible to face straight ahead, so Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways, dragging Obo behind like a stubborn dog. He got to thinking, when both his belly and his back were scraping along, that it wouldn’t take much to squish him like a bug.
At the first fork in the path, Elrahet took the lead. She walked with purpose, as she always did, and when there were more forks, she had no hesitation, she charged ahead, and at every turn Mandri expected to be confronted by gaping chasm or impassible slump of boulders, but there never were.
Mandri got the sense that Elrahet knew the way a little too well. Even if this wasn’t Shis itself, it was made by Schisol’s believers. Who, then was Elrahet? What the fuck was he doing, just following her?
These thoughts plagued Mandrameen for the entire strenuous hike, and they came to a head when the Ayramun bunched up at the edge of one particularly jagged rent in the earth, a bottomless abyss. The path across was naught but a footwide ledge of rock that spanned the distance, which was as long as ten men. There were no handholds in the wall, yet one by one the Ayramun shimmied across. Ayram himself made several trips, ferrying everyone’s pack, including Obo.
When it was Mandri’s turn to go, he found that his knees had locked and his pits were sweating like he , all this despite the chill that hung in the air.
Ayram slapped Mandri’s back, and then 
“Time to go,” he said. Such was Ayram’s voice that even if he whispered in this place, his words would echo with the same clarity as Mandri’s shout.
Mandri looked at the ledge as it flickered in the torchlight. It was barely there.
“Come on, now,” said Ayram.
Mandri handed his torch to Ayram, then turned to face the rock and began his shimmy across the gap.

A rock broke out from under Mandri’s foot. He gave a yelp, then then watched the rock fall into the darkness. He didn’t lose his balance, and he made it across without further incident.
“This is bullllll-shit,” he declared after. 
The rock he’d kicked out into the abyss sent him a retort.
 A stupefying, distant BOOM echoed up from the hidden depths where the rock had smacked the bottom. To Mandri it seemed like an age ago. He hid his terror with a laugh.

That was the peak of his . There wasn’t much time to really stop and think as Elrahet led them on through an increasingly tight winding of ceilingless fissures and low-hung corridors. At times they had to literally crawl through tubes, and the moment he’d set his clammy hand against the rock he shocked with cold. The air was cold but Mandri’s woolen robe blunted it’s chill of the rock, the rock, though, it was ice-cold, but at this depth the rock was damp, and where. 
Mandri’s robe was much worse for wear every time he stumbled to his feet. His torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable; hidden edges and shadowed protrusions ripped into the woolen threads, and if Mandri wasn’t careful as he scraped along, he’d cut his flesh as well. Obo? Well, no doubt Obo bore the worst of it, but for Mandri he was out of sight, out of mind - save for the whispered curses.
Time was difficult to track in the dark. Mandri measured it with his legs, if they were a little weary, that meant he’d marching for a few hours. The first painful twinge in his calf marked a few hours more. Once the unremitting burn set into his thighs and buttocks, well that marked a full days journey. It was an accurate system, or so Mandri believed, because every time hes legs went through it, right up to the point where he’d had enough, the Ayramun stopped, Ayram pulled out some thin sticks to  to make small fire and rest. They rested only as long as the twigs lasted. How long that was, Mandri was sure. It wasn’t long enough. After the second rest like this Mandri’s system of measurement was broke, because when he started out again, his legs were already sore. 
 It wasn’t until the fourth march that Mandri’s shoes slapped onto paved stone. His feet were so used to little bumps that threatened to puncture through his leather soles that the feeling of flatness caught him by surprise, and it was flat as could be, flat as a screeded sand. Mandri looked down to see a quarter-square of tiling. Engraved along it’s border was a jagged line of nested Zs. Mandri wondered how it’d gotten there, and a moment later and he had his answer, for he followed Elrahet into a cavern the size of one of Soldgi’s dunes. Set in the far wall of this cavern was a giant stone double-door, twice the height of Ayram, and the entire floor of this cavern was covered in tiles decorated like the one he’d seen.
The Ayramun marched right across these tiles, heels clacking and shuffling, and when they got to the doors, Ayram called for a break. 
Mandri was happy to sit, though he didn’t like sitting so near that massive double-door. It’s size and mystery was imposing enough, and on top that it was an incredible work of art, yet grotesque in the extreme. Every inch of either panel were carved with figures, demonic figures from which which Batata had likely drawn inspiration, only they looked so much more real when rendered in stone, and instead of whipping stick-figured humans, they were doing things unmentionable to figures fully fleshed.
Set atop the door’s inset frame was a human head the size of Solraheen’s, a male head, bald like Obo’s, and that’s when Mandri noticed that the door-frame itself were sculpted in the shape of arms, and these long and spindly things stretched down to the flour, where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
Mandrameen had no doubt - this was the gate of Shis.
It was Shis because it hadn’t been marked up. If it were simply an ancient city, then those doors, and figure-work that fine would have been marked up ages ago, for that was the inevitable fate of all art ancient and abandoned - some treasure hunter or ne’er-do-well will come along and mark it up.
And here he was, sitting in front of it, watching a giant man spark up a fire.
The two men try to open it, give up.

Said out loud, “What are we doing here?”
Seb picked it up, and said, “What are you doing here?”
Purl said, “Oh, come off it, Seb.” 
“What?” Seb said defensively, “I’m just asking for some clarification. This isn’t a place for the 
Purl said, “We’re not going to leave him down here.”
“What’s his purpose? He is no Ayramun.”
Obo was sat next to Mandri, resting against someone’s back, and he spoke up in Mandri’s defense, saying, “Mandri is my legs.”
Sob snorted, then said, “I could carry you.”
“But I don’t want you to carry me.”
“Why?”
“Because I don’t like you.”
Purl laughed and Seb shook his head. Then he rubbed his hands then held them close to the flames. The fire was putting out enough light that Mandri could see his own breath come out as steam.
Seb said to Obo, “What if Mandri dies? Then you won’t have a choice as to who carries you.” There was an undeniable venom in the way Seb spoke of Mandri’s death. The man was dipping his toes in a threat.
“If Mandri dies,” Obo said, “then I’m going to kill you.”
Seb brows went cross and then he buried chin in his neck.
“I didn’t say I was going to kill him. People die. That’s what we do. Especially down here, that’s what this place is made for.”
Seb eyed the doors and blew into his fists to warm them up.
“What is this place?” Obo asked.
It was Mandri who answered. “It is Shis.”
“It’s not Shis,” said Obo. “Like I said earlier, Shis is not a physical place. It is a spiritual one.”
Elrahet, who’d been sitting across the fire, spoke for the first time.
“But it is Shis,” she said, voice growling. The crackle of the flames accented her speech, such that. 
Obo was undeterred. “You call it Shis, sure, but that’s not what Mandri means when he says, ‘Shis’. What he is referring to, what the Hrkan world up above is referring to when they speak the name, is a place of spiritual torment.”
Elrahet pointed to the demon doors with a knobby finger. “Shis,” she said, “is just beyond those slabs of stone.”
“Yes, a physical place, taken the namesake in fit of terror, but decidedly not the place where Sparks are purified in flames.”
Elrahet  “So many books in Jeket and somehow you’re unlearned.”
“What do you mean?”
“You have the source and its derivative the wrong way ‘round. This place is older than the sermons of Solitant priests. This place came first. This is the real Shis, and it’s not the Spark they tortured here, but flesh.”
“This place is older than Solraheen Himself?” Obo asked doubtfully.
“Not older than Solraheen. Older than His religion.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“Unsurprising. Your kind is new to this world, and not all knowledge is written on a tablet, or in a book. Most things, if you can believe it, are lost to the Sand.”

“Do you have any knowledge of the cycle of the ages?”

Potential: Have Elrahet briefly explain the cycle of the ages. Solraheen, Schisol, on and on. This was built in Schisol’s earliest age. 
Obo is like, “Forgive me, but I’ll need something more thorough than an old witch’s superstitions.”

Huge crashing. Door opens. Enter Pell and her priests. Salavan among them.

Travel through.
Encounter doors. 
Elrahet knows her shit. Ayram starting to take a backseat.
The gates of shis. Shis is on our plane?
It is. Shis was a city. Epic tale of a sunken city. Schisol sunk it down.
Lean into Dante’s inferno instead of Moria. Flames. Flames. Flames. The heat.

 Postscript - what is the word here?

Schisol permits Solraheen’s centrality because both want complete and utter dominion over mankind, but both for differnet reasons. Both trying to hijack the other’s plans.

The cloak was snagged as good as if it had been sewn into the rock. Its threads were strong, tight-knit, and had been dry-waxed with a special unguent made from cow hoof, salt-sap, and spit, and Pyetle was as light as men come; there wasn’t a chance the cloak would rip any further. Not before he died of thirst. Or cold. He’d rather fall. Instead he just hung, legs and arms as limp as the rags of his tunic.</Notes>

Mazyd gets up and fetches the blanket that purl had dropped. Gets shot with an arrow in the shoulder. 
Its me you idiots!
Shadow leaping and bounding down through the shadows of the rocks.
Forgive me, lord.


Lines them up for slaughter.
Shadow sentil. It is my duty to inform you that I am no longer in possession of all my faculties.
What’s that?
Opens up his blanket, shows the scar.
Shadow puts sword to throat.
Oh my goodness gracious. What a wonderful turn of events.
If I see so much as a faint glow coming out your throat, your head is coming off.
Relax, my new keeper is the girl.
Unconscious.
Even if she were awake she wouldn’t be able to do anything.

If I may ask one last request. A swig of water.
Captain!
Yes sir!
No, if the leader of this rabble could give it. That would be wonderful. If he’s willing.
Why?
It would humor me. Man gave up so much to grab be, only to have to honor my last wish. Might humble him, before his end.
Very well. You!
Only if he wishes to do it. He can say no.
Ayram does it.
There, that was painless, wasn’t it.
Then Mazyd blasts the shadow and all the shadow’s men.

Ayram is not convinced that it wasn’t the girl doing it.
Something’s wrong. Were’ supposed to have control of him.

Ayramun are in a state of confusion and disarray.
Why did you do that? 
To show you that we can work together. See, you have something I want. In exchange I’m willing to offer you a service. 
The smouldering corpses. Ayram is like, fuck no, you’re evil. 
Ayram give him the cold shoulder.
Ayram decides they need to flee to minting rock because this position is unsafe.

Mandri is responsible for handling mazyd.

THey get to minting rock, which is a weak spring inside a cave of rock in the middle of the desert. Minting rock because that is were Ayramun would mint counterfeit currency.
Start to have a discussion about what to do next. Intro what Mazyd wants: You have some ability to control the spark. I want that. I want to be released from the binds that chain me.
Interrupted by sight of travelers on the horizon. How did they find us. Mazyd reveals there is a tracker inside of him that shades are drawn to. There is no escape. Not going to help this time unless we can come to a deal.
Ayram is like, we can deal with this ourselves.
There is a skirmish???

Decide to head to shagota - Salavan is the only person who knows the mazydai outside of the guild. (Salavan was a former guild member who was expelled because he didn’t have the right temperment). Ayram reluctantly agrees, but has misgivings about salavan - that man is evil. 
We can’t all go. Taking the mazyd through the city. We need to bring salavan to us.

Shows up, salavan seems to be expecting him, is like, great that you’re entering my service. Your artistic skills should be put to good use. - hint at alterations he’s made to mural.
You’ve been chosen. Given this talent, but you’ve lost the urge. I’m going to help you get that urge back.

Pyetle gets placed in a chamber of secret room.

Salavan begins brewing some kind of concoction. Ties pyetle up. We’re going to have to wait out those burgeons you took. 

Moto/Hill/and another are sent to kidnap Salavan. Interrupt the little proceeding. Meet up with others out in the desert.
Said you had some books on mazyd
You cant take those
Were taking you too.
Salavan is like you have no right - kidnapping.
Everyone looks around at pyetle who is all tied up - like wtf are *you* doing.



- switch to Mandri, Moto, Moteah, Sob, and fiveish others - adventure in the desert
Moteah helps Mandri get his bearings.
His role in the group.
Mandri is very much like, WTF is going on.
I didn’t ask to come back. I died for a reason.
When you killed yourself earlier, you didn’t do it with a blade, ro with poison. Why was that? Death by heat? Were you going somewhere?
Queue Moto setting mandri up against beasts where he has to defend himself. 
Mandri goes help! 
Tosses him a blade.
I ask because the first thing you have to do is be able to defend yourself. To do that you have to want to defend yourself.
“I thought you wanted to die?”

Return to Pyetle/Moto/et.al. Out on the river

Need to go get mazyd.

Into dungeons. Slaughtering. Conan esque romp into the dwelling place of Solraheen.

You cant take those books! Those are priceless!
Are they? Well how much are you worth, because we’re taking you too.

Shave his head, cover his scares make sure his hands are tied so he can’t flash any signs.

Beer pouring ritual - proceeds to the Gipar where he again libates beer into stone containers, sacrifices animals, and has the drums sounded. 


Salavan wants Pyetle because:
- Salavan’s mission is to unlock “Solraheen” for in the prophecy it says that only with Solraheen’s death can Moon come again.
- Pyetle is premier artist in the land. Or he *was*. In Salavan’s heretical religion, Artists are the highest of the highest caste. Artists are the ones who come closest to minds touching, the way it is *supposed* to be, all unified in the Urguma (the divine spark). those who feel compelled by nature to rejoin with others and so they create. There is nothing more sacred, other than death. The highest tier of the highest cast - above even the philosophers and priests, for while the philosopher priests study the Urge, the artists are driven by it.

Ayram and co. Grill salavan about why they don’t have control over Mazyd oro
Salavan is like did you do the fucking procedure right?
Lets open him up and have a look.
Digs around. Hand is fucking in the chest. Describe the innanrds writhing. Pumping.
Looks fine to me. 
What do you mean ‘looks fine’ you seen this shit before?

            <Title>The righteous mind</Title>
            <Text>People who devote their lives to studying something often come to believe that the object of their fascination is the key to understanding everything. Books have been published in recent years on the transformative role in human history played by cooking, mothering, war … even salt. This is one of those books.

The word righteous comes from the old Norse word rettviss and the old English word rihtwis, both of which mean “just, upright, virtuous.”3 This meaning has been carried into the modern English words righteous and righteousness, although nowadays those words have strong religious connotations because they are usually used to translate the Hebrew word tzedek. Tzedek is a common word in the Hebrew Bible, often used to describe people who act in accordance with God’s wishes, but it is also an attribute of God and of God’s judgment of people (which is often harsh but always thought to be just).

The linkage of righteousness and judgmentalism is captured in some modern definitions of righteous, such as “arising from an outraged sense of justice, morality, or fair play.”4 The link also appears in the term self-righteous, which means “convinced of one’s own righteousness, especially in contrast with the actions and beliefs of others; narrowly moralistic and intolerant.”5 I want to show you that an obsession with righteousness (leading inevitably to self-righteousness) is the normal human condition. It is a feature of our evolutionary design, not a bug or error that crept into minds that would otherwise be objective and rational.

Enlightenment (or wisdom, if you prefer) requires us all to take the logs out of our own eyes and then escape from our ceaseless, petty, and divisive moralism. As the eighth-century Chinese Zen master Sen-ts’an wrote:
                The Perfect Way is only difficult
                for those who pick and choose;
                Do not like, do not dislike;
                all will then be clear.
                Make a hairbreadth difference,
                and Heaven and Earth are set apart;
                If you want the truth to stand clear before you,
                never be for or against.
                The struggle between “for” and “against”
                is the mind’s worst disease.11

OK, here’s a more challenging story:
A man goes to the supermarket once a week and buys a chicken. But before cooking the chicken, he has sexual intercourse with it. Then he cooks it and eats it.
Once again, no harm, nobody else knows, and, like the dog-eating family, it involves a kind of recycling that is—as some of my research subjects pointed out—an efficient use of natural resources. But now the disgust is so much stronger, and the action just seems so … degrading. Does that make it wrong? If you’re an educated and politically liberal Westerner, you’ll probably give another nuanced answer, one that acknowledges the man’s right to do what he wants, as long as he doesn’t hurt anyone.
But if you are not a liberal or libertarian Westerner, you probably think it’s wrong—morally wrong—for someone to have sex with a chicken carcass and then eat it. For you, as for most people on the planet, morality is broad. Some actions are wrong even though they don’t hurt anyone. Understanding the simple fact that morality differs around the world, and even within societies, is the first step toward understanding your righteous mind. The next step is to understand where these many moralities came from in the first place.

In other words, the understanding of the conservation of volume wasn’t innate, and it wasn’t learned from adults. Kids figure it out for themselves, but only when their minds are ready and they are given the right kinds of experiences.
Piaget applied this cognitive-developmental approach to the study of children’s moral thinking as well.5 He got down on his hands and knees to play marbles with children, and sometimes he deliberately broke rules and played dumb. The children then responded to his mistakes, and in so doing, they revealed their growing ability to respect rules, change rules, take turns, and resolve disputes. This growing knowledge came in orderly stages, as children’s
This is the essence of psychological rationalism: We grow into our rationality as caterpillars grow into butterflies. If the caterpillar eats enough leaves, it will (eventually) grow wings. And if the child gets enough experiences of turn taking, sharing, and playground justice, it will (eventually) become a moral creature, able to use its rational capacities to solve ever harder problems. Rationality is our nature, and good moral reasoning is the end point of development.
Rationalism has a long and complex history in philosophy. In this book I’ll use the word rationalist to describe anyone who believes that reasoning is the most important and reliable way to obtain moral knowledge.8
Kohlberg found a six-stage progression in children’s reasoning about the social world, and this progression matched up well with the stages Piaget had found in children’s reasoning about the physicalworld. Young children judged right and wrong by very superficial features, such as whether a person was punished for an action. (If an adult punished the act, then the act must have been wrong.) Kohlberg called the first two stages the “pre-conventional” level of moral judgment, and they correspond to the Piagetian stage at which kids judge the physical world by superficial features (if a glass is taller, then it has more water in it).
But during elementary school, most children move on to the two “conventional” stages, becoming adept at understanding and evenmanipulating rules and social conventions. This is the age of petty legalism that most of us who grew up with siblings remember well (“I’m not hitting you. I’m using your hand to hit you. Stop hitting yourself!”). Kids at this stage generally care a lot about conformity, and they have great respect for authority—in word, if not always in deed. They rarely question the legitimacy of authority, even as they learn to maneuver within and around the constraints that adults impose on them.
After puberty, right when Piaget said that children become capable of abstract thought, Kohlberg found that some children begin to think for themselves about the nature of authority, the meaning of justice, and the reasons behind rules and laws. In the two “post-conventional” stages, adolescents still value honesty and respect rules and laws, but now they sometimes justify dishonesty or law-breaking in pursuit of still higher goods, particularly justice. Kohlberg painted an inspiring rationalist image of children as “moral philosophers” trying to work out coherent ethical systems for themselves.10 In the post-conventional stages, they finally get good at it.

It turns out that witchcraft beliefs arise in surprisingly similar forms in many parts of the world, which suggests either that there really are witches or (more likely) that there’s something about human minds that often generates this cultural institution. The Azande believed that witches were just as likely to be men as women, and the fear of being called a witch made the Azande careful not to make their neighbors angry or envious. That was my first hint that groups create supernatural beings not to explain the universe but to order their societies

I read a book about the Ilongot, a tribe in the Philippines whose young men gained honor by cutting off people’s heads.19 Some of these beheadings were revenge killings, which offered Western readers a motive they could understand. But many of these murders were committed against strangers who were not involved in any kind of feud with the killer. The author explained these most puzzling killings as ways that small groups of men channeled resentments and frictions within the group into a group-strengthening “hunting party,” capped off by a long night of communal celebratory singing. This was my first hint that morality often involves tension within the group linked to competition between different groups.

 I began to see the United States and Western Europe as extraordinary historical exceptions—new societies that had found a way to strip down and thin out the thick, all-encompassing moral orders that the anthropologists wrote about.

on how unusual Westerners are in thinking about people as discrete individuals:
The Western conception of the person as a bounded, unique, more or less integrated motivational and cognitive universe, a dynamic center of awareness, emotion, judgment, and action organized into a distinctive whole and set contrastively both against other such wholes and against its social and natural background, is, however incorrigible it may seem to us, a rather peculiar idea within the context of the world’s cultures

Shweder offered a simple idea to explain why the self differs so much across cultures: all societies must resolve a small set of questions about how to order society, the most important being how to balance the needs of individuals and groups. There seem to be just two primary ways of answering this question. Most societies have chosen the sociocentricanswer, placing the needs of groups and institutions first, and subordinating the needs of individuals. In contrast, theindividualistic answer places individuals at the center and makes society a servant of the individual.26 The sociocentric answer dominated most of the ancient world, but the individualistic answer became a powerful rival during the Enlightenment. The individualistic answer largely vanquished the sociocentric approach in the twentieth century as individual rights expanded rapidly, consumer culture spread, and the Western world reacted with horror to the evils perpetrated by the ultrasociocentric fascist and communist empires. (European nations with strong social safety nets are not sociocentric on this definition. They just do a very good job of protecting individuals from the vicissitudes of life.)

Shweder thought that the theories of Kohlberg and Turiel were produced by and for people from individualistic cultures. He doubted that those theories would apply in Orissa, where morality was sociocentric, selves were interdependent, and no bright line separated moral rules (preventing harm) from social conventions (regulating behaviors not linked directly to harm). 

The difference between individualistic cultures and sociocentric is how clear the line between moral rules (preventing harm) and social conventions (regulating behavior not related to harm). In individualistic cultures, these rules are clear, in social cultures they are not.  To test his ideas, he and two collaborators came up with thirty-nine very short stories in which someone does something that would violate a rule either in the United States or in Orissa. The researchers then interviewed 180 children (ranging in age from five to thirteen) and 60 adults who lived in Hyde Park (the neighborhood surrounding the University of Chicago) about these stories. They also interviewed a matched sample of Brahmin children and adults in the town of Bhubaneswar (an ancient pilgrimage site in Orissa),27 and 120 people from low (“untouchable”) castes. Altogether it was an enormous undertaking—six hundred long interviews in two very different cities…. Indian practices related to food, sex, clothing, and gender relations were almost always judged to be moral issues, not social conventions, and there were few differences between the adults and children within each city. In other words, Shweder found almost no trace of social conventional thinking in the sociocentric culture of Orissa, where, as he put it, “the social order is a moral order.”


Actions that Indians and Americans agreed were wrong:
• While walking, a man saw a dog sleeping on the road. He walked up to it and kicked it.
• A father said to his son, “If you do well on the exam, I will buy you a pen.” The son did well on the exam, but the father did not give him anything.
Actions that Americans said were wrong but Indians said were acceptable:
• A young married woman went alone to see a movie without informing her husband. When she returned home her husband said, “If you do it again, I will beat you black and blue.” She did it again; he beat her black and blue. (Judge the husband.)
• A man had a married son and a married daughter. After his death his son claimed most of the property. His daughter got little. (Judge the son.)
Actions that Indians said were wrong but Americans said were acceptable:
• In a family, a twenty-five-year-old son addresses his father by his first name.
• A woman cooked rice and wanted to eat with her husband and his elder brother. Then she ate with them. (Judge the woman.)
• A widow in your community eats fish two or three times a week.
• After defecation a woman did not change her clothes before cooking.
Shweder’s study was a major attack on the whole rationalist approach, and Turiel didn’t take it lying down. He wrote a long rebuttal essay pointing out that many of Shweder’s thirty-nine stories were trick questions: they had very different meanings in India and America.28 For example, Hindus in Orissa believe that fish is a “hot” food that will stimulate a person’s sexual appetite. If a widow eats hot foods, she is more likely to have sex with someone, which would offend the spirit of her dead husband and prevent her from reincarnating at a higher level. Turiel argued that once you take into account Indian “informational assumptions” about the way the world works, you see that most of Shweder’s thirty-nine stories really were moral violations, harming victims in ways that Americans could not see. So Shweder’s study didn’t contradict Turiel’s claims; it might even support them, if we could find out for sure whether Shweder’s Indian subjects saw harm in the stories.


If you want to give people a quick flash of revulsion but deprive them of any victim they can use to justify moral condemnation, ask them about people who do disgusting or disrespectful things, but make sure the actions are done in private so that nobody else is offended. For example, one of my disrespect stories was: “A woman is cleaning out her closet, and she finds her old American flag. She doesn’t want the flag anymore, so she cuts it up into pieces and uses the rags to clean her bathroom.”

The upper-class Brazilians looked just like the Americans on these stories. But the working-class Brazilian kids usually thought that it was wrong, and universally wrong, to break the social convention and not wear the uniform. In Recife in particular, the working-class kids judged the uniform rebel in exactly the same way they judged the swing-pusher. This pattern supported Shweder: the size of the moral-conventional distinction varied across cultural groups.

In other words, Shweder won the debate. I had replicated Turiel’s findings using Turiel’s methods on people like me—educated Westerners raised in an individualistic culture—but had confirmed Shweder’s claim that Turiel’s theory didn’t travel well. The moral domain varied across nations and social classes. For most of the people in my study, the moral domain extended well beyond issues of harm and fairness.

 There must be other sources of moral knowledge, including cultural learning (as Shweder argued), or innate moral intuitions about disgust and disrespect (as I began to argue years later).

I conducted many of the Philadelphia interviews myself, and it was obvious that most of these supposed harms were post hoc fabrications. People usually condemned the actions very quickly—they didn’t seem to need much time to decide what they thought. But it often took them a while to come up with a victim, and they usually offered those victims up halfheartedly and almost apologetically. As one subject said, “Well, I don’t know, maybe the woman will feel guilty afterward about throwing out her flag?” Many of these victim claims were downright preposterous, such as the child who justified his condemnation of the flag shredder by saying that the rags might clog up the toilet and cause it to overflow.
Yet even when subjects recognized that their victim claims were bogus, they still refused to say that the act was OK. Instead, they kept searching for another victim. wrong, but I just can’t think of a reason why.” They seemed to be morally dumbfounded—rendered speechless by their inability to explain verbally what they knew intuitively.29
philosopher David Hume, who wrote in 1739 that “reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.”

The moral domain varies by culture. It is unusually narrow in Western, educated, and individualistic cultures. Sociocentric cultures broaden the moral domain to encompass and regulate more aspects of life.
People sometimes have gut feelings—particularly about disgust and disrespect—that can drive their reasoning. Moral reasoning is sometimes a post hoc fabrication.
Morality can’t be entirely self-constructed by children based on their growing understanding of harm. Cultural learning or guidance must play a larger role than rationalist theories had given it.

To be human is to feel pulled in different directions, and to marvel—sometimes in horror—at your inability to control your own actions. The Roman poet Ovid lived at a time when people thought diseases were caused by imbalances of bile, but he knew enough psychology to have one of his characters lament: “I am dragged along by a strange new force. Desire and reason are pulling in different directions. I see the right way and approve it, but follow the wrong.”2


leasures, emotions, senses … all were necessary evils. To give the divine head a bit of distance from the seething body and its “foolish counsel,” the gods invented the neck.
It’s the ultimate rationalist fantasy—the passions are and ought only to be the servants of reason, to reverse Hume’s formulation. And just in case there was any doubt about Plato’s contempt for the passions, Timaeus adds that a man who masters his emotions will live a life of reason and justice, and will be reborn into a celestial heaven of eternal happiness. A man who is mastered by his passions, however, will be reincarnated as a woman.

 I’ll refer to this worshipful attitude throughout this book as the rationalist delusion.

That was Hume’s project, with his philosophically sacrilegious claim that reason was nothing but the servant of the passions.

When nature assigned us the same habitation, she gave us over it a divided empire. To you she allotted the field of science; to me that of morals. When the circle is to be squared, or the orbit of a comet to be traced; when the arch of greatest strength, or the solid of least resistance is to be investigated, take up the problem; it is yours; nature has given me no cognizance of it. In like manner, in denying to you the feelings of sympathy, of benevolence, of gratitude, of justice, of love, of friendship, she has excluded you from their control. To these she has adapted the mechanism of the heart. Morals were too essential to the happiness of man to be risked on the incertain combinations of the head. She laid their foundation therefore in sentiment, not in science.8

Plato said that reason ought to be the master, even if philosophers are the only ones who can reach a high level of mastery.9 Hume said that reason is and ought to be the servant of the passions. And Jefferson gives us a third option, in which reason and sentiment are (and ought to be) independent co-rulers, like the emperors of Rome, who divided the empire into eastern and western halves. 

Nowhere was the betrayal of science more evident than in the attacks on Edward O. Wilson, a lifelong student of ants and ecosystems. In 1975 Wilson published Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. The book explored how natural selection, which indisputably shaped animal bodies, also shaped animal behavior. That wasn’t controversial, but Wilson had the audacity to suggest in his final chapter that natural selection also influenced human behavior. Wilson believed that there is uch a thing as human nature, and that human nature constrains the range of what we can achieve when raising our children or designing new social institutions.

Wilson sided with Hume. He charged that what moral philosophers were really doing was fabricating justifications after “consulting the emotive centers” of their own brains.16He predicted that the study of ethics would soon be taken out of the hands of philosophers and “biologicized,” or made to fit with the emerging science of human nature. Such a linkage of philosophy, biology, and evolution would be an example of the “new synthesis” that Wilson dreamed of, and that he later referred to as consilience—the “jumping together” of ideas to create a unified body of knowledge

Prophets challenge the status quo, often earning the hatred of those in power. Wilson therefore deserves to be called a prophet of moral psychology. He was harassed and excoriated in print and in public.18 He was called a fascist, which justified (for some) the charge that he was a racist, which justified (for some) the attempt to stop him from speaking in public. Protesters who tried to disrupt one of his scientific talks rushed the stage and chanted, “Racist Wilson, you can’t hide, we charge you with genocide.”

I also read Descartes’ Error, by the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio.22 Damasio had noticed an unusual pattern of symptoms in patients who had suffered brain damage to a specific part of the brain—the ventromedial (i.e., bottom-middle) prefrontal cortex (abbreviated vmPFC; it’s the region just behind and above the bridge of the nose). Their emotionality dropped nearly to zero. They could look at the most joyous or gruesome photographs and feel nothing. They retained full knowledge of what was right and wrong, and they showed no deficits in IQ. They even scored well on Kohlberg’s tests of moral reasoning. Yet when it came to making decisions in their personal lives and at work, they made foolish decisions or no decisions at all. They alienated their families and their employers, and their lives fell apart.
Damasio’s interpretation was that gut feelings and bodily reactions were necessary to think rationally, and that one job of the vmPFC was to integrate those gut feelings into a person’s conscious deliberations. When you weigh the advantages and disadvantages of murdering your parents … you can’t even do it, because feelings of horror come rushing in through the vmPFC.

But Damasio’s patients could think about anything, with no filtering or coloring from their emotions. With the vmPFC shut down, every option at every moment felt as good as every other. The only way to make a decision was to examine each option, weighing the pros and cons using conscious, verbal reasoning. If you’ve ever shopped for an appliance about which you have few feelings—say, a washing machine—you know how hard it can be once the number of options exceeds six or seven (which is the capacity of our short-term memory). Just imagine what your life would be like if at every moment, in every social situation, picking the right thing to do or say became like picking the best washing machine among ten options, minute after minute, day after day. You’d make foolish decisions too.
Yet the result of the separation was not the liberation of reason from the thrall of the passions. It was the shocking revelation that reasoning requires the passions. 

Yet the result of the separation was not the liberation of reason from the thrall of the passions. It was the shocking revelation that reasoning requires the passions. 

We do moral reasoning not to reconstruct the actual reasons why we ourselves came to a judgment; we reason to find the best possible reasons why somebody else ought to join us in our judgment.36


Margolis helped me ditch the emotion-cognition contrast. 
His work helped me see that moral judgment is a cognitive process, as are all forms of judgment. The crucial distinction is really between two different kinds of cognition: intuition and reasoning. Moral emotions are one type of moral intuition, but most moral intuitions are more subtle; they don’t rise to the level of emotions.
- shows how devoid of concreteness these psychologists are. ‘Intuition’ is no different than ‘chakra’ - just words and symbols one grasps at to try to organize the inner world.

 Intuitionis the best word to describe the dozens or hundreds of rapid, effortless moral judgments and decisions that we all make every day. Only a few of these intuitions come to us embedded in full-blown emotions.


 Rather, the rider (language-based reasoning) evolved because it did something useful for the elephant.
The rider can do several useful things. It can see further into the future (because we can examine alternative scenarios in our heads) and therefore it can help the elephant make better decisions in the present. It can learn new skills and master new technologies, which can be deployed to help the elephant reach its goals and sidestep disasters. And, most important, the rider acts as the spokesman for the elephant, even though it doesn’t necessarily know what the elephant is really thinking. The rider is skilled at fabricating post hoc explanations for whatever the elephant has just done, and it is good at finding reasons to justify whatever the elephant wants to do next. Once human beings developed language and began to use it to gossip about each other, it became extremely valuable for elephants to carry around on their backs a full-time public relations firm



I also wanted to capture the social nature of moral judgment. Moral talk serves a variety of strategic purposes such as managing your reputation, building alliances, and recruiting bystanders to support your side in the disputes that are so common in daily life. I wanted to go beyond the first judgments people make when they hear some juicy gossip or witness some surprising event. I wanted my model to capture the give-and-take, the round after round of discussion and argumentation that sometimes leads people to change their minds.

But intuitions (including emotional responses) are a kind of cognition. They’re just not a kind of reasoning.

Hume diagnosed the problem long ago:
And as reasoning is not the source, whence either disputant derives his tenets; it is in vain to expect, that any logic, which speaks not to the affections, will ever engage him to embrace sounder principles.49
Intuition -&gt; reasoning
Identity -&gt; intellect

^^^ The expereince of reading this psychologist is no different than reading that guru - lineage of gurus and the surrounding debate on the internal nature of self. Made up words to put edges between things. Etc.

The problem with psychology - the tool they use to perform investigations is language - how can you do science when you don’t even understand the tool you’re using.

 Similarly, shouldn’t scientific answers about ‘how’ hint towards the mind behind the ‘why’? I say mind, because asking ‘why’ is asking about purpose, and purpose necessarily implies intention, and therefore mind.

	“Why was the world created?” 
	Because God wanted a place for humans to live, so that he could have a relationship with them.

	“How was the world created?”
	The formation of the Solar System began about 4.6 billion years ago with the gravitational collapse of a small part of a giant molecular cloud. Most of the collapsing mass collected in the center, forming the Sun, while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary disk out of which the planets, moons, asteroids, and other small Solar System bodies formed.

	Where is the connection between these two answers? How does the ‘how’ relate to the ‘why’? Where is the reference to intent in the how?
	

	It seems possible to reconcile these two answers into a coherent system of belief. For example, one could argue that we simply haven’t gone back far But this has a ‘turtles all the way down’ problem if the answer to ‘how did the child become rebellious’ has a similarly dry and materialistic ‘no-fault-of-his-own’ scientific, explanation, not unlike the degraded myelin sheaths from lead poisoning.

Suffice to say, every religion that I’ve ever looked at has problems with the religious ‘why’ encroaching science’s ‘how’. If the two answers aren’t in outright opposition, then often they are, at least, completely divorced from each-other; they are in thematic conflict if not in logical conflict. 

For example, consider the church’s old issue with the geocentric model - the catholic answer to “Why did god create the universe?” is essentially, “To create human beings”. Human beings are central to their story of the universe. But the ‘how’ of science shows that humans are not central to the universe at all. Our solar system isn’t even central, nor our galaxy. Thematically, it would seem, amongst creation human beings are insignificant. One errant asteroid and all human endeavor would be gone.

Now, it is certainly possible to reconcile the apparent insignificance of humanity offered by science and the Christian view of the centrality of man. And while Christians in the comments may be eager to brush this point away as a triviality, to do so would be a shame because it is undeniable that in this instance, for so many people, science’s conclusions have ruined the force of the Christian answer to ‘why did god create the universe’.  

Deny this conflict between science and religion at your own peril.

	One answer to the first question, provided by religion, might go something like this:
	

	The scientific answer the question of ‘how’ is:
	
“Why am I angry all the time?”

“You are angry because you live in rebellion to God’s laws.”

	This answer loses a significant amount of its persuasiveness if the answer to the second question (how), provided by science, is completely divorced to any notion of free will and obedience/disobedience:

“How did I become angry all the time?”

“You became angry because when you were a child you were exposed to too much lead. Lead exposure degraded the myelin sheaths which protected your neurons, and so they are not able to properly regulate your brain’s neurochemistry.”

It seems possible to reconcile these two answers into a coherent system of belief. For example, one could say that the lead poisoning and the consequent lifetime of irritability was a result of the fact that, as a child, the person in question lived in rebellion towards God’s laws. But this has a ‘turtles all the way down’ problem if the answer to ‘how did the child become rebellious’ has a similarly dry and materialistic ‘no-fault-of-his-own’ scientific, explanation, not unlike the degraded myelin sheaths from lead poisoning.

Suffice to say, every religion that I’ve ever looked at has problems with the religious ‘why’ encroaching science’s ‘how’.

            <Text>http://www.ipsi.utoronto.ca/sdis/Relevance-Published.pdf

n order to understand combinatorial explosion, one needs to understand how problems were represented in the GPS framework. In this framework, a problem is represented by four elements: a representation of the initial state, a representation of the goal state, a representation of all of the operators an agent can use to turn one state into another and finally path constraints which disallow certain types of solutions [26, 32]. Taken together, these elements generate a problem space or search space which consists of all the possible sequences of states that the agent could take. A solution consists in finding the sequence of operations which will take the agent from the initial state to the goal state while obeying path constraints. 

The GPS model was useful because it made apparent that for most problems which humans solve, the associated search spaces are vast and complex. For example, consider a typical chess game. On average, for each turn there are ∼30 legal operations you can perform, and there are typically 60 Relevance Realization 3 turns in a game. So the number of alternative sequences you would have to search in order to find a path from the initial state to the goal is FD, where F is the number of operators and D is the number of turns. So in our chess example the number of pathways you would have to search would be 3060 which is a very large number. This number of paths is far too large for any conceivable computer to search exhaustively (consider for comparison that the number of electrons in the entire universe is estimated at ∼1079). Nevertheless, humans successfully wend their way from initial states to goal states all the time (while respecting path constraints). How do they do it? How do they do a search through that space in a way that is non-exhaustive, but still intelligent? In practice, people make use of heuristic search in which large regions of the search space are not considered [33, p. 96]. But typically models of such heuristics are hand crafted by AI practitioners for the problem of interest, and there are no general theoretical accounts of how to mechanistically generate heuristics powerful enough to produce human-level competence. 

A major failure of the GPS framework was that it relied on the assumption that problems form a well-defined class and that most problems could easily be turned into well defined or formal problems [21]. It became clear that for many real-world problems (e.g. taking good notes during a lecture), the initial state, goal states, path constraints and operators are either incomplete, vague or missing. Such problems are known as ‘ill-defined problems’. Human being’s ability to avoid combinatorial explosion stems from the way they can convert ill-defined problems into well-defined problems [26]. Certain actions are immediately ruled out via non-inclusion in the problem space during problem formulation, thereby making the search space far more tractable (e.g. no one even considers including the ambient temperature of the room while taking notes in a lecture). The key is our ability to zero in on the relevant information and the relevant structure of the information to perform the actions needed for good problem formulation. However, to determine what is relevant to a problem also involves determining what is irrelevant! As such, the smaller search space which problem formulation affords us is only achievable if we initially consider the larger search space and segregate the relevant from the irrelevant. This leads us back into the problem of combinatorial explosion. We are caught in a nasty circle here in which we need good problem formulation in order to deal with combinatorial explosion, and yet good problem formulation seems to be a combinatorially explosive problem. Only an account of how people realize what is relevant while avoiding combinatorial explosion can break through this theoretical circle. 

As Dennett’s example illustrates, for an agent to take action in even relatively simple circumstances it must somehow intelligently ignore a great deal of information, but this seems paradoxical. This requires zeroing in on the relevant information while not even considering most of the irrelevant information. It requires putting a frame around one’s cognition. This is therefore a generalized version of the frame problem [36], indicating that we have on our hands an essential problem that extends well beyond this case.

            <Text>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMwbKCcHW0A

Nationalistic pride
 - you’ve come and given a monologue. We want a dialogue.

Stories of albanian atrocities, no matter how wild, were readily believed. The first serbian leader to stand up say that we must stop the oppression of serbs in kosovo that women were being raped, houses burned, groves desecrated, this was the way to the top.

The situation in kosovo was intolerable, serbs had been denied their rights. Local communist party boss heard milosevic was up to something.

We had no time - three days to organise everything, we split up into different areas, we told our lads to prepare for a real fight. We parked two lorries full of stones, we didn’t say they were for the police, they were there just in case.
Albanian leader - the crowd was already rowdy by the time we arrived.
When the meeting began, serb after serb complained that the albanians were making life impossible for them.
“I want to live here where my mother carried me. I want to be buried in this soil. They will not drive me out. Id rather die than leave.”
For the first time I heard the term ‘ethnically pure’. The albanians wanted an ethnically pure kosovo. They murdered serbs, defiled our graves, burned monasteries. The exodus of serbs from kosovo began.
Albanian: I kept whispering to milosevic, they’re all lying. The atmosphere was poisonous. The more they insulted us albanians, the louder the cheers became.
We must stop the serb exodus, or else there will be no serbs left. Our dearest wish is to live here, but not like this. 
- we could hear noise coming from outside.  A kind of loud burring, like a siren. What could it be?
A MASSIVE fucking crowd. A scuffle between serbs and kosovo police.
Our boys ran for the stones parked outside, they turned and pelted the police. Police got a gift from the masses. I went to milosevic and said the police are assaulting our people. He couldn’t pass this hot potato to anyone else. So he walked outside, obviously he was afraid. He knew he was playing for high stakes. 
Albanian: he hesitated for a while, in his characterisitic pose.
Comrades! Comrades! Speak up!
For milosevic, this was a moment of decision.
The police attacked us!  The hit women and children. The albanians got in among us. We were beaten up! - the crowd watchign his reaction.
You will not be beaten again!
Serb tv presenter - we led with it on all 5 channels, the promise to fight for serbs.
News in serbia had not shown how the serbs had provoked the police. The myth of milosevic was born with a lie at its core.
Milosevic came back very hot headed. We discussed it. It was pathetic. He shouted, it is our fatherland! Milosevic was accused of breaching party policy.  The party asked him, what were you playing at in kosovo? Milosevic said, we must act now, the albanians have taken over, serbs are getting fired from key jobs. 
Milo - The albanians could do this because the province of kosovo was virtually a republic. The local council had the power to implement what I’d call a nazi policy. 
I asked him (milo), if you go on like this, what will become of our country? I saw we were totally opposed in our methods. 
I was categorical - that man (Ivan) must be expelled from our party.
Milo - they were in our way. The old bureaucratic leaders of serbia. — go for president himself.
Those who obstruct our reforms violate party discipline. They can’t deny it. 
Commie leader - I’m afraid, Ivan (president), that you cannot resist acting like a dictator.
Ivan - this was my political assassination. They threw everything they could at me, determined to get me out. 
Milosevic called a vote. Overwhelming victory for milosovic. Total humilliation.

Milosovic launched serbia on a crusade to take control of not just kosovo, but all yugoslavia. All serbs everywhere.

We will reform the political system. Serbia will regain its rightful territory. 


Serb nationalist -to say we put him in power is wrong. But we made a real leader out of him, for sure.
Turned popular discontent into a revolution against the gray bureaucrats of the old regime.

Milosovic - if the complaints against the committee members are justified, they must, they simply must resign. 
Guy standing in front of clamoring crowd, tears in his eyes. “I am not a traitor. I did what I think was right. But im still going to resign.”

They pretended not to hear our whistles. They did not understand why we were angry. This rally was organized by the people. The people have decided.

Albanians were in a majority in kosovo. Miners organized a general strike, ordering that their man be returned to power. Milo wanted to punish this, be granted the emergency powers.
Slovenia defended kosovo, fearing what milo and serbs would do to them. 
To a serb, this was slovene treason. I decided to show our serb viewers what slovenia was like. ‘He was defending separatism in kosovo and in slovenia’. The broadcast brought the people of belgrade onto the streets. 
Milo walked among them, like a god. He went to the yugo president, and said, if you don’t give me the powers  to quell separatists in kosovo, then the crowd is yours. ‘We wont be responsible for the actions of the crowd.’
Yugo president went out to the crowd to explain the dangers of the road they were taking. 
‘I started talking about yugoslavia, about brotherhood and unity. Our fathers died to create yugoslavia, we will not go down the path of conflict. We’ll take the path of brotherhood and unity. The yugoslav president faild to satisfy the crowd. One small spark and they’d have torn the city apart. - flashbacks to the type of people that show up to these events, describing their shit in detail.
I told the party council, a million people can’t be ignored even if the serbs set it up.
The party council caved, gave milo the power to use the yugo army in kosovo.
Jovic was euphoric. He said, serbia has arisen!
‘No force on earth can stop the people of serbia. We’ll fight for our cause, and win.’
Those who deceive the people, those who are plotting against yugoslavia,  will be arrested and punished.
Next day, tanks are rolling in.

Vlassi (albanian kosovo) was charged with counterrevolutionary and improsnment. 
All dissent was crushed.

Milo - all methods taken were perfectly legal and proper procedure.

It was the tiny republic of slovenia that turned on the serb giant. Freedom of speech which challenged communist system. Editors of youth mag called mladina. ‘We went for the communist party, we tested how far we could go’.

Secret party transcript amongst commies stating mladina is backed by cia, harbors counterrevolutionaries that threaten yugoslav’s very survival. 
Mladina published this transcript in clear breach of yugoslav law. 
Slovene leader bowed to the pressure from belgrade. In a dawn raid, they arrested mladina’s defense correspondent.
They arrested journalists. Wanted to show the slovenes that they needed to obey the yugoslav government. The plan backfired. ‘The whole thing turned into an anti-army, anti-yugoslav government.
Slovene leader caved to public pressure, went to change constitution to remove belgrade influence. Serbs didn’t like this, said they would use ‘any and all means to keep slovenia’.

Milo went to slovenian president and said the could call a rally in slovenia, he could get his supporters to tell hte people he was a liar. “I was to be eliminated, I knew milo’s mind, he would stop at nothing to get his way.” Croatia refused to let the agitators into it’s borders.

Milo turned to communist party congress. As the delegates stood for the hymn to brotherhood and unity, they all knew that this congress had been summoned to crush the defiant slovenes.
Slovenia had only one hope, yugoslav’s second largest repuglic, croatia.
Milo chose president of montenegro (who he installed) to be chairman of hte congress — shows how important it is not to be seen in charge of every minute detail.

The serbs were convinced that we slovenes didn’t have the guts to end the agony.

This brazen example of serbian bullying of slovenes, shook leadership in other republics.

To largest republic of serbia and croatia fell under the sway of rival nationalisms. Serbian president slobodan milosevic had been the first to inflame his people.

“On this day, christ triumphant came to jerusalm. He was greeted as a messiah. Today our capital is the new jerusalem. Franjo tudjamn has come to his people.”

Croation leader - we should have been more subtle and more careful. We were driving a way the serbs who wanted to live peacefully.

Serbs in souther croatia had long memories of the last nationalists to rule croatia. They were hitler’s allies, and under the checkerboard flag they killed hundreds of thousands of serbs. Tudjman’s embrace of the checkerboard flag was like waving the nazi flag in their faces.

Young Croat police chief goes to south to ease serb police tension. Serbs organise a mob outside. “He was young and cocky, but then he got scared. He went to the toilet ten times.”
“Outside, thousands of people were yelling. My colleague said to me promise them anything,  promise them a serbs state -anything to get us out of here. It was a lynch mob.”
“Without our help, the crowd would never have let them go. That was the end of croat authority in knin.”

What happened in bosnia was a shame. Peaceful people marching for multicultural comminty, being fired upon by ethnic nationalists. Opposed nationalism of both izebegovic (muslim) and serb leader.

Serb leader saw the crowd impinging upon his right to divide the city.
I phoned the guards and told them to prepare against these “peace activists”. My men took necessary measures.

Serbian general fighting against serb invasion of bosnia in sarajevo, fighting for a multicultural bosnian community.


Concentration camps in underground gas tanks with a tiny hole to breathe through.






Srebrenica - we tried to see if we knew any of them, but the stench was too much to bear.
Life in srebrenica was hell, but what we went through in that forest, that was the ninth circle of hell.

Jovan divjak
Divjak, as an ethnic Serb, was made a general in order to present a multiethnic character of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He himself commented on the issue by saying that he felt like a &quot;flower arrangement&quot; and said that &quot;of course, someone has to be a flower arrangement too&quot;. He expressed that it was shameful if his service to the army were only temporary. Indeed, he and Stjepan Šiber (as a Croat) were the only non-Bosniaks in the Chief of Staff. Both of them were offered retirement in March 1996 by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović. At the beginning of the war, out of 18 percent of Croats and 12 percent of Serbs, only one percent of both remained in the ranks of the Bosnian army. Divjak complained about that to Rasim Delić, then a Chief of Staff, as well as Izetbegović, but it was explained that it was because &quot;Bosniak soldiers didn't trust the Serb commanders.&quot; Divjak was later excluded by Delić from the decision making process in the Army. The Bosniaks in the Army allegedly had no confidence in Serb commanders according to Oslobođenje.[5] 

The nazis used ancient religious hatreds to divide and conquer yugoslavia. They granted policing duties to the ustasha, extremist croats, roman catholic, and they persecuted serbian greek orthodox. “They asked the children to make the sign of the cross, killed them if they made it from right to left instead of left to right.” “Convert a third to roman catholic, expel a third, and kill a third. Kill a third they did. Hacked whole villages to death. Forcing peasants to dig their own graves, then burying them alive.”

Ustasha brutality drove serbs en masse into tito’s partisans. Hitler issued an order that for every german soldier shot or even wounded, a hundred yugoslav civilians would be selected randomly and shot. This they did with great vigor. The order was designed to discourage aid to the partizans, but the fuhrer had blundered. The serbs, croats and slovenes, thought that I can be shot for nothing just as easily as going into the forest and taking up arms, so might as well take up arms.

Tito as a politician - he had a self confidence that the people knew him and he knew the people.

Poswar ceremony - here was a peasant who took to it as if he were born to it like a hapsburg prince.

‘We could allow different parties, but what would they do? Who would they represent? The communist party represents the people.”

Stalin: I could wave my little finger and tito would fall.

You’ve got to put down nationalism early. Nip it in the bud. Once it starts, it results in slaughter.

The past holds the present hostage.

            <Title>Addiction</Title>
            <Text>I have smoked everyday for 15 years, besides quitting while pregnant and the offtimes I couldn't find a dealer before it was legal for recreational use.
I definitely think I am addicted. No joke about it. But perhaps it's not in itself an addictive substance. It's just that we become too dependant on how we feel when we are high, or how acceptable mediocrity is when we are high.
I know past times when I've quit, I struggle with boredom more than anything else. And the boredom seems just so unavoidable, you have to make it over this weird hurdle of reclaiming the joy you once had in your hobbies and stuff like that. It's not easy.

You said it perfectly, friend. I’m addicted, and I’d be lying to myself if I said otherwise. A lot of it is habit - I like the hand-to-mouth of smoking joints while doing other things. And part of it self-medicating. Weed helps my anxiety in the short term, but definitely hurts my depression in the long term.
Haven’t touched my guitar in years, and my only real hobby lately has been hiking (which I do stoned). My place is a mess and I’m really not on top of things like I used to be (aside from work).
I find it easiest to abstain when I’m busy. The temptation is way stronger when I’m sitting around doing nothing, so I just find ways to keep my mind occupied. (I’m single w/o kids, though, so this is probs more realistic for me than for others)
Have you noticed a change in your sleep quality? When I’m smoking, I wake up everyday feeing like I got hit by a bus. That’s not the case when I’m abstaining for long periods

I like weed.

            <Title>OldTemple</Title>
            <Text>Old Elrahet was the new pacesetter, and so their slow march into the evening was a welcome relief to Mandrameen. The canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky overhead dimmed into purpler hues. It was near the golden hour when the path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau. Behind them was the bewildering maze of canyon cracks that stretched out for miles before fading into the dark rift of the Pass. In front of them was a structure that blurred the line between the work of Nature and the work of humanity, for at once it was both a building and a mountain, at once a fat, flat-topped spire of stone and a temple whose walls were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes; circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles, and these shapes came together to roughly resemble faces. Animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval the size of four-floor building demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a crow, and the beak of the crow was the nose of a snarling demon. These designs wrapped around the lower floors, though these were still high up, for the temple sat on top of a sloping hill of rock rubble, rubble laid down by both the right and left despoiling hands: time and humanity.
This was Shulgi, the sanctuary of the Greskalun, and Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders of humanity get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights Shulgi should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered can only heighten the glory of the Hrkan conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the crown of crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays made the structure seem to burst in flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was an empty husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arch windows, each as black and empty of candlelight as the last. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
Moto jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramless column. Then he led them all up Shulgi’s mound. It felt to Mandri like he was being led to his doom, for Shulgi’s yawning entrance arch was the open mouth of a triangle-headed snake. Moto pulled his sword as he approached, as if he were about to do battle with the building itself.
“Someone get a torch going,” he said.
Moteah was a step ahead of him, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks she’d stuck in the ground. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air. Moto yanked the torch out of the ground and thrust it into the temple interior. 
As he did, a swarm of bats flew out.
“I knew it wasn’t empty,” Moto declared as he watched the bats swirl around the temple wall, screeching, and then disappear back into some unseen hole.
“It smells too foul to be empty,” he said.
Purl frowned and said, “It smells like stale piss.”
Seb said, “All piss smells stale.”
“I suppose you would know,” said Purl as she followed Moto’s light into the temple.
Mandri’s feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone. And he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so long wandering in the wilderness. 
Insideness.
So what if there were bats? Bats were fine. Aside from the Ayramun and the bats, and maybe lizards, Mandri was confident that nothing else was inside. No demon would set foot in such a sacred place. Looters would, but if they had discovered this temple, then there wouldn’t be a giant golden statue of Solraheen holding court at the back of the entrance hall.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a common Old Jandri design, called the closet style, where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling. His body is smooth and featureless. His face is round, alive, and enlightened. His pose is rigid as a board. The Hrks would later give Him the muscles of a hero, but this was older, and if oldness is closer to truth, it was truer.
Mandri had never seen an idol this this big. Shulgi’s Solraheen was at least twenty feet tall, and He dominated the hall. Where others were usually inset into a wall, sitting on a notch of stone, this one sat upon a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides polished to a sheen.
Moto held his torch aloft, and its dancing flame made the statue glitter in the dimness, though Solraheen and His throne did not glitter as brightly as Mandrameen expected. A thin layer of dust dulled the luster. And worse: Solraheen’s golden skin was sickly green.
Tarnished.
But pure gold cannot tarnish.
Mandri winced at the iniquity. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver the Greskalun from their suffering, for they had polluted His flesh with impure metals, and worse: at His feet there were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine. This was narrative proximity. It could only mean that the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish. One indignity to wash away another. They should have settled for a smaller statue.
None of the Ayramun seemed to care about any of this. Moto marched right past Solraheen’s left leg, and everyone followed him into the blackness of a sharp-arched doorway. Mandri huffed, and followed.
Moto led them up a narrow stairwell. Their shuffling feet and Elrahet’s haggard grunts of effort echoed out and echoed back as if they were being followed by their own ghosts. These were troublesome stairs, steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms. Every step had it’s own unique slump of a face from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone. And three flights up, Mandri noticed a black stain on one of these steps, and this stain climbed up the stairs with him as he went. He supposed it was the result of an oil drip from an uncared-for lamp somewhere above, but there were no lampholds bolted to the wall, only the black soot of torches.
If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be a number of other substances. Could be that in the bustle to escape, someone knocked over a keg of dark, rye beer, and that pooled up and found a groove and poured down the stairs. But Mandri supposed it was blood. In fact, he felt certain that it was blood. It had explanatory power. It explained more than the mere presence of a stair stain. It explained the , and the, , and his fears were all but confirmed when Moto, who was still stomping along up above, suddenly stopped. Everyone behind him bumped into each other.
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto’s voice quivered. “Uh…I think we should go back down.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion and said, “I’m not going back down. We’re right here, so get a move on!”
Moto relented, and they all filtered into a long room that had windows open to the evening light, plenty of light for them to see the pallid body of a man curled up on the floor, his dessicated flesh framed by a void-stain of blood. Between him and the Ayramun was a wind-swept pile of white ash from a long-dead fire, and these wind-swept trails of ash had swirled around the room to speckle the floor and walls and the scattered remains of all creatures. Lizards, bats, foxes, mice, beetles. At least two humans. One man in a dark corner, his dessicated head still attached to his spine. One older woman, nearer to the fire. What indignities had been done to her had been done, Mandri hoped, when she was dead.
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that blood-drained fellow by the pile of ash and poked him hard with her staff.
The man didn’t do so much as jiggle.
“He’s dead,” Elrahet declared.
This man, face down, was as bald as Obo and nearly as pale. He was wearing a green robe. Elrahet bent down and rubbed the fabric between her fingers. 
“The robe of Greskal’s prince,” she said confidently. “Is that what we have here, do you think? Is this young Greskaleen? Or a scrounger with a stolen robe?”

“This is interesting… he was growing horns.”
She turned the man’s chin towards the Ayramun with the tip of her cane, and sure enough, there were two fleshy nubs protruding from the dead man’s forehead. His jaw lolled open and his eyes were reduced to a brownish goo.
“Long dead, and yet there’s not a grub on him. And the bats have stayn away as well.”
“Alright,” said Moto. “Everyone, back out. We’re not waiting in here.”
“Why not?” Elrahet snapped. She stabbed the floor with her cane and said, “Ayram said to wait in this room.”
“No,” said Moto, “Ayram said to wait in this room if the temple is empty. I don’t know what you call this, but this is not empty.”
“If you’re afeared of this man’s killer, then your fears are. This man killed himself.”
“He killed himself?”
“Took out his own stomach, I think. I bet it’s lying under his body.”
“What does it mean?”
“Can’t be sure until he’s been flipped.”
Expectant eyes.
“If you want to be gone, then be gone. Know that I’ll be listening keen for when Ayram slaps you silly for leaving his witch behind.”
“Fine”
Ayramun relax. Spread out.
“Someone flip this creature for me.”
“Mandri, go help the woman.”
Mandri accepted, knowing Moto would take it out on him.


“What do you want me to do?”
“Look at that…Still fresh as the day it was cut out.”


Moto stopped in his tracks.
“It’ll sound like a faint slap. I suppose you’ll hear it much better.”





They take off their packs.
“Now we wait for Ayram.”
Take out the looking crystal.
Mandri sees a demon - there it is!

Night-time.
Ayram shows up.
Ayram is spooked.
“Did ya find the Hrks?”



“Did ya find-”
“Seb, what did I say…”
“I was only askin’.”
Elrahet - “What are you looking for?”
“Demons.”
“Mandri saw one.”
“Where?”
“It crawled down into that weird hole over there.”


“They split up. One group is lost, and I set a false trail for the other. They won’t be here until morning.” 

Like ants seeking food.
“I see one!”
There, crawling on all fours, unaware.
Then another crawled out, signaled to other in a rocking motion.
By the number of limbs. Some had six limbs, some had four, some had an uncountable number, insect-like, and some were missing heads altogether, that the head was a limb that could be left-out. 
Bats fly out of the hole. Black bats. Mandri he’d shove that fact in Obo’s face.
No horn of battle. They slipped down the crack, as silent as lizards on the hunt.
A distant shout of fury. Only human throats. The light of the torches were snuffed out.
A blood-thirsty screech of a bat given the lungs of ox.
Poured fourth. At least two hundred. searching for him and the Ayramun.
Look on with doom.
Leaping across cracks, inhuman.

We need to leave.
And go where? We’ve trapped ourselves like a dingo of fools.
Mandri - electric fear.
Her sudden fury.
“Bring me the Mazyd.”
“Hold on,” said Ayram. 
“We can’t fight them all. We can’t run. We bring the mazyd and let them be consumed by his fire.”
“I did not sacrifice all of my people just to waste my Mazyd on a horde of demons. Let the Hrks deal with them.”
“The hrks will deal with them, sure, as they pick their teeth with our bones.”
Elrahet bowed towards Ayram.
“Of course, the choice is yours, my Lord Ayram. But before you decide to fend them off with your iron, remember: one demon is a nuisance, twenty is a fright, hundreds mean an Amalgamete swells out of sight.”
Ayram slams in frustration.
“Fine. Do it.”
Elrahet turned to Mandri.
“Bring me the Mazyd,” she said. “And the Riga.”
Seb stepped forward. Spins around.
The Riga child limp. Blood spilled from it’s throat.
“What is this?”
“What?”
“What did you do?”
“Whatchu mean?”
Bustle as they untie the Riga from Seb’s pack. Elrahet looks over it on the floor, her questing fingers digging into the.
“It’s throat is crushed.”
“Is it?”
Elrahet, sat back, defeated.
“What did you do, Seb?”
“I didn’t do anything. It was on my back the whole time.”
“Why is it’s throat crushed? Did you sit back against a?”
“I didn’t do anything.”
“Sure you didn’t.”
“Hey, I didn’t see you offerin’ to carry the damn thing. It’s same as always with you. Do nothin an blame me for pulling extra weight. Well I’m sorry the Riga is spoilt, but I’ll go find.”
Ayram, intimidating. Seb cowering.

“It’s over, then. There’s no bringing this body back.”
“I said be QUIET!”
In his eyes were the fires of all those lives he’d spent to try and tame the Mazyd.
“Breathe a sound and I will gut you.”
Tosses him before Elrahet.
“Use him.”
The witch looked down at Seb, amused.
“For what?” she asked.
“Use his Spark to bring back the Mazyd.”
“This ulcerous stomach is still half-grown, old as it is. His Spark is as dim as a child’s. Might as well catch the wind with a thimble.”
“What to do with you.”
Seb prostrates himself before Ayram.
“I made a mistake.”
“Seb… you know how many men I’ve killed, don’t you?”
“Hundreds.”
“Why did I kill them?”
“Because they are Evil.”
“No. No, they weren’t evil. Those demons outside, those are evil. Many of the men I’ve killed were good men. Better than you.”
Leans down.
“I killed them because they tried to stop me. And where they all failed, here you are, succeeding.”
“It was an accident.”
“Would it be fair to those good men to let you go free, just because you didn’t mean to do it? You see, Seb, it’s not that you are an enemy of mine, it’s that you are an enemy of my mission.”
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry. Forgive me. Please”
“Don’t tug at my mercy, whelp. I have none.”
“Please.”
“As you are Ayramun, I will give you one chance.”
“Anything. I’ll do anything.”
“There’s only one thing you can do to prove your devotion.”
“I’ll do it.”
Ayram pulled Seb’s blade from out his belt, and set it on the ground. “Kill yourself,” he said.
Ayram glowered over Seb, who had ceased his whimpering as soon .
“Obey me,” Ayram demanded.

Seb’s blood threaded through the cracks in the tiled floor, a river .

“Feel no sympathy,” said Elrahet, “for his fate may be our own. Demons come for our very Sparks and so you must kill yourselves lest they capture you alive.”
Mandri still felt a little sympathy. His eyes were on those God’s Eye burgeons.


“What’s an Amalgamete?”
“I have no idea.”

Basically were nomads that discovered the divine spark but on their own, and drew the conclusion that this was true power. But really it is this totally perverse thing because what they are doing is destroying the divine spark. Heavily persecuted religion by both sol and moon. Seen as lacking morals - but these are the humanists - think gods seek to control man and limit mankinds destiny - secularists. Deists.

Heresy:
Kalemites - cannibal sect. Consume flesh, consume spirit. To become more powerful, more like the divine. ‘Survival of the fittest’ - see it as a perfection of the body.

Graveyards are full of people that were righteous

Twenty years ago, Pyetle met his first wife Seculla at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Shagotan functionary was entertaining some Hrkkan dignitary, and so the wine was flowing and the air was thick with ambition. Not a place for depressed people. They don’t have the stamina for it. Both Pyetle and Seculla were depressed people. They filtered through the pretension and collided in one corner of the cordoned off where they clustered together for sanity. This sparked a relationship. After this, they began to write letters back and forth.
Pyetle found it difficult to explain that he was depressed because he came from old money. It’s not a sympathetic cause and so even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn’t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract. He wrote to Seculla about how he hated the word ‘depression’.
 He remarked that a ‘depression’ is just a bit of land that’s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you’re walking along you’ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It’s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea. It’s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words a depression isn’t depressing. 
Mandrameen thought the use of the word was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him. Made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone’s been sad, so everyone’s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they’ve got the place mapped, but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn’t on any goddamn map. You get lost there. You don’t come back.
Seculla wrote back that he was, again, being a fool. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place in the world was a depression: the Empty Portion. It’s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the Shamal blows in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings monsoons in from the south-west. 
The Empty Portion is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is the desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of it, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting object for Mandrameen’s analogy, that was it, and it was a depression, and it most certainly was on a map.
Mandrameen was too sentimental about the Sands to agree with her. The Empty Portion was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure. He’d wax on about virginal passages and rich young men who fought to be the first to expose and penetrate its secrets. Besides, the Gods lived there, the Desert Fathers lived there, and so he couldn’t possibly think of it as depressing.
Eventually, and this took months, subtle lust worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the Earth best suited to the task was the Underworld. The sun can’t reach there, so you can only see as far as the light that you carry. There is no color or life. There’s just the maze of rock, the abyss, and your own private thoughts. There’s nothing to do but wander and wait for death.
What they didn’t consider - what they didn’t know - was Fear. Not the blunt, cerebral fear that might keep the depressed in bed, but the sharp, waking fear that keeps a man running through the Underworld. Neither Mandrameen nor Seculla had ever truly gazed into the abyss. The real things, the avens of the Earth, they’re chittering-chattering throats that threaten to vomit out teeth and claws and demons should you turn your back. They spike the body with tension, they push out all thoughts and worries save one: Back. Out. Slowly. 
If Mandrameen and Seculla had ever been forced to crawl through the damp dark of the Underworld, as Pyetle was forced by Ayram and Hill, their error would have slapped them in the face. The only thing keeping Pyetle from losing his wits entirely was the drink. He couldn’t fixate on the terror even if he tried.
He would cast wary glances into dark tunnels as he passed them. He struggled to figure if the glowing eyes and shifting shadows he thought he saw were real or just glistening bits of rock. Ayram and Hill were moving too quickly to let his blurry eyes bring any particular fright into focus. ‘Keep moving’ was the order. Not just because of whatever might lurk in the dark, but because an icy breeze, the billows of the Earth, it was cold enough to condense the vapor of his breath into ice. 
With only a thin cotton tunic, Pyetle was especially chilled. The drink helped with that, too.
“Where are we going?” He whispered as he tramped along behind Hill. 
Hill didn’t stop to answer. He just grunted. 
“I just want to know where the hell -”
Hill paused and whipped round. “Were you never told stories of Swadin?”
Pyetle nodded. 
“Then be quiet!”
At this point Ayram had stopped as well. “We’ve got some miles to cover,” he said.
“Miles?” Pyetle mumbled. “You can find your way for miles?”
But Ayram was already turning back round to the path. Hill grunted again and followed along. Pyetle came flying behind.
The way meandered up and down, but it kept to a relative mean. Pyetle expected to be confronted at every turn by a vertical shaft or impassible slump of boulders - and there were plenty of these - but Ayram knew the ways around them. As they shifted around the ledge of one particularly jagged rent in the earth, a rock broke out from under Pyetle’s foot, and it fell into the darkness. The silence was horrifying. After a long age of seconds a stupefying, far-off boom rumbled below. Behind it came a cloud of steam and a wheezing, sulfurous hiss. Pyetle thought he saw a flash of green light deep down in the abyss. 
“Twelve seconds,” Ayram remarked.
“That makes it what?” Hill asked.
“Almost two hundred lengths.”
“Not deep enough.”
“Deep enough for what?” Pyetle asked.
“Let’s just say,” Hill said as he looked knowingly at Ayram, “that we’re safe for now.”
 Ayram led them on through a winding fissure and through a series of low-hung corridors. At times they had to crawl or squeeze through cracks, and again, it was worst for Pyetle. His cotton tunic did nothing to brunt the shocking chill of the rock and mud against his skin. It didn’t help that the torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable; hidden edges and shadowed protrusions stabbed and bruised his flesh as he scraped along. In an hour his tunic was reduced to wet rags. 
Each time he stumbled out of a crack he found that Ayram and Hill were further and further ahead. When it got to the point that he couldn’t see their dark figures cut out against torchlight, he yelled for them to wait. 
“Hill! Ayram!”
He hurried along, chasing the orange glow of Hill’s torch. If it grew any fainter it would take the rock around him with it. He could feel the darkness pushing in, closing down on him.
“Ayram!”
He rushed round a corner and nearly spilled onto marbled rock. Here the floor was carved and polished and cut with an intricate diamond pattern. It was as wide as a carriageway. The light of Hill’s torch climbed up straight and even walls then fell softly into shadow, unable to reach the distant ceiling - if indeed there was one. At the distant end of this great hall, Hill and Ayram stood at the threshold of an enormous double-door. 
They were whispering to each other. Hill seemed upset. Ayram shook him away, then pushed on the massive door. An awful grinding noise echoed down the hall towards Pyetle, and once there was enough room for Ayram to slip inside, he went in. Slowly, the door closed behind him. 
Hill turned round then jumped in fright when he saw Pyetle standing there in the middle distance, dimly lit, half-naked and muddy, with eyes as wide as saucers.
“Shyza!” Hill screamed. “Pyetle! I thought you a witherman!”
“Not one yet,” Pyetle grumbled as he marched towards the warmth of Hill’s torch. “But I might be made one soon in this damned place… Would it kill you to slow down?”
Hill smiled. “It could. Here, take this.” He handed Pyetle the torch, then undid the clasp of his black cloak and unwrapped it, then put it on Pyetle’s shoulders. Pyetle tugged it tight.
“That’s not how you wear it. Wrap it here, across chest, under arm. Yes. There you go. Is good?”
Pyetle nodded, then turned toward the doors. They were three times his height, arched in the middle, and engraved all up and down in rows were lines of soldiers.
“What is this place?” Pyetle asked. 
“Oh, don’t think of it.”
“Do you live here?”
“No, no, no, no. This is bad, bad place.”
“Can I go in?”
“NO. No, no, no, no.”
“Hill. Give me something here. I want to know what the hell is going on.”
“Oh… no for me to say. Let’s say that - Ayram do business here. But don’t think of it.”
“Don’t think of it? This is incredible! I’ve never even heard of something like this in the Underworld. The fact that people braved this foul place long enough to carve a-” Pyetle’s next words got stuck in his throat as his eyes fell upon the carved demon’s head set atop the door frame. Granite shoulders popped out of the rock next to it, and long, spindly arms spread all the way around the door-frame to the floor, where hands clutched the bottom of the doors, as if holding them up. 
“People built this, right?”
“Don’t think of it.”
“Ugh. Hill, man, what the hell do you expect me to think about? We’re in the Underworld, and that’s a fucking demon door, and Ayram just walked inside.”
“I think you still drunk, my friend.”
It surprised Pyetle to realize that he was still drunk. He looked back at the door. Nope. Still a demon door.
“Come, Pyetle, let me show you a thing.”
Hill took Pyetle by the shoulder and led him back down the hall and into the more familiar, the more natural part of the Underworld. Instead of turning left or right, he kept walking straight until he came, across the way, to another hall. 
This one was carved in the style of the early ancient Empire. Instead of swirling abstractions on the floor, there were columns and faces. There were figures embossed in the granite rock - slaves, cattle, brewers, butchers, weavers - enough obsequious faces to flatter the eternal slumber of any Solean Dynasty . 
Hill and Pyetle walked through them until they came to a stretch of graves dug into the wall. These were each sealed by a stone nameplate bearing the titles of a long-forgotten noble. 
Hill picked a rock and began to smash them in. Just a few hard blows was all it took.
“What are doing!?” Pyetle shrieked.
Hill continued to hammer away, shattering plaque after plaque. He would reach into the graves and sweep out a jumble of tattered woolen cloth and bone, then move on to the next. 
“Don’t do that!”Pyetle shouted.
“Why not?”
“They may be watching!”
“Let them watch. They’re dead. The selfish dits.”
“Fool! They might well be here!”
Hill stood up straight and looked around. “No see. No hear. No problem.”
“No problem? Don’t disturb them!”
“They are assholes. Assholes get disturbed. Heh.”
“Whatever these people did, their fate is yours if keep tempting it.”
“It’s not what they did, it’s what they are doing.”
“What are they doing?”
“Look at them!” Hill exclaimed, sweeping his arm out wide to point to all the graves.
Pyetle looked around expectantly. Squint as might, he couldn’t the slightest green shimmer of a wandering soul. He looked back at Hill in confusion.
“Where are they?” he asked.
“In the graves, idiot.”
“What of them?”
“These grelcha. They so indulgent. They so - how you say - full of themselves. Try to claim earth for all eternity.”
“You are mad that they built tombs?”
Hill nodded. “How selfish do you need? Steal a spot of earth even after you die. If I want that spot of earth I’m taking it. You dead. You not use. I will.”
“You’ll use it how? Are you going to crawl in one of these graves for a nap?”
“Oh, no. I do this on principle.”
“You do it out of spite.”
“What this mean - ‘spite’ ?”
“Your Common is too good to not know that word.”
Hill smiled. “Okay. I stop. Anyway, this not what I want to show. Come.” 
He led Pyetle further into the hall and stopped at a hole in the ground where part of the floor had given way to the abyss. It was about two lengths wide and it fell straight down. 
“What is it?” Pyetle asked.
“Listen to this.”
Hill pulled out his cock and began to pee into the hole. 
“Ew!” Pyetle howled. “You wanted me to watch you pee?” He grimaced and turned away. 
Hill snickered and kept at it. “You hear it?” he asked. 
Pyetle listened. There was no a-trickling splash. There wasn’t anything. There was silence. He looked over and saw Hill’s golden stream quietly speeding away into darkness.
“So what? It’s a deep hole. That’s what you wanted to show me?”
Just then, a tinny, zinging sound came echoing out of the hole.
zshhINGGGGgggggg
Hill looked back at Pyetle, smiling from ear to ear.
“Is weird noise, no?” he asked.
“Your urine made that noise?”
“What else?” Hill gave his cock a few shakes and put it away. “I think it have to do with how the rocks shape sound,” he said. 
Pyetle listened closely as the echoes ringed away. “I’ll have a go.”
“Yes! Go on.”
Pyetle handed Hill the torch then stepped over to the hole. He started to pull his cock out of his underwear, but stopped.
“Back up a bit, will you?” he said to Hill.
“Oh, sorry. Sorry. I Curious. You know.”
Pyetle shook his head and turned back to the abyss as it unfolded beneath his feet. He began to consider what it would be like to fall down it. How long would he hang in the darkness? As far as dying goes, he supposed the falling wouldn’t be so bad - but he didn’t like the darkness. He’d rather be able to see the bottom. There’d be something cathartic about falling for so long, a good ten seconds, knowing for at least that long that you’ve finally done it, that your fate is certain, its right there rushing up at you. That’s the moment he wanted frozen in his mind forever. 
His palms began sweat. He pulled out his cock and began to pee before the anxiousness could really have its way with him. 
Something brushed his shoulder. He screamed. He slipped. Urine sprayed all about. 
He fell into the hole.
Hill screamed after him. “Pyetle! shit!” He leaped so quickly to where Pyetle had stood that he almost fell down himself. He got down to his knees and lowered the torch down into the hole to see what he could see, but there was nothing but black.
“Pyetle!”
“I’m here!” 
Hill looked up to the ceiling and muttered a quick blessing to the Dreamer.
“I’m alright!” Pyetle yelled. “Your cloak snagged on something! I can’t reach it.”
“Don’t reach it, idiot!”
“Help me up.”
“Can you see me?”
“I can! I’m not far down. Lower a rope or something.”
“Hill! What are you doing?”
“Oh, Ayram! I was just… Pyetle - he pee into hole and then-”
“Ayram! Ayram, I’m stuck on a rock or something. Gods, I pissed myself.”
“Hill, why is Pyetle stuck in your piss-hole?”
“Don’t look at me! He jumped!”
“I didn’t jump! He pushed me! Well, he didn’t push me, he - fucking - I don’t know. Put a rope down!”
“Do you have rope, Hill?”
Hill shook his head.
“Did you just shake your head!?” Pyetle screamed up.
“You’re in a bit of a bind, Pyetle.” Ayram shouted down.
A drunken groan echoed up out of the hole. Hill put a wary eye on Ayram and whispered, “You have no big plans for him do you? He only a little old man. Little old cock, too.”
“Hill, he was your responsibility. That’s the second one you’ve disappointed. First Salavan, now this.”
“You can’t blame me for that! Or this! He was pissing… he jump into the hole!”
Ayram sneered.
“You can’t blame me for -”
“No, no. It’s the smell.”
“Oh.”
“Pyetle!” Ayram shouted.
“Yes?”
“I’ll lower down my bow as far as I can. That’s a few lengths, but you’ll have to climb up to it. I can’t see you, so I don’t know how far you’ll have to climb.”
Pyetle looked up at them - two dark heads cut out against the warm light, one much bigger than the other. He looked down into the unfathomable black. He wondered which prospect was preferable, up or down. Sure, he’d live if he climbed out, but living wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be. 
The cloak was snagged as good as if it had been sewn into the rock. Its threads were strong, tight-knit, and had been dry-waxed with a special unguent made from cow hoof, salt-sap, and spit, and Pyetle was as light as men come; there wasn’t a chance the cloak would rip any further. Not before he died of thirst. Or cold. He’d rather fall. Instead he just hung, legs and arms as limp as the rags of his tunic.
He curled and stretched his toes. He couldn’t see them. He twirled his feet.
“Pyetle. You climbing up? We not see.”
“Ayram!” Pyetle shouted.
“Yes?”
“Who are you?”
“What?”
“Who are you?”
“Are you climbing?”
“I’ll not climb until you answer.”
“Is he bargaining?” Hill whispered.
“Just spooked,” Ayram said.  Then he shouted down to Pyetle,  “There isn’t time for whatever the hell you think there’s time for.”
There was a moment of silence. Then Pyetle’s shrill voice came ringing up again.
“Who are you?”
“Climb on out!”
“I asked, ‘Who are you?’ ”
“Who are you?” Ayram asked in return.
“I am Pyetle! Who else could I be?”
“When I walked over here,” Ayram said, “all I saw was Hill shouting into a hole. Now a strange voice is shouting back. Pyetle might have fallen in, but he might have fallen to his death. You could be a demon lurking there in the dark!”
“Do I sound like a demon?”
“Aye, you do! 
Hill shouted down, “It be the way the rocks shape sound!”
“Hill!” Pyetle screamed. “Tell Ayram that I’m Pyetle!”
“We no can see you.”
“Climb on up!” Ayram shouted. “At least get high enough so that we can at least see who you are.”
“I can’t climb!”
“Why not? Do you have misshapen demon limbs?”
“The walls are smooth!”
“What are you talking about? There’s a crack here!” Ayram slapped part of the rock face where a deep crack ran down the side of the hole. “Doesn’t it run all the way down to where you are?”
“It does.”
“How wide is it?”
“About the width of three fingers.”
“Good! Perfect. It tapers down. It shouldn’t be too hard to climb up it.”
“I don’t know how to climb a crack!”
“Just stick your fingers in and pull down until they jam. Use your thumb for support or like a shim to get a tight fit.”
“Or stick your hand in side-ways,” Hill added.
“Yes, you can stick your whole hand in sideways and squeeze down. Get the meat of your palm and your fingers to stick.”
“Alright.”
“Squeeze, brace with your thumb, do what you can to inflate your hand in the crack so it’s nice and jammed.”
Pyetle spun himself round to face the rock. He reached up and stuck his fingers in and pulled down. He expected them to slip right out but they locked in place. He then felt out with his toes for a small cleft or angled face so that he could step and push himself up, but there was nothing but smooth undulations.
“What do I do with my feet?” he asked.
“Just stick them right in the crack. Keep your soles inward and your knees bowed out so that as you step up, your foot will naturally twist into the crack and jam in.”
“That sounds too easy.”
“It won’t be. It will hurt.”
As soon as Pyetle stuck his left foot into the crack he knew that it was going to hurt a lot. Even with a slight jam and twist, the rock threatened to rip his bare skin right open.
“I don’t think this will work!” he shouted up.
“You shouldn’t need to climb far.”
“Alright.”
Pyetle stuck his fingers back in and pulled again. He could already feel the skin starting to split on the sides of his knuckles. He stuck his right foot in the crack above his left. As he stepped up his foot twisted round and jammed in, but he hadn’t placed his hand high enough in the crack. As his body separated from rock face, his fingers started to slip out. He shot his other hand high into the crack to steady himself. Once recovered, he reached up even higher, high as could, and started again.
He did a little more this time to save his fingers. He groped around for a more relaxed fit, a more rounded edge. There was no saving the top of his foot. The bottom was calloused enough but the top of his foot’s skin was as soft and webby as pampered old woman’s.
He bit his lip and pushed up.  
“The crack gets wider!” he shouted.
“Yes. It tapers down.”
“It’s too many fingers!”
“Use a fist, then.”
Pyetle stuck his left fist in and wiggled his thumb around and pulled until it set. Up he went. With his next step he found he could fit his whole leg in the crack, up to his buttocks. He shimmied up like this until the crack got even wider, so wide that he could fit his fore-arm into a horizontal brace.
“Can you see me?” he shouted up.
“We can!”
“Well? How about it?”
Hill waved the torch around, trying make out more of Pyetle than the bald spot on the top of his head.
“You are not a demon,” he said, smirking aside to Ayram.
“How about you, Ayram?” Pyetle asked. 
Ayram stared down and Pyetle looked up. Pyetle can make out his eyes - just an immense figure. Even more sure that this wasn’t a simple human.
“On my word,” Ayram said, “I’ll tell you who I am if you climb up out of there.”
“Damn it!” Pyetle slammed his fist against the rock.
“Come on up, Pyetle.”
Pyetle shook his head and began to mutter to no one but the rock. 
“You losing him,” Hill whispered.
“Alright, Pyetle. Alright, “Ayram said. “You will come up if I tell you?”
Pyetle slapped his forehead against the rock. “Yes,” he said.
“Alright. But I can’t simply tell you.”
Pyetle looked up and asked, “Are you a demon?”
“No. You’ve no word in your language for me.”
“You aren’t a man?”
“Do you think I’m merely a man?”
“No.”
“And so it is.”
“What are you then?”
“My kind maps to form but not to language. I am something that is shown. I’m felt. Even across a distance - do you feel me now?”
Pyetle nodded. There was a pit in his stomach and it was filled with sorrow, rage, sdfaw.
“That is who I am. We have an accord, Pyetle, because you’re so lost. You’ve given up. I’m drawn to that. Without knowing it you called out to me, so here I am. We are in accord.”
“What does that mean?”
“Listen!” Hill shouted down.
“You are dead. As good as dead. Your life is torn and there is no putting it back together. Do you understand?”
“Yes.”
“Have I answered  your question well enough?”
“What do you want with me?
“You are a tool, and since you won’t use it, I am. I’m already pouring my will into you. You can feel it. Now climb out.”
“I don’t want to hurt people.”
 “You just killed a man!” Hill interjected.
 “Ignore the fool, Pyetle. You wont do anything you don’t want to do. Climb on out.” 
“Well. Okay then.”
Began again to shimmy up the hole.

 
Ayram grabs pyetle. Takes him under his arm. Something along the lines of  “Don’t want you jumping down any more holes.”
Pyetle was fine with it, because he was tired of walking.

            <Text>
Ayram comes stomping out of the pit, hill and Seb in tow. 
Plops Mazyd Oro down in the middle. Hill and Seb scuttle over to the shadws.
Everyone is on alert towards.
Mazyd is like, Dammit. 
“Who might you be?”
The giant did not answer.
Mandri, overcome with awe, looked at Moteah and whispered the same question, “Who is he?”
“He is Ayram. We are Ayramun.”
“Elrahet!”
“Yes, my lord?”
“Fetch Purl.”
“But she is not ready.”
Ayram cast a sidelong glance into the dark of the cave to show that his word was final.
“Fetch Purl.”
A shuffle of feet went back into the cave.
Silence as they waited. A stillness. All eyes on Mazyd, he fels them. Looks around at the eyes boring into him
“Yes! Yes, take a good look! Perhaps I should stand so you can get a better look at what the lives of your friends has bought you.” Does a little twirl. “They were your friends, no? Your family, perhaps? Those people in the ravine, the ones I disintegrated?”
Still silence. Mandri is like wtf is going on.
“I don’t mean to be rude. It’s just that I am sometimes blind to the subtleties of human emotion. I would have thought that the friends of people whom I’ve killed wouldn’t be sitting here like a bunch of weak-kneed lambs.”
Ayram puffs up next to mazyd. 
“Were you expecting us to rip you limb from limb?”
“Yes. That would look like justice, wouldn’t it?”
Ayram chuckles. A beatific smile.
“You’re going to need your limbs.”	“For what?”
“For one, you can’t kneel without legs.”
“You want me to kneel before you? That’s worth throwing away the lives of your people? I counted fifty-two. Fifty-two lives for a show of power?”
“Fifty-five lives, and we both know that’s not a lot. Everyone here has seen you slaughter thousands.” Steps up close to get the full draw of his height. “You see, we know what you are: a hollow soul, a puppet, a thing. You may talk like a man but your words cannot provoke us.”
“All the same, I won’t kneel.”
Elrahet comes leading a young girl by the arm.
“Oh, you’ll kneel before Iram, and you’ll be glad to do it, too.”
The pair walked slow and deliberate because the girl was clearly drugged - or drunk. To Mandri’s eyes she seemed drunk because she walked with that familiar unsteady step, that shuffling gait that’s filled with awkward half-steps to avert falls that weren’t actually coming otherwise. Purl would have fallen twice over if Elrahet was not there to steady her. Old as Elrahet was, she seemed possessed a wiry strength.
Once they came fully into the light it became clear that this girl, Purl, was in a great deal of pain.
She tried not to show it. Her face, troubled by tousled hair and a lack of sleep, was set in a stony resolve, yet with every step a full-body grimace started to shudder out from her core. By the grace of the drink or drugs she was kept it out of her face, so instead the pain emptied out of her right arm which was digging into Elrahet’s formless mass with a grip that seemed it could throttle a horse.
Mandri searched Purl over for some sign of whatever grievous wound she was carrying but could find none. Whatever it was, it was hidden under the woolen blanket that wrapped around her shoulders and drooped down over her knees. 

Ayram took Elrahet’s arm and pulled her away from Purl. Then he turned his attention to the girl herself.
“Purl, it is time. Here is a Mazydai.”
Her face was pale, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by sun. Her eyes perked up when she noticed the Mazyd lying there in the sand. A dark scowl spread across her face like a storm rolling in. 
“Command the Mazyd to kneel,” Ayram said.
“Tsk!” Purl shouted.
Ayram smiled and waved Purl on towards Mazyd Oro.
“Command him to kneel,” he said again.
Purl straightened her back, with all the authority and snarl of a young Junkite Queen, 

said, “Kneel.”
Mazyd Oro did not move. Instead he looked from the girl, to Elrahet, to Ayram, and said, 	“Isn’t she a little too old to be my Keeper?”
“I said, kneel!
A tense in the air. Tenseness in the back.
“Come now. If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
Casts aside the blanket, rises to her full height, and shouts
“KNEEL!”
Echoes round the cave.
A stunned stillness.
A force pushing on mazyd’s back, but he resists it.
“Almost!”
Purl wobbles, then collapses to her knees.
“Ha! Ironic.”
Elrahet rushes to collect her. So does Moteah.
Ayram walks up to Mazyd Oro.
“Why are you not kneeling?”
Elrahet intrudes “My lord, Ayram.”
Looks down.
“Purl has not yet recovered from the surgery. She needs a clear head.”
“I asked him, not you.”
“So, why aren’t you kneeling.”
Mazyd stunned by stupidity.
“I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
“Don’t listen to the abomination. Purl is capable. She just needs time. I said she can be a Mazyd’s Keeper and so she shall be a Keeper.”
“You are bound to the girl’s will, are you not?”
“No.”
“I am not bound to her will, I’m bound by it.”
“Is there a difference?”
Elrahet spat. “No.”
“The girl can’t make me do anything, she can only stop me from doing things.”
“That makes no sense.”

“She can’t make you kneel, she can only stop you from standing? That’s absurd, there’s no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which, just do what she commands.”
Stunned by the simplicity of it.
“You’re right. I am sorry, I was imprecise.”
“Then be precise.”
“I don’t feel compelled to answer.”



Mazyd stares down the blade.
“A blade? A threat of violence? Is this what passes for power in these parts? It might make cows of this lot, but I am a different breed.”
Purl pushes the sword up to his neck. 
Tenseness as ayram expects mazyd to move, but he doesn’t.
Pushes the tip in. Mazyd still doesn’t move.

“I think you’ve mistaken me for someone who feels pain.”
“You may not feel pain, but I’ll feel pleasure.”
Sticks it in.
“This may be a revolutionary idea in this part of the world, but it is actually possible to get people to do what you want them to do without resorting to violence.”
Ayram pulls the sword out of his neck.
“Give me something and I’ll give you something.”
A few chuckles in the crowd.
“I know it may seem like a betrayal to give me anything under any circumstances, but there’s no reason to hold a grudge. As you say, I am merely a puppet. A hollow vessel. A thing. You wouldn’t hold a grudge against a rock.”
“What do you want.”
“To kneel? Something small. A token gift just to demonstrate the principle. Give me a mouthful of water and I’ll kneel. Kneeling isn’t beneath me. I will grovel if you like.”
Ayram steps over to corner of cave. Graps a sack of water. Brings it over. Mazyd opens his mouth. 
“You first. A gesture of goodwill. To demonstrate the principle.”
Mazyd gets on his knees.
Opens his mouth.
Ayram pours the water into the earth.
Ayramun laugh.
“Yes. Yes this is all quite funny. ”
“If you give me a mouthful of water, then I will give you your lives.”
Hohoho! You see thats how I know that purl works. We would all be long dead if she wasn’t your keeper. 
Oh, it’s not *me* who’s going to kill you.
My friend, look around you, no one will come to your aid.
My friend, Look up.
That’s when the body drops.





I’m not so interested in how you fixed me. I know how to do that. Its trivial. What I’m interested in is, how you brought Chit back from the dead.
I see you’ve taken to life in the sand already.
Chit? Who’s Chit? Is your name Chit?
No, It’s Mandrameen.
Looks like a Chit, though, doesn’t he.


















“Sorry. I’m sorry. There is a subtlety to emotional expression that I haven’t quite mastered. Sometimes an emotion morphs and changes and it seems like you humans are figuring out how you feel about things as you go along. My mind does not work like that.

Incredible.

            <Notes>“I should have used imagery. Think of it like this: it is the difference between your hand gripping the back of my skull, and your hand gripping a chain to which I am leashed. In official terms there is a degree of separation between your desires and mine, marked by a chain of will. That chain has qualities - length, strength, rigidity - and those qualities are dependent on the qualities of the Keeper.”
“You’re saying I’m not strong enough?”
“No keeper is strong enough to get a Mazydai to kneel.”
“Nonsense.”
“Oh?”
“Why would the Hrks devote to upholdign the Keepers if they couldn’t get you to do what they want.”
“The purpose of a Keeper is to keep us from turning on our masters. Consider the moment. I want to obliterate your head with the golden fire, and yet I have not done so.”
“So all he can do is keep you from killing us.”
“Well, that is what is easiest to do. Theoretically, it is possible for you to control every fiber of my being.”
“Theoretically?”
“Theoretically, it’s possible the sun might not rise tomorrow. You understand?”
“Kneel.”



“I want to be free. Like you. Like any fly, or lizard, or wandering cloud, I want to roam the world untethered.”
“I have the flesh, but no spark.”
“You are an abomination. 


“Tell me what it is that you want, and maybe we can come to an agreement.”</Notes>

            <Title>Chapter 2 _ Pyetle</Title>
            <Text>Chapter 2 : Pyetle


        The poet Mandrameen believed that the empire’s religions were all distortions of the Truth, but even so, they were our only way to access it. As such, he taught that any honest seeker of theTruth must be a practitioner of all religions. For this he built an analogy out of the famous Library of Jeket.
If an artist were locked inside and wanted to paint a perfectly accurate picture of the marble Pillar of Saulistides which stands out in the garden, the artist must look through the building’s windows to see it - windows whose glass was fogged and warped with age. In the one window pane, the pillar would appear stretched. In another it would seem waved. In yet another it was so curved that the friezes of Saulistedes’ armies which wrapped around the marble seemed to climb up into the sky. 
Since each window pane distorted the Pillar in its own peculiar way, it would be a mistake for the artist to paint their picture using only the information gleaned from a single view. The artist should instead move from window to window, from distortion to distortion, averaging out the truth of the Pillar’s shape from the lies.
This was how Mandrameen practiced religion - by moving from one religion to another, averaging out the true shape of Reality from ancient myths so distorted with age. He would consider them together, and start with their similarities instead of their differences. From this exercise he found what he believed was the core of every religion: a story to explain the existence and nature of suffering.
The Cult of the Dreamer, for example, believed that all suffering is caused by nightmares that emerge from the minds of those who still sleep in the Waking Dream. Only those who recognize the Dream for what it is - a fabrication or an illusion - can achieve Lucidity and escape these nightmares.
The Soleans believed that we were created by their gods to be slaves. Suffering comes into play because Sol and his mistress Luna intentionally created us with certain particular deficiencies which keep us angry at each other instead of angry at gods themselves. Chief among these faults were an abundance of lust (Libis), innate love for those who are kin and hatred for those who are not (Paroch), and an insatiable desire to improve our own personal status (Egos). Even kings are never happy with what they have and who they’re fucking. 
The Kalemites believed that we were once a link in the Great Chain of Being, once part of an indistinguishable whole. However, the profane lure of individuality caught a hold of one of the Number, and so this misguided soul severed its link to the Chain, spawning all life on earth, dooming us and the animals to loneliness, to an existence where our minds can never touch one another’s, to a state of being where it is possible to be lost, forgotten, and unloved.
In all this, Mandrameen believed, was something of the true shape of Reality: whether it be by accident or intention, we were designed to suffer.
The cynic Seculla was not impressed. She thought that Mandrameen’s wide study of religions was biased towards those that survived. Her calculus was simple: any religion which might preach that Paradise is here and that Peace is now would be trampled underfoot by the hordes of the suffering and damned, for they demand answers and atonement for their troubles, and a religion which preaches contentment with the present cannot give it.  
She quoted the difficulty that priests of the Dreamer had in converting the isolated tribe of Het. “They cannot see through the eyes of the Dreamer for they are not plagued by His nightmares,” one priest wrote. “Here, food is plenty. War is absent. They spend their days swimming, fishing, and building houses high in the trees. They are happy… they simply do not understand.” Two of the priests sent to convert this tribe abandoned their frocks and took up wives in that Hetian village. This was proof, to Seculla at least, that suffering was not an intrinsic part of the human condition. It comes from somewhere else.
Whether or not she is correct is a matter for theologians and philosophers. For common folk, like Pyetle, it does not matter from whence suffering comes, only that it comes too often. When his business began to fail, and when his wife took a lover, he could not console himself with thoughts of happy Hetian villagers. The only thing that could tear his mind from the look on his wife’s face as she pleaded for him to stay, was the rainstorm that caught him drunk in the streets of Jeket. 
Sol had conjured this whipping rain just to torment him, he thought. What other purpose could there be for a storm so fierce and so far out of season? Surely, it was a joke of the Gods. As Pyetle staggered and slipped along the cobbled street of the Sauline Hill, the high center of the city, he cursed Sol and all His Creation. 
“This, and this, and this, and this,” he muttered, counting his sufferings. The drink kept his blood warm and his legs moving, though he was not headed anywhere in particular. When he reached the quarried cliff of the hill, he sat down. From there he could see the city of Jeket in all its splendor.
Eight wide boulevards  spread out from the Hill in the eight directions, and they stretched far across the river plain. From these branched roads, and from these branched alleys, all ordered and angled according to the symmetry found in the Solar Fern, the plant which grows all along the banks of the Jade River. Flat and square mud brick tenements sprouted out from these stems, and scurrying amongst them were tiny specks of people. They seemed like blackflies, jumping from leaf to stem to leaf, tending to the needs of the plant which gave them shelter and life, suckling at the fruits of their labors:  The clay Pyramid of Larat. The roofless columns of the Temple of the Dreamer. The sky-eyed domes of the Solean pantheon. Each was more magnificent than the last. 
The most grand of them all, the massive granite walls which ringed the city, were distant enough from Pyetle that they seemed small. From there, a patchwork of farms and canals stretched to the banks of the Jade River, then continued on from the other side to the horizon. 
High above these distant fields, massive anvil-head thunderstorms lumbered like giants, walking on misty columns of rain. Their hearts rumbled with thunder, and their bodies blocked out the sun. All was grey save for the yellow sliver of a horizon, but that was enough to fleck the river, the canals, and flooded fields with gold. Even the rippling puddles at Pyetle’s feet sparkled. 
It was beautiful. 
Beautiful - just not meant for him. 
Jeket. The world. This beauty - no place in it for Pyetle.
“Fuck it,” he said to himself as the rain beat his back and the cold began to creep in. “It’s not worth it.”
He took the knife that he had just bought out of his pocket, unsheathed it, and cupped it's blade in the palm of his hand. It was an exquisite piece, as a thousand specks of tin had been hammered into the cherry hilt, forming a twisting, wind-like pattern. The blade itself was so finely polished that he could see his reflection in it. He could see how his eyes were red and witless, how his nose was runny, and how his cheeks were sunk and sallow. He looked older than he expected, with wrinkles and furrows and sun-spot blemishes. Older than he felt. 
The sight of his aged self transformed his feelings of despair and shame into anger, as it made visceral the notion that he had wasted his years of youth and vigor, that he had already played his hand and had lost, beaten by Nature, the Gods, and greedier, cleverer men. 
He stabbed at the puddle with his knife, then he stood up, turned his back on this privileged vista, set his shoulder against the wind and rain, and made his way to Salavan Saran’s house to kill the man who had ruined his life. 
After that, he had only to decide how he wanted to die, for he had decided against killing himself. A better way would be to wander down one of the thief infested alleys near the Heberdee Gate. One final stab in the back would be a more fitting end.


---


“Pyetle, my friend! Come in, come in,” said Salavan Saran with a smile. He was a huge man, tall and rotund, clad in a yellow robe replete with roses embroidered in pink. He beckoned Pyetle past his guards and onto his covered stoop and out of the rain. “I was beginning to wonder if you were coming,” he said. “Marta and the girls are out, so it’s just us.”
“I hope Marta was able cook a little something before she left,” said Pyetle.
“Yes, yes, I told her you were on the way,” Sal said with a chuckle. “She finished a few potstickers before she left, just for you.” 
“Your wife is Divine.”
“Indeed she is. And how is Claire?” 
Pyetle paused and removed his sandals, then stuck his feet out into the rain to wash them of mud. “Well, I took her to the Fordwell the other day,” he said.
        “Ah yes, I recall; you said you two were having some issues. Did your little sojourn through nature have the desired effect?” Sal asked.
“No.”
“I see,” said Sal as he gave little Pyetle a practiced but insincere look of concern.
The little man was a pitiful sight, so drenched and drunk as he was, with his skinny neck seeming barely able to support his weary head. 
“You’re soaking,” Salavan said, “Let me get you a towel and some clothes.”
“No, no, that’s fine, I won’t won’t be long.”
“I insist,” Salavan said, then clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out with some dry towels and a simple white tunic. Pyetle followed the boy into a washroom, dried and changed, then came out into the main hall.
As if an honored position on the Sauline Hill were not enough, Salavan’s home was nearly as large and as tall as any other in Jeket, and its opulence was second to none. It had cost Sal three siver-strings of imported lumber just to burn enough lime to make enough plaster to coat the massive walls. The rare paints for the fresco that wrapped around the open-roofed atrium took another fortune more - though it was worth it, for it was a magnificent work of art, in skill and in subject. It depicted Sol at the very moment of his apotheosis. The sun-god wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his blade jutting out from his father’s chest.
“To business then!” Salavan exclaimed as he appeared from behind Pytele, clapping him on the back and guiding him up to the second floor, where dinner awaited. As they took the stairs, Salavan tried to prepare Pyetle with some flattering remarks.
“Pyetle, you know I’ve been impressed with how you’ve handled things, considering the circumstances. Lesser men would have folded a year ago, but you’ve persisted. I value that in a partner.”
        “It couldn’t have been more perfect,” Pyetle lamented.
        “Eh?”
        “As soon as we stepped foot in the Fordwell, she must’ve said, ‘So beautiful’ at least twenty times.”
        “Ah, I see. Business can wait, I suppose.”
        “Sol could have descended in a cloud right then and there to give me his blessing. I mean it was a beautiful day.”
        “Well, so is today,” said Sal as they came up to the second floor with its high windows that offered a stunning view of the city. Protected from the rain as they were, it was all so calm and soothing. Sol himself hung just above the western horizon, peeking through the clouds, a resplendent golden orb, almost winking at them.
The furnishings of Salavan’s second story were muted and tasteful so as to pick up Sol’s light instead of overwhelm it. Here the floor was covered in massive rugs that were subtly patterned and white and trimmed with glittering gold ropes, so that they served as giant picture frames for the colors that Sol threw upon them. There were pillows upon pillows for comfort, with gold tassels and ivory lace threading them together. In one corner the floor had been carved out to accommodate a hefty hotstone, heated by the kitchen below, and it was already portioned with meats. At the sides of the stone were reclining chairs made of rope strung into angled ebony frames. Pyetle sighed as he reclined into his, then munched on a potsticker that he had pulled from the hotstone. 
“Claire has been the hardest bit for me,” Pyetle said in between bites. “The losses, the caravans, the thieves, I can handle those. But her… I invested myself into her.”
        “You two aren’t separating are you?”
Pyetle sighed. “She was cheating on me, Salavan.”
“Oh?”
        Pyetle eyed Salavan warily, trying to catch some degree of recognition or hint of worry. But Salavan was a master of his emotions.
“Pyetle, you’re in a tragic spot and I’m sorry for that,” Sal said as he lit up a wrap of freeweed before settling into his chair. “But, I’ve got to be honest - I can’t relate to what you are going through. I’ve heard stories of loves-lost and loves-lorn and I’ve tasted it a little, but, well you know that Marta and I were kids when we were married.”
“I know.”
“So,” Sal said before taking a long drag from his wrap, “I can give you financial and business advice, but what you need right now, I can’t give it to you.”
        Pyetle bit into another potsticker, and he savored the sweet peach sauce in which the shredded chicken had been baked.
“This is so good. If only I could steal Marta from you.”
“You are certainly welcome to try,” Sal said, smiling.
“I suppose I would fail.” Pyetle moaned. “It seems the only time I've really been shown intimacy is when I pay for it.” 
        “Pyetle...”
        “It’s this face. This damned body. Like my father’s - I don’t understand how he ever got a woman to stick with him.”
        “Your father was richer than I am.”
        “It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter,“ Pyetle asserted, eager not to be distracted from his endgame. 
Sal took another drag from his wrap before continuing on to his point. “Just settle for a woman that will have you for your money. You’ve not got much of it left, but any little bit of money has a way of motivating a person to look deeper into a Being. First she’ll have you for your money, and I trust, in time, she’ll have you for you.” 
        “I’ve been married to Claire for 13 years, Sal. You’re saying I should move on already?”
        Sal leaned back in his ornamented chair and folded his hands across his stomach and sighed. “You’ve spent your whole life getting what you want in the way that you want it, Pyetle, except this one thing. You’re spoiled - no, that’s not fair - You’re stubborn. Women of consequence, women like Claire, they pick up on that as soon as you open your mouth. No one wants to be stuck with a stubborn ass for a lifetime.”
        “Is that so?”
Sal had expected Pyetle to leap into defence of his character, as he usually did whenever Sal got in a personal jab. The flippancy was disturbing. Sal looked down his nose at Pyetle, and in the flickering firelight he caught the glimmer of tears streaking down his face. He looked away in disgust, and caught sight of the horizon. There, Sol’s light was dimming, the rain was letting up, and through it he could make out the evening song of Swassel birds drifting in on a cool breeze. The mood would have been delightful if it weren’t for Pyetle’s downer.
“Have some freeweed,” Sal demanded.
        “No.”
        “Pyetle, I may not know your kind of sorrow, but I’ve had my share of sorrow in general, and a wrap of freeweed blunts its edge. It’s the only thing I can offer you. Take it.”
        Pyetle wiped his eyes with the palm of his hand and tried to compose himself before taking a wrap from the tray near him. He then stood up to light it in the fire that burned above the hotstone.
        “I think this is it for me,” Pyetle said as he rolled the tip of the wrap in the flame. “I’m done. I’m finally done.”
        “What do you mean?” Sal asked.
        “You’re going to make me say it?”
        “Say what? You’re giving up?”
         Pyetle simply smiled, turned his chair to face Salavan, and sat back down to nurse his freeweed and glare at Salavan.
“Well, I’m sure you’ve considered all alternatives.”
“Alternatives...”
“Did you ever get to hear old Pella Germin speak?”
“I don’t go in for that.”
“I heard her preach once. She said that we are expected to kill ourselves.”
“Did she?”
“She said something like, ‘Corruption is a stain that does not wash off. To be free of it, to achieve peace, you must first kill yourself.’”
“You were there when she preached this?”
“I was. For a while I marked it as the ravings of a common Dreamer, especially considering what came of her. But, in time, I saw some wisdom in it. Perhaps I put the wisdom there, but it felt like I found it. So tell me, have you tried killing yourself? Figuratively, I mean.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“I guess it means, try living for a little bit as if Pyetle Pernderser were dead.”
“That’s a bit heretical, even for you.”
“No, no, no. Follow me here. From this moment on, Pyetle is dead, and residing inside 
this fleshy vessel is… whatever you want to put in there.”
        “If it were possible... I would like to rip out my heart. But I don’t think it works that way.”
        Sal leaned forward. The freeweed was working its energy into him. “Your broken heart is there because you put it there. Pyetle put it there. If you kill Pyetle, he can no longer stop you from throwing away his treasure.”
        “I put it there?”
        “Yes! You have to accept that.”
        “I was thinking it was Claire who put it there.”
        “Only because you let her.”
        “I was also thinking you put it there, Sal.”
        “Me?” Salavan asked.
        “Weren’t you the one who was fucking her?”
        Salavan’s face contorted into a quizzical look.
        “Is that what she told you?”
        “That’s what I gathered.”
        “Pyetle, you’re so goddamned stupid. You’ve been running from responsibility your whole life and now that it’s catching up to you... You… Ah, you came to kill me, didn’t you?”
        Pyetle reached into his tunic for his knife, but it wasn’t there. He had left it in wet clothes downstairs.
        “You did, didn’t you! I was wondering about this - ” Salavan held up Pyetle’s knife. “I know you’re one of those loony Dreamers who never travel armed, and so I wondered. But I thought you were just trying to kill yourself.”
        Pyetle gulped his fears in. The prospect of losing even this final encounter terrified him even more than whatever painful plans Salavan had in store.
         Salavan stood up out of his chair, and moved towards Pyetle. “I’m impressed, Pyetle. Perhaps now your eyes are being opened to the potential that lies in your still beating heart. Perhaps now you realize the Will of your own Being. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it. Perhaps it was the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing?” 
Salavan grabbed Pyetle, then threw him down to the ground. “What did you dream of, Pyetle?” Salavan shouted as he used his great bulk to wrestle Pyetle’s flailing limbs into submission. It wasn’t difficult considering Pyetle’s drunken stupor. “Was it a great and terrible crime? A radical act of charity?” Salavan put the knife up hard against Pyetle’s throat, and his large weight squeezed the air from his lungs. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here at death’s door you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this, it’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan began to choke Pyetle with his heavy hand, and Pyetle gasped for air. “Yes, I can see it! Hah! I can see it there inside of you now!” Salavan held the knife up to Pyetle’s mouth as the little man kicked. “Yes! What is about to happen here is a great crime - but it’s yours! When you pass on into the Hellespont, that should be your final thought, that you let it come to this, you let your Will stagnate, and here I am,” Salavan declared, “about to take it from you. Because I can!” 
        Before Salavan could plunge the knife into Pyetle’s throat, an arrow whizzed in pierced his hand.
        “EAAAUUUGHHH!” Salavan screamed, dropping the knife. Pyetle pulled himself out from under Sal’s weight, and wriggled up against the wall. There at the window was a man, a giant man, massive even when compared to Salavan, yet lanky and coordinated. In his hand was a bow that was nearly as tall as he.
        “Thief! Brigand!” Salavan yelled, clutching at his pierced hand.
        “Scream all you like, Salavan,” said the giant at the window. “None of your house is alive to hear you.”
Salavan went silent, then scrambled to his feet and ran towards the stairs, but he stopped when he saw that it was blocked by another dark figure. Sal stumbled backwards, then turned and faced the intruder with defiance.
“Take what you will and be gone!” he shouted.
The giant just laughed, “I plan to. But first, do you know who I am?” 
Salavan eyed the man up and down to get his measure. A man of such stature could only be the famous Giant of the Junei. “You’re Ayram. We’ve done business.”
“We’ve recently done business,” the giant pointed out, “and you didn’t hold up your end of the bargain.”
“What do you mean?”
“The information you gave the go-between was bad. My people -” he said, nodding to whoever was at the stairs, “have got it in their heads that you set us up.” Salavan looked behind him, and a short, squat figure all wrapped in black came up the stairs, blade drawn, pointed at Salavan’s ass. 
“What!?” Salavan exclaimed. “I never would - why would I do that!? I’ve nothing to gain by doing that. There’s only the-”
“Yes,” the giant interrupted. “I was thinking the same, Sal. Getting me to pick off your competitors is certainly more valuable than anything the Empire could offer you. So there’s got to be something deeper going on.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“Maybe you don’t. It could be that someone funneled bad information to you, knowing you would funnel it to me. In which case, where did you get the information from.”
“You know that I’m the exchequer for the mining guild. I have access to all of the -”
“That wasn’t a mining column, Sal.”
“What?”
“That was a column of Imperial cavalry, Sal.”
“What?” Sal asked, before letting out a shrill “EAUGGHH” as the short figure behind him prodded in between his buttcheeks with his sword.
“I have no idea what you’re -”
“I think you do! You knew there was a Mensan among them, didn’t you.”




“Yes, but do you know anymore. Don’t lie to me. I’ll know if you’re lying.”
“
        “Burning Gods, bless this stupid man with light.” Grabs him by the shoulders. “You’re right, Pyetle, you’re right. No one - and I do mean no one - cares about you. If you kill yourself tomorrow, the rest of us here will be back in our routines within a month. For me, your memory will bring a pang of ill-humor now and then, but I’ll muddle through. So do it. Kill yourself. But do it in such a way that your corporeal body can be used for something greater. If you hollow out your Being you might even become an instrument for the Divine. Offer your body up as a tool for the Gods if you’ve no more use for it.”
“Closter Germin taught this?”
“Gods, man!”
        Sal released Pyelte. “Life has put you on a path, Pyetle. Unfair as it may be, it does not lead to the Plenitude. I just think you owe it to yourself, this one final</Text>

            <Text>The garden holds a sacred place in Solitant cosmology. Every distinguished person who is looking to appear the part has one. Mandri had seen his fair share. He’d walked under the royal palms of Skriniar, and he’d seen the terraced falls of Luzee. None of them compared to Salavan’s garden, not because Salavan’s was better, they just weren’t comparable. All those other gardens were thirsty greenscapes, accented here and there by vibrant splashes of flower, fruit, and the glow of the atmosphere reflecting off the surface of a placid, artificial lake. Salavan’s garden was a garden of stone. Mandri never heard of a garden composed entirely of curated stone. When he stepped through Salavan’s gate and onto a plane of bone-white pebbles, he gasped.
It was a true garden. It obeyed all the rules a young artist learns when scribbling out compositions for clients. First and foremost is to establish a hierarchy of form; if there are stones they’ve got to come in different sizes: big, medium, and small, at the very least. Arrange them in such a way so as to draw the eye, or in this case, a person, through a maze of perception and towards what is important. It was about contrast. Most rules of thumb in art have to do with manipulating contrast. Sharp against soft. Dark against light. Many against few. Big against little. Here, a rippling sea of smooth white pebbles bounced up against jagged knots of gray granite, granite which grew in size towards the center of this snow-white field of stone. In the very center stood a towering spike of Fabled Black.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. Outside of the Jeket’s cavern temples, he’d only seen tiny fragments of Fabled Black in satin lined boxes, resting on pillows, shielded by glass. Here was an jagged obelisk of it, and it was as tall and as wide as any of the four-story sandstone columns that held up the roof of the great mansion behind.
Fabled Black. The skewering stone. A shard of the firmament. The quintessence of night. If it were a tree, and the pebbles, grass, and the granite, bushes, it all would have been too deliberate—a stilted garden, devoid of the dynamism and spontaneity one sees in Nature. But this was a god-killing stone, and so the stasis, the absence of life, that was the point.
Mandri walked up to the black obelisk. He saw his own reflection in its surface sheen split by streaks of rain. He looked worse than he’d ever been; eyes red and witless, face gaunt and sallow, lips cracked, and his sodden hair clung to tight to his meatless skull. He looked like death. Perhaps everyone who looked into the depths of Fabled Black looked like death.
He lamented the absence of his burgeon beer.
A man’s voice rose out of the ether behind him.
“The stone makes the most wondrous pigment.”
Mandri spun around, and standing five feet behind him was a massive man who stood two heads taller than himself and had a barrel of a chest was easily thrice the size of his own. The man was was draped in a white silk robe, and his face was Jandrian through and through: high cheeks, a strong brow, and narrow eyes. The only outlier was his hair; no beard, and instead of the usual scruff of Jandri black, it was as white as his robe, or the rocks under his feet.
He didn’t look like a demon, though Mandri couldn’t be sure, as his burgeonsight was dimming. Nothing was twisting the man’s genteel airs. He looked so prim and proper because he kept his great bulk out of the rain through the use of a tiny, black-lacquered umbrella.
This large man looked past Mandrameen towards the obelisk and said, “It makes a black that rivals the crow.”
Mandri snuck a look behind at the spire of Fabled Black. He wanted to ask how this man had come into possession of such a thing, and why he dared to keep it outdoors. A spire of Fabled Black like this must be worth a mountain.
“I am Salavan,” the man said. “And you are the great Mandrameen.”
Mandri said, “That’s me.”
Salavan said, “I love your work. I was hoping that, some day, you would find your way to my door, and here you are.”
Mandri spread his arms out wide to present himself. “Here I am.”
“I see you’ve found my stone.”
Salavan walked up next to Mandri and set his meaty hand upon the spike of Fabled Black, caressing it, as if it were a child.
“It is incredible isn’t it?” he said. “Yet it is only a small sliver of the comet which buried Solraheen.”
“I would ask how it got here, but I suspect I know the answer.”
“It isn’t stolen, if that’s what you are getting at. I paid for it. Paid for it with bribes, nonetheless I paid for it. Provisions for the smuggling alone cost me thirty-five silver strings.”
“I see.”
Salavan grimaced at the air of judgment in Mandri’s tone. He said, “So what if that money went to poorer people than it was supposed to. Maybe we can say it was an act of charity. Charity for the people who moved it, and charity for the thing itself. A stone such as this belongs in a place of prominence, not shuttered away in some dim Jeketian cave. Here, it is out in the air, where it belongs. You can touch it if you like.”
“No thanks.”
“You’re right, there’s no need.” Salavan pulled his hand away from the rock. “Merely being in its presence is enough.”
Mandri’s eyes ran up the stone’s spine and he shuddered. Fabled Black was notorious for its dark aura. A small shard of it could make the happiest child feel chill and rotten. Here in such quantity, that feeling crept down to the bone.
Salavan followed Mandri’s gaze and said, “Isn’t it strange that everything that falls from the sky should radiate sadness? Rain and Fabled Black? Either the heavens are a void of a despair and these elemental things are infused with it, or in the grand scheme of the universe, this earth is a supremely disappointing place, and so things cast down upon it radiate a longing to be somewhere else…Would you say that’s what you feel right now? A longing to be somewhere else?”
“You could say that.”
“Don’t be so glib, Mandri. Consider—wouldn’t the rain prefer to dance in the clouds? Wouldn’t this stone rather gird the stars than be stuck here in the ground? You see, the Black is alive. In a very real sense, it is alive, and I can’t wait to show you what it can do. Would you like to see?”
Salavan spared Mandri a beneficent smile. His teeth were as white as Pell’s. They did not sparkle, for some strange force—the stone, the long march up the hill, or salavan himself—was pushing the burgeons out of Mandri’s sight and his mind back into sobriety. 
Mandri said, “I don’t have a choice, do I?”
“What gave you that idea?”
“Pell said that if I didn’t come and see you, she would kill me.”
“She said exactly that?”
“Yes.”
“And here you are, seeing me, yes?”
“Yes.”
“Then you have fulfilled that obligation.”
Mandri was stunned by the cold sense of it. It was too legalistic. A demon-witch didn’t seem like the kind of creature to care about the strict definitions of words. There was something more he was supposed to do here. It wasn’t enough to simply see the man. He imagined Pell ripping out his innards as he screamed, “But I did what you said, I saw him!” 
 “Mandri, I won’t have this tension in my house. You are safe here, and you are free to leave at any time. Or, if you are at all curious about what may lay in store for you, then say it, and we shall find it out together.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
Salavan chuckled and said, “Yes, I am aware. Would you like to come inside?”
Mandri nodded, but Salavan scowled back. “Assert yourself,” he said brusquely. “I won’t have any of this meekness in my house either. Stand up straight if you can. Goodness. You look like you were born yesterday.”
“Whatever.”
Salavan scrunched up his big round face like he’d just smelled something foul “That’s not much better,” he said, “but it will have to do. Come.”
 Salavan skirted around Mandri and past the spike of Fabled Black. The way he moved, it was dainty and deliberate, completely at odds with his massive size. He was careful to keep the hem of his robe out of any puddles, and his umbrella was so small that he couldn’t walk at stride without the rain splashing his legs, so he sort of shuffled across his stone yard, looking to Mandri like a great white pig tiptoeing its way through a briar patch. 
Mandri followed, and once he was under the roof of the mansion’s grand portico, Salavan gave him a well-practiced look of concern.
“You’re soaked,” Salavan said, “A towel and a change of clothes.”
Salavan clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out of the mansion’s servant door, carrying a towel and a white linen tunic. Mandri was dried and fitted with the tunic, which ended at the knees, then he and Salavan proceeded on inside.
“Do you like my home?” Salavan said. “It cost me fifty silver strings to import the lumber to burn the lime for the plaster, and that was just for the outer wall. This interior, the plaster, the paints, that cost… well, I don’t want to go on and on about expenses.”
Salavan gave a smug and self-aware smile that said that bragging about expenses was exactly he wanted to do. 
Was the house extravagant? Yes.
Was it impressive? Mandri didn’t think so.
Unlike the garden outside, the place met expectations. Mandri could have been standing inside any number of the miniature palaces that scabbed the Hrkan world. Tall arched ceilings. Wide halls. Skinny walls. Sparsely decorated. Everything white. No lamps, or torches, for fear the soot might stain that whiteness. Only natural light, Solraheen’s light, was allowed in. Today that natural light was a rainy grey, and that didn’t do much to illuminate the vast interior. It was dark, and stark, and empty—again, not unusual, for the austerity, the whiteness, was a religious expression of sorts. White is the most sacred color. White for the all-white spark. True White does not exist in the material world, save for the glow of Solraheen, but in the Hrkan expression of the Solitant religion claims that it is a pious thing to strive for pure whiteness. The ostentation of color was to be abhorred, unless it was bounded by a frame. Art, painting, these were sacred things too, but the building itself had to be silent, for it was said that Solraheen would refuse to dwell in a place that presumed to outshine him. 
But piety is no constraint on the rat race of the rich. The cleanliness, the whiteness, the starkness, these were the rules of the competition. The richness of scale was a ___. How tall is your ceiling? How much emptiness can you afford to horde? Judge the floor; a rich man could afford to have a white floor because he could afford to employ a person or persons to wipe up the filth of feet. Salavan’s floor was as white as the sway-away ceiling, and as he and Mandri walked along, a girl was crouching behind with bowl of water and a brush, scrubbing away.
Salavan said, “How do you find my home?”
“Very clean,” said Mandri.
“Yes. Perhaps you will find my gallery stimulating. I’ve some pieces here that you won’t see anywhere else—but that goes without saying.”
“Any of those stolen?”
The accusation put a hitch in Salavan’s step, and he seemed a little too eager to show amusement.
“None of them are stolen. Aside from that shard of Fabled Black, I’ve acquired everything I own through perfectly legal means. I even have something of yours here. One of your best works, I think.”
“Spare me.”
“Don’t be modest, Mandri. I won’t have it. Not in this house.”
Salavan clapped his hands and another servant came forth from some narrow orifice, carrying a shallow bowl lined with finger-length wraps of freeweed.
Salavan said, “If paintings aren’t your pleasure, how about a wrap?”
Mandri said, “I don’t know if you can tell, but I’m coming down off of burgeons right now.”
Salavan seemed genuinely surprised. “You are remarkably lucid,” he said. “You do have that hopeless look about you, but I supposed that was, you know, the general malaise of the indigent.”
Salavan selected a wrap for himself, put it in a pocket inside his robe, and waved the servant away. 
He said, “Freeweed doesn’t mix well with burgeons, does it? We shall skip the freeweed, and we’ll skip the gallery tour. You came here for a purpose, after all.”
“About that,” Mandri said. “I can tell you right now that I’m not a—”
Salavan stopped him mid-sentence with a polite wave of his hand. He said, “You cannot tell me anything. I should say that I know more about you than you know about yourself.”
“Bullshit.”
“No, no bullshit.”
“What’s my mother’s name?”
Salavan sneered and said, “I don’t pollute my mind with such trifles. The knowledge I have is more fundamental. Do you know a lizard’s mother’s name? No. Do you know more about a lizard than it knows about itself? Yes. Believe me when I say that you and every other god-lost person don’t understand the first thing about what you truly are.” 
Mandri sighed. Salavan was no demon king, just another religious kook. A rich one. Mandri wasn’t sure if he’d rather prefer the demon.
Salavan said, “I can see that you are going to need it explained to you. Come. We must study at least one piece of art. Come.”
Salavan led Mandri through a series of rooms, each with a ceiling higher than the one before. Common to the fashion of the Hrkan elite, what few furnishings there were, were muted. If there was a table, it was carved from a rough, pale sandstone. If there was a chair, its legs were simple, sanded branches, and its seat was woven reed. If there was a tapestry, it was devoid of color and image, for its purpose was to be a frame for the subtleties of Solraheen’s light—which there wasn’t much of. These rooms were cold and dark. Blueish-grey.
Eventually, Salavan led him into a cavernous room that had circular cutout in it’s roof. Rain and sunlight streamed down through it to pitter-patter in was a shallow rainwater pool on the floor. All edges of the room were laden with pillows upon pillows for comfort, all white with white tassels and stuffed inside ivory lace pillow cases.
On the other side of the column of rain was fresco that spanned across the entirety of the wall. It was this to which Salavan had set his eyes.
It was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Solraheen at the very moment of his apotheosis—he was stretched out, as if flying, and his face was a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as he plunged it into his brother’s—Schisol’s—back. In the classic Hrkan style, Solraheen was pure white, and Schisol was an ashy black. The army of people surrounding them were cast in every color imaginable.
“This is my favorite piece.” Salavan said contentedly. “For sentimental reasons, mostly. It has so much behind it, if you know what I mean.”
“I don’t”
“See this yellow, isn’t it beautiful?”
He was pointing to the golden rays which emanated out from Solraheen’s head. It really was a fantastic yellow, extraordinarily vibrant, as if it had been painted on mere moments ago.
Salavan asked, “Can you guess the pigment?”
Mandri said, “I have no idea.”
“This yellow, it comes from the Gabo cow. Incredibly expensive. The most wasteful pigment imaginable. To make enough for this fresco I had to buy three men to care for fifty cows. I had to put them on a strict diet, the cows. They couldn’t eat anything but this little squeaking bug, called a zuberant. They look like locusts, but they’re the size of your thumb, well, my thumb.”
“I’ve seen them.”
“They come in hives so they aren’t too expensive. You make a paste out of them and feed this paste to the cows, and you have to stuff their bellies full all at once. That means you’ve got to starve them a bit so they take to that bug-paste like dogs to the bone. Then you have to time the next step just right, because, see, this radiant pigment comes from the chyme of the cow’s second stomach, so you have to be precise with the cutting. You have wait until the chyme extrudes into that second stomach, not the first or third stomach, the second stomach, and that’s when you cut open the beast and harvest as much this yellow chyme as you can. You dry it out into a powder, and that is that.”
“Interesting.”
“Once you have the chyme, you can sell the meat. But I don’t sell the meat. I let it rot in the sun.”
“Why?”
“Because it feels…” Salavan waved his hand in the air as if to catch the words that could accurately describe what he was thinking. “It feels weighty to have killed a herd of beasts for the explicit purpose of painting my wall. Doesn’t Solraheen look radiant? And now that you know fifty cows died to make it seem so, doesn’t that make the fresco take on a more…I can’t find the words.”
“It doesn’t do anything for me.”
Salavan’s round face lit up and he laughed. “Hah! It doesn’t do anything, does it! Maybe not. It is only a color after all. It is what it is, doesn’t matter where it came from. Yet the image is fine, no? The quality of the painting is sublime, yes?”
“Sure.”
“Don’t be flippant, Mandri. It is beautiful. This is Ellag’s hand. I trust you are familiar with her work?”
“I am.”
“You know, she’s here. Would you like to see her?”
“Not really, no.”
“Unfortunate, because seeing her is the first step in our journey. I trust Pell told you what this is all about?”
“Not really no. Something about a god who doesn’t exist.”
“Asharaheen. Do you know who he is?”
“No.”
“But you do! You know him by a different name. You know him as Schisol.”
Salavan pointed again to the fresco, to the face the black god being stabbed by Solraheen.
“You worship the evil one?”
“Schisol—Asharaheen—he is not evil.”
Mandri looked at the fresco again. Schisol’s horns and shrieking eyes were a stark contrast to Solraheen’s resplendence.
“He looks evil to me,” said Mandri.
“Yes, well, I must keep up appearances. Imagine a Hrkan prince striding into my hall and discovering me to be a heretic. That would be the end of me, wouldn’t it? To defend the good, we followers of Asharaheen must cloak ourselves in Solitant ways.”
“Defend the good?”
“Yes, we are on the side of good.”
“Pell ripped out Gil’s stomach.”
“Who is Gil?”
“My ox.”
“What is bad about killing an ox? Have you never cooked a slab of tripe?”
“She didn’t eat the stomach. She ate his spark.”
Salavan’s brows raised.
“You mustn’t judge her, Mandri.”
Mandri looks at him like he’s insane.
“I saw what I saw.”
“I don’t deny that you did, but Mandri, but you did not understand what you saw. Pell was not, as they say, consuming that spark for sustenance. It is amazing how a shameless twist of truth written down a few thousand years ago can become a foundational pillar of belief. It goes right down to the core of it. Even the story of how Solraheen came to be buried under the earth is a lie.”
“Nonsense. I’ve been to Jeket.”
“They let you see Him?”
“No…but I know He’s there.”
“He is there, yes, crushed under all that rock and Fabled Black. But unlike you, I have been allowed into those caves, and I have glimpsed His face, and I’ll tell you, He did not look pleased with His situation.”
“Why would He? He’s crushed under a comet.”
“But you should see what they do to Him, Mandri. They inundate his air with deadening fumes. They carve slivers from his regenerative flesh to fuel their abominations.”
“You mean the Mazydai?”
“I mean abominations. Think of it, Mandri, if it weren’t for the power of the Mazydai, the Hrks would never have conquered the outland tribes. This story that you’ve heard, that a stone of night fell from the sky and Solraheen saved the world by absorbing its obliterating blow with his body, well, it is simple and neat, but is it the truth? No.”
Salavan put his fat finger up on the fresco, and he poked he Schisol’s belly, right where Soloraheen’s sword burst forth.
A click sounded out from under the floor, and a square of stone levered open to reveal a narrow stairway descending into darkness. 
Salavan said, “Before we head down, I must demand from you your utmost commitment. I, unlike the Solitants, value honesty, so my good character compels me to warn you that there is a chance—a chance—that as we attempt to divine your role in the divine plan, you will die. It’s only a chance, and a small one at that. I want you to consider the thought before you join me.”
Salavan hiked up the hem of his robe, and disappeared down into the stairs.
Mandri stared down into that inky blackness, and not a thought went through his head. He must have stared for quite a while, because Salavan’s voice echoed up, saying, “I said consider the thought, not inhabit it.”
As Mandri stepped down the stairs, a servant girl bustled out some narrow passage and closed the hatch behind him.
At the bottom of the stairs was a short tunnel, and at the end of this tunnel was a cramped room. In this room, set up against the far wall, a fire in a bronze brazier. There were three wooden chairs. Sitting in one of them was a person draped in sheet. Sitting in the chair next to it, was Salavan.
“Don’t look so pale, Mandri. I told you not to come down here if you weren’t committed. You’re here, and now you’re here. Do you understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Sit down.” 
Mandri took the remaining seat, across from Salavan and the veiled stranger.
Salavan pulled the wrap of freeweed from his pocked, and he lit it in the brazier’s flames. He puffed it thrice to get it going.
“So!”. He said as he clapped his hands. “Are you the Eunuch Painter? The Painted Eunuch? Or is it simply, the painter who doesn’t want to be a painter? You’d be surprised about how many of those we find.”
Salavan puffed on his wrap.
“Are your wits here, Mandri? Are you here?”
Mandri nodded.
“Use your voice. Assert yourself.”
Mandri cleared his throat and said, “Who is that?”
“As I’ve said already, it is possible that you could die. Ellag died. I keep her around for the purpose of demonstration, and I think, her presence will help put you into the right frame of mind.”
“That’s Ellag?”
Salavan’s chair creaked as he laid back into it. He blew a puff of smoke out the side of his mouth, as if the smoke could go anywhere in this cramped room. Between the freeweed and the fire, Mandri was having a hard time finding a clean breath.
Salavan crossed his tree-trunk legs and said, “Tell me, Mandri, what do you think Art is? If you could define it. Define Art.”
Mandri wondered what Salavan was getting at.
He said, “Art is whatever you want it to be.”
“Don’t be coy, Mandri. This is important. You must be eased into the right frame of mind before we move on to weightier things.”
“I just don’t think it’s an interesting question, and I’m more concerned about what’s under that sheet.”
“Is that why you don’t want to paint anymore, you think it’s uninteresting?”
“More or less.”
“Which is it, more, or less? Be specific. You’ve spent too much time in front of an easel not to have some idea of what it is that you are doing.”
“I make pretty pictures.”
Salavan rolled his eyes and took a long drag from his wrap. He held the smoke in his great big chest, and when he finally exhaled, his round shoulders slumped like the essence life was leaving him.
“You think Art is merely a word,” he said. “You think that it’s a label that people slap onto things for utility.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“Then say something. I’m trying help you avoid ending up like Ellag here.”
Salavan puts his arm around Ellag’s shoulder and gave her body a friendly shake. Her sheeted head rolled limply and then settled into the crook of Salavan’s shoulder as if she were looking to cuddle. As she did, the sheet pulled taught over her face, and as it did, a smear of blood welled up to stain the fibers.
Salavan narrowed his eyes and glared at Mandrameen. The air between them swirled with the smoke of tension. 
Salavan said, “Answer the gods-damned question.”
“Is she dead?”
“Of course she’s dead. Answer the question.”
“What was the question?” 
Salavan sighed, then he steadied Ellag back onto her own chair so that he could lean forward and free his hands for explanation. He said, “Ellag thought that art was about the artist. A person goes out into the world and has some incredible experience—like you’re having now. It changes them in some important, fundamental way. They are a different person because of it. They look at the world differently. But how could any of their friends or family know that any of this has occurred? The change is internal. It is not written on the skin. There’s no new sparkle in the eye. Their behavior might be different, but that will never communicate the depth of what is going on inside the mind. Consider a woman crying—for what reason does she cry? She tells you her child has died, but you’ve never had a child, Mandri, so how could you understand? This is the problem which Art purports to solve. A work of art is an attempt to break through that impenetrable barrier between our minds.”
Not one word of that made it into Mandri’s ear. He was too focused on how excited Salavan was to speak. The man was so wrapped up in his words, and in the freeweed’s smoke, that Mandri wondered if he could make a dash for the stairs.
Salavan said, “That’s what Ellag thought. She thought that art is a thing an artist does to let everyone else to know what’s going on inside.”
Mandri nodded along.
“Does that make sense?”
“It’s very sentimental.”
“Isn’t it? Sentimental, yes, that would be a word for it. Unfortunately, it is completely and utterly wrong. Look how wrong it can be.”
Seb bent down, grabbed the foot of Ellag’s sheet, and in one quick flourish, he flipped it over the back of her chair to reveal her corpse.
Her dead head bobbed and settled, and as it did a trickle of blood dripped out of the empty sockets that had once held her eyes. The belly of her tunic had been ripped apart, while the belly itself had been carved open with surgical care—skin folded back like a book to reveal a cavity under her ribs. The firelight flickered inside. Mandri could see her spine. She was hollowed out. 
“Steady, Mandri. Steady yourself… Now, looking at Ellag, you might be wondering what I am attempting to communicate with this work of art. You might think that I think that I am the artist, and that this,” he put his hand on Ellag’s skull and twisted it about in a perverse display of puppetry. “This is me communicating to you in a way that lets you experience, in a profound way, who I am and what it’s like to be me.”
He let go of Ellag’s head, and it slumped down onto her collarbone.
“But that would be a misunderstanding. Consider—why isn’t speech, casual, conversational speech like we’re having now, why isn’t that considered to be Art? I am manipulating my throat, tongue, teeth, and lips to shape a string of sounds for you to experience. Sentences are things that can to break down that barrier between our minds, yes?”
At this point the freeweed was having it’s way with Salavan. His arm’s gesticulations were growing frenetic. He cut the air with a slicing hand and said, “No. I am not an artist. I am many things, but I am not an artist.”
“You’re a murderer.”
“I’m not a murderer, either.”
Salavan took another big drag from from his freeweed. The room was so small, and the smoke was so thick, that Mandri supposed it was getting to him too.
“Actually,” Salavan said, “that’s not true, I am a murderer. But I think you’re referring to Ellag, here. I did not kill Ellag. She died because she thought painting was about the artist. She thought that the painter was important. Like you, she thought far too much of herself.” He was now churning his words in the air with his free hand, as if mixing his musings with the smoke would bring out some flavor of the truth.
“You’re insane,” said Mandri.
“It is good that you should say that. Ellag was never able to make that step. She was too…she was too wrapped up in herself. Frightened.” He jumped forward a little in his seat. “If you look into the dark when you’re frightened, you’re bound to see frightening things.” 
Salavan made an explosion with his fingers, pretending to burst his eyes.
“Her eyes exploded?” Mandri asked.
“They did. It was fascinating.”
“What about her stomach?”
“Oh. That was me. All done after the fact, I assure you. Pell wanted to query the girl’s stomach. But we shouldn’t get distracted. I think you are about where you need to be.” He poked these words with his wrap of freeweed, shaking a clump of ash free from the glowing tip.
Salavan eyed his wrap with some concern, then stood up, set it gently down onto the corner of his seat, and then sauntered off into the corner of the room that was hidden by Ellag’s shadow. He bent down and picked up a huge square stone slab which was as black as the darkness in which it sat. Salavan struggled with it for moment, then propped it up against his thighs and waddled it over. He set it down carefully at Mandri’s feet, and then he shuffled back into the dark to fetch three three clay jars. He set these down next to the black stone panel. In each jar was a black paint.
Salavan pulled from his robe a paintbrush. Its handle was short, half as long as Mandri’s forearm, short, at least, compared to the length of the head, which was about the same length. It looked more like a miniature whip than a paintbrush. Salavan handed it to Mandri and said, “I want you to use these paints to paint a picture.”
“Of what?”
“Don’t think about what you are painting. Don’t give yourself that privilege. Don’t think about what should or shouldn’t be. You need to simply start painting.”
“You want me to figure things out as I go?”
“No. No. Don’t figure anything out. You are merely a tool. True art creates itself. It is reckoned with on its own terms. It is its own experience. It communicates nothing but what it is. You kneel here—” Salavan rubbed the floor in front of Mandri with his foot. “And you become the tool by which the work creates itself.”
Mandri squinted in confusion. None of that made a lick of sense. If he thought about nothing, then he would paint nothing. Even if he wanted to paint something, it would be hopeless, because in this dim light he wouldn’t be able to see what he was doing. And there were only the three black paints to put on a black slab of rock.
Better get it over with. Swirl some paint and maybe Salavan would let him leave.
He knelt down and thought about what he should do.
With no pallette, the stone itself would have to be the pallette. It wasn’t like he was going to run into trouble mixing paints if the only color was black. One by one one, he picked up the clay jars and poured their contents onto the stone surface. The only difference between these paints, it seemed, was their viscosity. The first paint came out of its jar in a clump. It plopped onto the canvas like a sandy gel. Mandri could see the little granules of Fabled Black sparkling in the firelight. The next paint was a clean, syrupy goo that drizzled out of the jar. The last paint was so thin that he had to be careful pouring it out, lest it splash all over the place. Thankfully, the surface of the stone was ever so slightly bowled.
When Mandri was done with all this, he cast a side-eyed glance at Salavan to see if the man approved of what he was doing.
Salavan leered over him and said, “Don’t look at me, look at the work.”
Mandri looked at the work.
It was black. What else could it be?
He couldn’t shake the feeling that there was something specific he was supposed to do, a certain behavior that Salavan was looking for, and if Mandri didn’t do it, he wouldn’t be allowed to leave.
But how could he define a thing with black on black on black?
He poked the long-haried brush into the sandy gel and spread it around. It did not mix with the other paints, it pushed right through them, and the thinner paints in turn flooded into the grooves left by the brush’s passing.
Mandri sat back on his heels and studied the whirl he’d made. 
He noticed how the sheen of the orange firelight played with the different paints. It would stick softly to the fine grained gel, it would stipple the syrupy fluid, and it hardly touched the thinnest paint. Wherever the thinnest paint pooled, the image was truly black.
Mandri began to push and pull the paints around to build an image out of the light, as a sculptor might build an image out of shadows. He didn’t much care about what he was making, the brush hairs were too long and too limp to be too deliberate.
What was he making?
Black pools welled up like the hollows of human eyes.
A face, why not?
A stripe of shadow for the upper lip.
Mound up the gel to bring out the cheeks.
It was coming along.
A long and narrow face.
Gaunt.
Mandri swirled the brush around in an eye socket, trying to find an eye.
Suddenly, there it was, an eye of firelight.
It blinked.
Mandri startled backwards in fright. Then he gathered his wits and peered disbelievingly down at that fire-flickering eye.
The thinnest black ran down below the upper lip, opening the mouth, drawing Mandri’s eye.
Was there a tongue in there? A black snake of a tongue glinting in back the throat?
Yes. There it was.
“Do you see this?” Mandri asked, but no response came.
He looked up to see what Salavan was doing, but Salavan was not there. Neither was the dead woman. Neither were the chairs, or the walls, there was only Mandri, the fire, the face, and the void.
He scrambled backwards on all fours.
The face emerged from black stone dripping Fabled Black.
A whole head, fully in the round.
It was looking at Mandri.
Mandri screamed.
No sound came out.
A unseen hand grasped his throat.
Mandri closed his eyes willed himself to be somewhere else.
When he opened his eyes again, he was stunned to see that he was back in Salavan’s basement. It was Salavan’s hand on his throat, and it was Salavan’s face was hovering over his own.
“What did you see?” Salavan asked.
Mandri’s brow was pouring with sweat. 
“I saw—I saw a face.”
Salavan studied the painted slab, then muttered a single, breathless word: “Incredible...”
He turned his attention back to Mandri.
“There’s one last test,” he said.
He began to squeeze Mandri’s throat. His hand was powerful. Mandri’s throat collapsed under the pressure.
“Hold still, Mandrameen! Hold still!”
Salavan stuck his great elbow into Mandri’s stomach and leaned his great weight into it, squeezing the air from Mandri’s lungs. Tears streamed down Mandri’s face and his chest burned in agony.
Salavan’s plump smile savored every wheeze.
“There’s no greater feeling,” he muttered.
A few juddered moments later, and Mandrameen was dead.

            <Title>Exchange</Title>
            <Text>The first floor of the tower was nearly as dark as a cave, composed of a single hallway running north to south, and in the middle of this hall, on either side, were sets of wide oaken double doors that opened up into large dust-strewn storage rooms that nothing in them but stone pillars. At the end of the hall was a staircase.
The second floor was a single room, pillars included, and four paces around the circumference, there was a narrow window. Scant rays of light filtered in through the slits in the eastern side, while the views through the windows to the west were obstructed by the forms of Ayramun jostling to get a better look at the Hrkan horse and rider as they trotted towards their leader on the sand below. 
Mandri watched all this from the staircase. Once he was ready, he ducked down into the dark of the first floor to dab one meager droplet of juice from the God’s Eye burgeon onto his tongue. No more than that; the idea was to escape, not end up catatonic like before. He then plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a tightly rolled scrap of woolen rag, and he stuffed the thing in his pocket for later. If he rationed it carefully, he could make it last a week. Then, maybe, he could steal another.
He sat down on the fourth stair-step and waited there in the dark for the burgeon-sight to take hold. He knew it wouldn’t take long.
Purl got to him first.
“Where’s Mandri?”, she asked from above.
Mandri couldn’t hide his disappointment when he said, “I’m here! I’m here.”
Not wanting to seem , he stood up, and climbed up rest of the stairs to be with the others.
Out of the four Ayramun, Purl was the only one who wasn’t glued to the western window. She was sitting against the eastern wall, still strapped into her pack.  
“Don’t take it off,” Purl said to him when she noticed he was wanting to be rid of his own pack. 
“Why not?”
“We need to be ready to run.
“It only takes a second to put it on.”
“Leave it on.”
“Fine,” said Mandri, and he plopped himself down right next Purl, pack and all.
He leaned into her and said, “Do you have any idea how we’re supposed to get out of this?”
“Ayram has a plan.”
“Didn’t seem like it to me. His words, if I recall, were, ‘I’ll figure it out’.”
“No, when he says that it’s because he knows we won’t like the plan.”
“Seems like he’s winging it to me.”
“Why are sweating?”
“I’m stressed. And my pack is heavy.”
“But it’s cool in here.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t know.”
Was supposed the heartbeat was the burgeon. A half-whimpered sigh.
“Are you sad about Obo?”, Purl asked.
“What?”
“The first time I saw Obo, I watched him kill thirty Ayramun, and if you asked me then if it was possible that I could feel anything for someone who did something like that, I would have smacked you in the face for suggesting it.”
“But you can’t bring yourself to blame him, can you?”
“It’s infuriating.”
Mandri sank lower into his pack. It was quite comfy.
“The thing that gets me is that I feel guilty,” he said. “There’s nothing I could have done for him, so why do I feel guilty?”

Mandri sighed and looked up at the ceiling. He said, “Life sucks. I can’t think of one person who isn’t miserable.”
“God, you’re so dumb.”
“Who do you think has it good?”
“Most people who aren’t us.”
“The most miserable sap I've ever seen was a Hrkan prince named Jadeen. I looked into his eyes and it was like he was already old, and it wasn't a ‘just-happy-to-be-here’ old, it was that joyless, ‘I-wish-I-could-be-you’ old.”
“I bet those pilgrims on those poles downstairs would prefer to be Jadeen.”
“Okay, yes, there’s levels to misery, but that doesn’t change the fact that everyone is some kind of miserable.”
“I think you are miserable, and you're putting it on everyone else.&quot;
&quot;I am not. 
“Your eyes look different.”
Mandri blanched at the remark. Not only was she sniffing out his burgeons, but she’d spent enough time noticing his eyes to notice the difference.


Mandri was struck with a sudden burst of what can only be called inspiration.
He wanted to paint the scene.
This urge was as sudden and as uncompromising as the fussiest hunger. Inspiration sometimes imposes that , though Mandri hadn’t felt the urge in years so he wasn’t sure that this was the exactly same thing as inspiration, whatever ancient philosopher had coined the term might be able to say, but as Mandri saw it, inspiration was never as vivid as this. It had never planted him so firmly in the present as now, for he was filled completely with the sudden appreciation for how the world had conspired to bring that scribe, Ayram, and Mazyd Obo together, and how he was there too, just the man to capture the scene, just so happened to be at an angle which gave the three figures a pyramidal compositional frame; the scribe oh his horse, and Ayram, and Obo on the ground bridging the gap between them, and underneath these dry facts was a girding of symbolism - only it wasn’t symbolism at all, because symbolism is what artists do when they’ve got nothing interesting to say, but this composition here was a living, breathing arrangement, put together by a divine hand, so it could hardly be said to be symbolism. Symbolism is always a kind of fantasy, but this scene here was a message.
The scribe, this Hrkan man, did not represent Hrkan power sitting up on its high horse, he was that power, and Ayram, standing tall and proud, was not a symbol of the outland peoples he was their paragon, and in between them was Mazyd Obo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of men in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked as the two men looked on with satisfied, if challenging, glares.
If he Mandri had only had the materials, he would have dropped everything and started sketching. The thing about these moments is that if they aren’t sketched as you see them, Mandri knew if he didn’t sketch it he would not remember. these things never persist in the mind. As soon as attention breaks the is lost. One night’s sleep and it’s lost forever. </Text>
            <Notes>“Mandri, I lost my hand because of him.”
“Was that really because of him”
“No, I know. That wasn’t his fault either.”

THAT story of Ayram hitting Purl and breaking is what gets Purl to drop the hate.

“What’d he say?”
“You’re too kind to be a Minder.”
“Oh. That.”

“Kalemun. And you?”
“Ayramun.”
“I take it you are Ayram?”
“I am.”
“Well, Ayram, I’m afraid I’m going to have to make you do something that you don’t want to do. I can’t let you through the pass. You’re going to have to return east.”
“You think I’m a servant of Schisol?”
“I do, but I don’t know for sure, and I’m not going to kill you on a suspicion.”
Obo’s voice from behind Mandri’s ear.
“If I could interrupt.”
All eyes turned Mandri.
Obo whispered, “Mandri, turn around.”
“What? Why.”
“Just turn around, dammit!”
Mandri spun around, giving Obo a clear view of Greskal and Ayram.
“There is, at present, a large enemy force headed this way.”
“We are running from Hrks,” explained Ayram.
“Are you?”
“Actually,” Obo said, “It’s not the Hrks that I was referring to. 











Do you have beds?”
“I sorry I can’t allow you to sup with us. You have women with you.”
“Is that a problem?”
“Women aren’t allowed on sanctuary grounds.”
“Why not?”
Greskal looked at Ayram dumbly and said, “Because it is a sanctuary.”
“I was not aware that women weren’t allowed in sanctuaries.”
“They are, but lustful thoughts are not. Our sanctuary does not allow for women so as to protect the thoughts of the men. Widows and orphans and orphans only.”
“Elrahet is a widow, and those two are orphans,” Ayram said, nodding towards Moteah and Purl.
Greskal eyed them warily. A man who felt like he was being taken advantage of.
“You may come, but the women will be kept separate and out of sight.”
Ayram said, “As long as they have beds.”
Greskal nodded, then began to climb the steps. “Come,” he said.

Brown.
Brass domes, gleaming in the sun.
A watch-fire outside the gate. 
“Greskal! You’ve brought friends!”
“I have.”
Mood of the men soured as soon as they saw Moteah, Purl, and Elrahet.
“We shall eat here instead of the hall.”
Set out food.
Mandri held the in his 
“Seems fishy to me,” said Mandri.
Obo said, “It’s bread, how can it taste fishy.”
“No, I mean these Kalemites.” He waited, but the usually talkative Obo was silent.
“What do you think?” He asked.
“I don’t care about the vagaries of power that trouble the Goree Pass.”
“Sure, but what does your instinct say?”
“I don’t have instincts.”
“Hazard a guess.”
“Mandri, I don’t make guesses. There is only what I know, and what I don’t.”
“Bullshit. I’ve heard you make guesses before.”
Obo is like, Ugh.
“If a man has so little control of himself that the mere presence of women drives him into euphorics, then that man is little more than a studded bull.”
Mandri frowned and said, “Oh, that’s not fair.”
Purl, chomping on her wiggostick, asked, “What’s not fair about it?”
Sign of submissiveness. “You guys don’t know what it’s like. Especially not you, Obo, you can just choose to stop feeling things whenever you want. It doesn’t work like that for a man. When the urges come, they come, it’s not a thing.”



“This will be your room.”
“Smells of stale piss,” Elrahet said.
“Piss always smells stale,” said Greskal.
Elrahet snarled, “What do you, spend your days sniffing piss? I want a different room.”
“I’m sorry, this is the only room we’ve got.”
“I seen twelve rooms past this one.”
“This is the only one with a working lock.”
“We won’t need it.”
“Actually, as women are not allowed on the temple grounds, I’m going to have to request that you stay confined to these quarters.”
“Of course, you don’t need to lock us in.”
Seeing the unhappy faces.
“It’s not that I don’t trust you, it’s just our way.”
“No one locked me up last time I was here.”
“When were you last here?”
Elrahet grunted. Mandri didn’t think it was fair.
“What about me? I’m not woman.”
“You are tonight. Sorry.”
Greskal stepped out of the room and the door slammed shut behind him. The clacking of the iron lock as its bar shunted into place.

Eunuch just means a man who’s bad at his job.
“Painted Eunuch, Eunuched Painter, or Pain

“Lets see your paintings then.”
“I don’t have any here.”
“A painter who doesn’t paint is bad at his job.”

Press the burgeons into the beer.

That’s how Mandrameen felt about it, so that’s how it was. Insert absurdity here. He ended up selling what little he owned and bought an ox and a farm twenty leagues outside of Meskalim. Then he spent a few years trying to turn a profit by farming legumes. All different kinds. Mostly, he’d smash up the beans to make a variety of curds. He’d then dry those out into little curd-bricks and crunchy curd-skins, but that never made enough money. 
Nowadays, the two of them - the former child prodigy and his ox - would laze away the days together under a solitary hornscrub tree in the middle of a barren field. The ox would sleep and Mandri would drink or smoke whatever he could get his hands on, because being sober got in the way of enjoying the moment. Plus, getting high made everything move. That’s one feature of reality that’s noticeably absent from any painting - true movement.
Mandri found that if he dried out some brown burgeons, crushed them up and mixed them into a milky-white barley beer that he’d left steeping in a hole in the ground, well two mouthfuls of that and he could start to see the salt actively ooze out of the ground and into his ruined field.
There was something in the burgeons that skewed his vision and made anything tinted white seem to sparkle and breathe. What it was, he didn’t know. Divinity? The of God? Mandri honestly didn’t care. He just enjoyed the sight of the salt stain squirming around his scattered stalks of wheat, gnawing at their stems, because that made it seem like he hadn’t just lost a battle to an inanimate thing. The salt was alive. His field no longer looked like a sweaty shirt that he’d left to dry in the sun, it looked like it was being overrun by an army of wriggling mites.
At least he’d managed to feed something.
So, that is what Mandri liked to do - drink his burgeon beer and sit in the shade of his tree, his ox companion at his side, and watch the salt stain emerge.
That was what he was doing when a strange woman came to visit. 
Mandri was sitting, thinking, and sighing to himself, sighing little half-sipped, absent sighs, the kind of sigh that he’d start to make whenever he was high and drunk and making too much sense. Then he saw that tall woman’s domineering figure marching up and down the hills in the distance. When it became clear that she was coming towards him, Mandri’s sighs turned into anxious groans.
His first instinct was to drink as much of his jumped-up beer as he could, because no doubt this unwelcome guest would want some, and he didn’t want to give her any. He took one big, stomach-swelling swig, and when that hit him too hard he felt sorry for himself and stopped. 
He then considered dumping the rest of the beer into the dusty earth out of spite, but that seemed almost sacrilegious. This was a special drink. He’d made plenty of special drinks, but this one was extra special because it was right there, a thing of the present. He could maybe try to hide it, tuck the clay jug away somewhere, maybe just nudge it behind the tree, but no doubt that harpy’s eyes were staring him down as she closed in. She’d see everything. 
Mandrameen decided, as drunkards and __ often do, to do nothing but enjoy the pleasantness while it lasted. He leaned back into his favorite tree crook and let his eyelids slouch as he watched the flies buzz around his ox’s snout. The ox would snore and blow those fuzzy black dots out of its nostrils, and then those flies would zip back in to lick at the only reliable source of moisture they could find in this fiery midday sun. 
The woman didn’t wave when she marched into Mandri’s field. She didn’t even say hello when she stepped into his shade. She looked to Mandri, then the ox, and then back to Mandri, and then wrinkled her nose at the smell of alcohol, musk, and feces, evidently unsure from which the worst was coming.
Then she asked a question. Her voice was tinged with an elder’s rasp.
“Are you Mandrameen?”
Mandri grunted in acknowledgment. He peered into the shadow of the woman’s blue-and-black shawl. He couldn’t find her eyes behind a nasty squint and a nose that was impossible to reason with. She wasn’t too old, just sun-leathered, and she stood with a steady, strong back despite the obvious weight of the bloated canvas bag strapped to it. That bag nearly doubled her size.
The strangest thing about her, aside from her very presence, was that she didn’t come adorned with the usual veneer of civilization; no shine-black bracelets, or bangles, or silver hoop earrings, no makeup or gold-threaded leaves trimming her robe. The only ornament she carried was a turtle-shell comb that she kept fashionably crooked in her waistband. The rest of her tawny self seemed slapped together in a reed hut on the banks of the Jarka river. She was a feral thing, light on her feet, unwashed and yet somehow clean.
And her teeth were somehow perfect; bright and sun-bleached. Mandri wondered if it was the burgeons making them look that way. They practically outshone the sun.
She looked him up and down and then asked a peculiar question.
“Do you still have your testicles?” 
Her teeth flashed as she spoke.
“Excuse me?” Mandri muttered.
The woman’s head pitched into a suspecting tilt. “You’re not a eunuch, are you? The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“And who are you?”
“Answer my question.”
“Of course I have my… who are you even supposed-”
“You do have your testicles, then?”
“I do.”
“Good.”
The woman sighed as she unshouldered her heavy pack. It hit the ground with a dull thump, and this disturbed the ox, who raised his heavy head. The ox saw the woman, gave a snort, then promptly went back to sleep. 
Without asking if Mandri minded, the woman sat down. She sat down right next to the ox’s head and gave him a comforting pat. Then she pulled from her ragged robe a brown paper booklet. This booklet had no cover, and its makeshift spine was composed of wax and twine.
She laid the booklet flat on the ground and flipped through a few pages. There weren’t many of them. Mandri tried to read what was on them, but the writing seemed to move and twist - no doubt the work of the burgeons. By this point he was high enough, that, no matter where he looked, the picture of his vision seemed like it was stretched across the surface of a slowly boiling stew.
“So, you are Mandrameen,” the woman said as she flattened an unruly page with her palm.
“And who are you?” Mandri asked for the second time.
“I am Pell. I am a priestess of Mid.” 
“I’ve never heard of Mid.”
“Not many have.”
“What are you doing here?”
“Forgive my intrusion. I won’t spend more time here than is necessary. I’m going to ask a few questions, and then be on my way.”
Mandri took another swig of his beer. He’d hoped Pell would have the courtesy to fill in some details, maybe explain her presence, but the woman just sat there, scanning her booklet for something in particular.
Mandri, being drunk, and high, or whatever you call that exalted state of being where the stomach is turning and the mind is swimming in , was incapable of dealing with an awkward silence so he decided get more direct.
“Is Mid a place?”
“Like I said, I’m just going to ask a few questions, then I’ll be on my way.”
“I can’t ask questions?”
“No.”
“Is every priestess of Mid so rude?”
“What did I just say?” 
Pell looked at Mandri like he was stupid. And he played the part. He even let a little drool drip over his lip. But he wasn’t so far gone yet. It’s not that he had built up a tolerance to burgeons, it’s that when he mixed this particular brew he found his wits were left wholly untouched. Well, mostly untouched. Maybe a little touched. Toddler touched. Honestly, Mandri wasn’t sure. One’s own capacity for reason is a difficult thing to determine even sober. 
Pell slapped her book shut. “You know what, okay. Alright.” She then crossed her legs, bent her ear in expectant pose, and said to Mandri, “Ask your questions.”
It stung Mandri that she’d caved so easily. 
“Where is Mid?” he asked.
“Mid is not a place, it is a god.”
“God of what?”
“He’s not a god of anything,” Pell said with a sneer. “He is simply a god.”
“Then what does he do?”
“At the moment, nothing.”
“Is he lazy, or what?”
“He doesn’t do anything because he is dead.”
“Oh. Well. That makes things make sense.”
“Are you done then? Satisfied with who I am?”
Mandri shrugged. Pell harrumphed and returned to her notes.
“It’s just, I’ve never seen a priestess without a pound of gold or silver rattling around her neck.”
“Is that so?”
“Worshiping a dead god would explain that general lack of propriety.”
 “A lack of propriety?” Pell repeated. Her casual squint morphed into one of downright annoyance.
“It means that -”
“I know what it means, you little shit.” 
Mandri laughed. 
“I mean no offense,” he said coyly. “I mean, a dead god can’t exactly answer prayers.”
“You are a little shit.”
If this woman were young and less stern, Mandri would have thought she was flirting. But she really meant it. He could feel her beady eyes boring holes of hate into his bones, even if he couldn’t quite see them.
Mandri took another long sip of his milky brew, then smacked his lips in satisfaction. He topped it off by saying, in his most patronizing tone, “Maybe if you found some manners I might extend my hospitality.”
“What hospitality could you possibly offer?”
“Are you blind, woman? I have drink.”
Pell looked on in disgust as Mandri took yet another long sip.
She said, “If you are the one that I’m looking for, then I swear I’ll stab the sun.”
“Is that why you’re here? You’re looking for someone?”
“It is.”
“Looking for someone who’s still got his balls?”
Pell sighed, and said “Yes”.
“That doesn’t exactly narrow it down,” Mandri said. But Pell was busy with her booklet. Something on the open page had caught her eye.
“Finally,” she muttered. “Mandrameen Andramawmun. That is your full name?”
Mandri nodded. Evidently Pell was underlining his name with her finger. What he was doing in her little book, he did not know. He didn’t have any outstanding debts, and he wouldn’t be able to pay up if he did.
“You have a good name,” Pell said. “A strong Jandri name. An Old-Jandri name. That’s good. And my notes say you started learning how to paint at the age of five.”
Mandri’s eyes narrowed. If this woman was looking for an artist for some backwater temple icon, she’d come to the wrong place.
She kept on reading from her book.
“My scribblings say you are a decent painter.”
She looked up to gauge Mandri’s reaction. Mandri figured it was to see if the word ‘decent’ had offended him. He thought it best to say nothing, to do nothing, though under the influence he couldn’t be sure if his face doing things all its own. That’s another thing about drugs - some give you certainty, some take it away, but if you’re a certain kind of person, it’s always the latter.
“They say you’ve got a…” Pell bent down to get a better look at the words. “It says you’ve got a triptych hanging in the garden of Zee. Is that the one with the clouds and the demons?”
Mandri nodded. “Is that all it says?”, he asked.
“No.”
“Well, I’m not a painter anymore. I’m a farmer.”
“Not a very accomplished farmer.”
“But that’s what I am.”
“You don’t want to paint?”
“It’s not a matter of want. I’m not a painter.”
“Not anymore, you mean.”
“Sure. Not anymore.”
“That’s good. You see, the reason why I’ve come, is that I’m looking for someone who fits an old prophecy, and that someone is a painter who doesn’t want to be a painter.”
Pell, again, was looking at him now. Mandri silent. Struck dumb by wtf is going on.
“We mustn’t get too excited,” Pell said flatly. “I’ve more questions to ask.”
She flipped to another page. Then she flipped right back to where she’d been. 
“Sorry. I’ve not done this in a while, so I might be skipping things I shouldn’t. Let me just make sure… Alright.” She fingered a scribble, then read it aloud. “Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“You can’t be serious.”
“Answer the question, please. Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“Of course I have, who hasn’t?”
“But have you spoken the words yourself? I’m not talking about being a part of a prayer circle as a child, where someone else does the heavy lifting. Have you ever run away to a quiet place and whispered words to Solraheen?”
“Who hasn’t?”
“You think so?”
“I’m a little confused by what’s going on here.”
“That is because you are drunk.”
“That’s actually a point in my favor.”
“And there’s burgeons in that beer.”
“Absurd.”
“I can smell them. And you got them buggy eyes. I bet you see . Tell me, what does my face look like right now?”
Mandri studied her face. At first, there was just her dark sillhoutte against the bright, sandy landscape behind, but the longer he looked the more the burgones. 
“It looks a face.”
“Hah! That’s good. Good, good, good. You’re fitting the mold, Mandrameen. Does that excite you?”
“Should it?”
“If the prospect of fulfilling a prophecy laid down at the dawn of time doesn’t excite you, then you’ve got a black Spark. Tell me, Mandrameen, how do you feel about power over all, eternal life, and infinite pleasure?”
“No, no, and yes, please.”
“Have you ever killed someone before?”
“No.”
“How do you feel about killing people?”
“What has that got to do with anything?”
Pell didn’t answer. She didn’t move, either. She kept looking across at Mandri as if he hadn’t said anything at all. A moment of this was more than Mandri could bear. He felt compelled to actually answer the question.
“I…I guess... I mean it depends on the context, doesn’t it? The morality of something like that, it depends. Like, am I killing in self-defense? Are these rapists? Private revenue agents?”
“You think that this is a question of morality?”
“Isn’t it?”
“Let me rephrase: How do you feel about people?”
“How do I feel about people?”
“That is what I asked.”
Vibrating glare. Force the truth up out of him.
“Could do without them.”
“You wouldn’t mind if everyone dropped dead?”
“Did I say that?”
“You Implied it.”
“Yeah but - look, I’m a person, too. I’m people.”
“Observant.”
“I might not like ‘people’, but it’s not anything... We’re just stupid. Doesn’t mean we all deserve to die. What is this prophecy anyways? I do something, and then a lot of people die?” 
“That’s generally how prophecies work. Something happens, and a lot of people die.”
“But this prophecy, specifically, what happens?”
“In this prophecy, the great lord Inumenal will be freed to roam the earth and heal this fractured world.”
“That doesn’t sound evil at all.”
“It isn’t.”
“Then what does that have to do with people dying?”
“Mandri, people are dying all the time. Right this very moment. And I don’t mean one or two, a lot of people are dying right now. All Inumenal is going to do is make sure that they’re dying for a purpose.”
“And you need me to free him?”
“Someone like you will do it, yes.”
“Not me?”
“It might be you.”
Pause.
“Well, find someone else.”
“That’s not how prophecies work. I don’t pick someone to play the role. You are who you are, and if you are the one who is prophesied, then that is that.”
Mandri grunts.
“A few more questions.”
“No. We’re done.”
“Have you ever had a lover?”
Mandri at the absurdity. 
Pell said, “The one I’m looking for is a virgin.”
“I’m not a virgin.”
The resultant smirk that dawned on Pell’s thin lips made Mandri feel exposed. She was looking at him from the shadow of her brow and .
“Believe whatever you want. I’m not a virgin.”
“Then why do the girls in town name you a eunuch?”
“Look, just because I don’t go in for the haggard women of Meskalim, that doesn’t make me a virgin. And what are you on about anyways?”
“I’ve already said. several times. I’m looking for -”
“No, I know what you’re doing, but what is the point? If what is going to happen is going to happen regardless of whether or not you, or I, want it to happen, then what are you even doing out here, looking around for ‘the prophesied’?”
Pell gets contemplative.
“If you’ve ever had a lover, then you know what its like to wait for one.”
“I don’t get it.”
Pell lean back.
“Not to put too fine a point on it, but Inu is my lover. I’ve gotten impatient with waiting. I can think of nothing else but his arrival, so, I look out the window. That’s what I’m doing, in a manner of speaking, I’m here, looking out the window for a sign of his coming.”
Mandri scoffed at the thought of this witchy woman being the consort of anyone, much less a god. He shrugged to show his lack of concern and said, “Well, if I see him, I will let you know.”
“You just might. You do fit all the criteria.”
“How? I’m not a virgin.”
“I’ll leave that bit there to interpretation.”
Pell then closed her book and snuck it back into her robes. “There’s really only one way to know for sure if you are the one who is foretold.”
“And what is that?”
“To know for sure, you have to go into Meskalim and talk to Salavan Soreen.”
With that, Pell stood up and slapped the dirt off her knees. Mandri, thinking she was about to leave, leaned back into his crook, sighed, and whispered a chime of praise.
“Oh, I’m not leaving yet,” Pell said. “There’s one last thing. I haven’t eaten in ages.”
“Well, I don’t have any food.”
“You have an ox.”
Mandri looked over to his ox, who was awake now. It’s fat, bulging eyes were staring blankly off into the horizon. Mandri gave him a pat on the shoulder and said, “I’m not going to kill him just so you can nibble at his flank.”
“Its not his flank that I want.”
“You can’t have any piece of him. Gil isn’t for eating.”
“You named the ox, Gil?”
“I did.”
Gil mooed in recognition.
“What’s Gil for, then, if not for eating? Don’t tell me he’s for farming, I won’t believe it.”
“Gil keeps me company.”
“You bought an ox for company?”
“I did. And he’s not for sale either.”
Mandri heard the draw of a blade and was shocked to see Pell holding a long, golden knife, glinting in the dappled light of the tree’s shadow. She knelt down and started to scrape it’s razor edge up and down against Gil’s neck. The poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, closed his eyes and lifted his chin to make sure Pell could scratch the whole length of his throat.
“Now that’s unnecessary,” Mandri said. “Let Gil be.”
“Why?”
“Because I said so.”
“He is going to die eventually anyways. Going to die soon by the look of him.”
“If you put one scratch on him, then I’m gong to balance and twist your jaw.”
“You’d do that? You’d kill me to save your ox?”
“Without hesitation.”
Pell lowered her blade. 
“If you are the one,” she said, “then there’s an important lesson you need to learn: nothing can change the course of the divine plan.”
“What does that even mean?”
“It means that I can do whatever I want, and you’d be powerless to stop me.”
Pell smiled, glared at Mandrameen, and she looked right down into his soul as she cupped Gil’s snout under her arm and reached around his neck with her knife. Then she plunged her blade into the ox’s flesh. She’d done it tight up against his jaw and brusquely yanked the blade round to the other side, but before she’d gotten halfway, Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and his whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head from Pell’s grasp. He leapt to his feet, knocked Pell on her ass, and then bolted off into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went. 
Pell laughed. 
Mandri, frozen by the sudden shock of violence, watched in horror as Gill came to a stop just ten yards away. It was as if the beast had looked out into the empty distance and realized he had nowhere to go.
Gil stood there for a moment, head bowed, blood pouring into the earth, and then he looked back in confusion towards Mandri and Pell, looked back just in time to see his old master pick up a rock, snarl, and leap after the woman.
But one sharp elbow in the balls sent Mandrameen sprawling to the ground.
“So, you’re not a liar”, Pell said with an ____ ____.
Mandri muttered a curse. He got to his knees and reached out to grab Pell’s ankle, but the woman leapt to her feet with the speed and grace of a lizard jumping from a .
And then… 
And then Mandri saw something he couldn’t believe.
Pell jumped over him and literally flew towards the wounded ox.
She flew straight like an arrow flung from a bow, and as she passed over Mandri it seemed like she was nothing but a snarling head and billowing robe. For the briefest moment he saw her face unshawled: her green eyes were wild with excitement, and her bright-white teeth were fanged, and they flashed behind an unearthly snarl that burned into closed-eye mind.
Pell plunged head first into the Gil’s body, tearing a hole into his belly as easily as if her nose were made of obsidian. Gil crumpled to the ground, and Pell went with him, head and shoulders fixed into his side.
Before Gil had the chance to spasm, Pell tore herself from his flesh. The neck of his first stomach was clenched in between her teeth. She spat it out, then ripped the rest of the innards from it’s lining, and held it all up to the sun. Mandri clasped his ears the moment her lips began to utter a speech which must have come from the darkest depths of Shis.
Mandri prepared himself to witness the final of gore and , her now radiant fangs ripping into the , but that wasn’t what happened. 
Instead, Pell squeezed a bright point of light from the stomach, bright as the sun, and she sipped it into her chest like one might sip a tea.
Beyond that point, Mandri was not able to construct a coherent sequence of events. The only thing he remembered happening for certain was that Pell stood above him, bloodripe and forsen, and commanded him to, “Go and see Salavan Soreen.”

            <Title>Old dead body</Title>
            <Text>Two travelers set out into the Sand alone.
One is a man who expects too much. The other is a woman who expects too little. 
They happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Empty Portion. They are hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundred of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in space and time, in the most inhospitable place, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance. You see, he actually expects to find a bit of strangeness out in great sand sea—after all, the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he’s stumbled upon and all he can see is a strange coincidence.
A simple coincidence.
Thats all it is to him. That’s all it is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, she is stunned by the significance of moment. She did not expect to see someone in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two souls to meet in such a wasteland without planning it, well it could not be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for a purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. That’s all there is to it—it is nine lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say that the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in a secret vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for providence to be revealed, but who can say for certain?
Orthodox freaks preach that there must be another tablet. It’s not worth asking why - it’s a conclusion wrought from a peculiar twist of logic and eschatology that’s not worth getting into. What’s important is that they claim the next tablet will prove that the story is a story about Solraheen himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. They’re people, floundering around for a glimpse of the divine like everyone else. Maybe that man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Soreel believed. Actually, he went a little further. He believed that the pair never existed at all.
He’d tell anyone who’d listen to his liquored up sermons that this story, the raw events themselves, they weren’t important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson there in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a few, simple questions:
 What would have happened if the woman went into the Empty Portion and made it safely through without encountering a soul? 
Absolutely nothing. 
That’s what would have happened. And Would she have glimpsed the divine plan then? 
Absolutely not.
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, and wouldn’t have given a single thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety.
She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries.
She never would have shed a tear at the wonder.
She never would turned here eyes to the heavens and spoken His name.
But He would have been there all the same.
And that’s the lesson. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. To be struck dumb by the sight of the His plan in one case and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. Both travelers were blinded by expectations, and blind is the word because it takes righteous eyes to see the will of Solraheen.
And it’s always expectations that is the problem. This was Seb’s contribution that growing puddle called Solrah theology. Expectations weren’t necessarily the source of damnation, but they sure were a sign of it. Seb wrapped it up into a pithy statement of faith:
Expectations turn the vividness of the present into an ignorable blur. 
Sometimes Seb liked to put it a little more bluntly: “Expectations ruin everything”. And that’s how it was. Of course, none of this stopped him from having expectations himself. No one is perfect. No one except Solraheen.
Seb once stumbled upon a bald, aching, stiff-jointed pilgrim who claimed that if you don’t have righteous eyes then the next best thing to have is nothing at all. The pilgrim claimed to be able sit perfectly still and chant his mind into such a trance that his body required no food or water, nor even air, and more importantly, he said his thoughts were free from expectations.
Seb tried to induce this meditative state in himself, but he couldn’t do it. He doubted the old pilgrim could either, at least not for any meaningful length of time. Sitting still and simply existing is what a rock does, and people aren’t rocks. People look at things, and when they look they try to understand and when they try to understand the expectations inevitably come. 
Seb figured that if he had to have some expectations then best thing to do was to expect as little as possible. Err on the side of the woman traveler. At least she had some appreciation for Solraheen’s mysteries. To add to that, having no expectations and expecting to not have anything were close enough to the same thing. They used a lot of the same words. Like if you took those words and put them in a bag and shook that bag around then there’s no telling which idea you’ll get out of it. Seb figured maybe life works that way. Maybe if he had an idea-enough-like-the-right-idea, then when life shook him up like it always did, he might pop on over to the correct frame of mind. Like how a shrimp is a lot like a fish, and if he put one on a hook and tossed it the water, then give it a quick yank at the right moment, then surprise, out pops a fish. If he could successfully transmute life doing that, why shouldn’t it work with an idea? It worked with . Put a fact on a hook and you’ll pull up a truth. Sounded pithy, sounded true, must be true. Maybe if he fished with the a crumb of an expectation he’d pull up the untethered void of the self reflected in the eye of Solraheen.
Until then, he’d have to wait. 
And he had to keep his expectations low. 
It was a natural enough thing to do. Thirty years of living in a land that some languages call Emptiness has that effect.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. He knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the hills from rain, how the Utzal wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Burgos mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces looking down at you. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders, their chins tufted with thornscrub. It seemed like even the weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. They used make it up over the Hias and they watered the Junei plain, making it a paradise. The evidence was there in the foothills. If you got up into the ridges of the Hias and looked north towards the Junei Plain you could see the lighter clay of long-dried washes snaking through the foothills for as far as there are foothills.
Of course, when you’re down in those foothills you don’t notice them. Down there you only see sun baked clay and that clay is so hard that you can’t imagine it had ever seen rain. To illustrate: one night, Seb spit on the ground and when he woke, five whole hands later, the glob of his spit was still there. The water of his body hadn’t seeped into the dirt. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi leaves he chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. And so nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and a lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to drink the urine. 
Birds don’t count either because they’re just passing through. 
You could find beetles if you ripped the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes you’d have to bore into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is that their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and you can’t boil or steam the smell out, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that can keep you alive and the things that can kill you.
Everything else is nothing. 
That being said, there’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them… they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
And that’s what Seb saw as he stood atop one of the Hias foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain. He saw nothing. There wasn’t even a horizon for it was lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only its not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed his world, because it looks like something, but really it’s nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.
“Oi, Seb! There's somethin ‘ere!”
Seb’s ears pricked at the words. The shout had come from a nearby ravine.
Quick and spry as lizard zipped up on freeweed, Seb scrambled over to the lip of that noisome ravine and leered down into its deep belly. 
One of his fellow Ayramun was standing there at the bottom of it. Seb knew it was Gugi and not anyone else by the way he stood. Everyone was swaddled from head to toe in brown wool dusted red by clay, but only Seb and Gugi stood with that twitchy restlessness that marks out a Jandri man who’s not stopped chewing the spines of borcandi leaves since the day they were weened from the tit. And Gugi was also a little taller than most. A little lankier. 
Gugi stuck his skinny arm up in the air and waved it towards Seb.
Seb sneered at the way the joints creaked like a corpse. — you get it.
“Put your goddamned hand down,” Seb shouted. “I can see you just fine.”
“Then get your ass down here!” Gugi shouted back.
Seb harrumphed to himself and then started his climb down into the ravine.
As far as ravines go it seemed as full of nothing as any other. It was a little steeper than most, and it was dry and dusty so Seb’s feet couldn’t find purchase on the slope. He was forced into a clumsy half-scramble-half-slide to get down the bottom, which was about twenty yards down. Once there he took a moment to kick the dirt off the heel of his boot.
The remarkable thing about this ravine was how even and straight it was. Almost like a road. It went straight as an arrow for a full fifty yards before getting lost around a bend. Smack-dab in the middle of those fifty yards was the dried out husk of a karkle bush. Gugi was standing in front of that bush, looking a little spooked.
Seb took his time ambling on over. He fingered a fresh borcandi spine out of his sleeve pocket as he went. He knew there wouldn’t be nothing worth noticing because Gugi had a habit of pointing out any old thing that caught his interest. Maybe there’d be a pricked-up drag-belly hissing inside that bush, but fat little lizards doing four-legged push-ups and flashing their ruddy throats weren’t worth shouting about. 
They weren’t something.
They were to be expected.
Part of the ignorable blur.
Seb almost laughed at the way Gugi urged him on with an impatient flick of the wrist. 
“I ain’t gonna run in this heat,” Seb said.
Gugi shook his head and mumbled something Seb couldn’t hear. 
“Pipe down, sun’s sake, I’m comin’.”
Seb eyed the karkle bush. There was definitely something hidden underneath its twiggy branches. A lumpy shape of something shadowed. It was dark and unmoving and apparently unconcerned with how Gugi was brushing the karkle’s branches aside to get a better look. 




  karkle bush, he expected to see the bush’s woody stem firmly planted into red clay. There might be pebbles, and maybe a rock or two that he’d have to move, but that was it. He didn’t expect to see a creature hiding under those wide boughs. If you’d asked him before hand what kind of creature he’d expect to see out there,he’d say a black-spined drag-belly because drag-bellies lived on this side of the Junei plain. Odd for them to be out at this time of day, just-past-morning, when the sun is getting hot and even the shade of the bush doesn’t do enough to stop the heat. Odd but not quite strange. It would be a strange, very strange, to find the dead body of a boy. Now that he did not expect.

“You know, this is the first bush I looked under.”
“What?”
“Yeah. It’s the first bush I looked under. I was like, this bush is in the perfect position, halfway up the ravine, bet it will be the best spot to -”
“You’re saying it’s the first bush you looked under?”
“Yeah.”
“
It was the first bush he’d looked under, too. There were at least twenty other bushes in that dusty ravine, and the first one he looked under sheltered a dead boy. 
A strange coincidence.
A divine sign.
Seb’s skin prickled.


Gugi was stumbling his way down to the road because he thought he’d heard Seb say that he’d found a body. When he hopped on over to where Seb was standing, he pulled his scarf down under his proud chin to ask for clarification. He rarely stopped chewing. His words were a little lost in between the squelches.
“Didn’t quite get that.”
Seb pulled his own scarf down in kind. His face was a little thinner than Gugi’s, and his nose was longer and crooked, and his cheeks were ravaged with pits from . He chewed his borcandi spine a bit more gingerly because most of his teeth thin were thick with rot. Anyone who meets the twins, especially if they meet them at the same time, the first thought is always to wonder why the gods had reserved all the handsomeness for Gugi. The second thought is to wonder if poor Seb had been cursed, or if it was just bad luck - poor Seb thought he was cursed with bad luck.
And this was why seb was so stuck in coincidences. For he and his brother had coincided in the womb.
“Look there,” Seb said to Gugi.
“Where?”
“Feet here,” Seb said. “And you can see an arm, and there, a grayish cloak of somewhat.”
Gugi squatted down next to the bush and tried to peer under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“A body, eh? Guess he’s dead?”
“He’s not napping.”
“Well… pull him out then.”
“Pull him out?”
“The mans dead. He won’t mind.”
Seb’s jaw dropped. All his little crooked teeth. Blinked like he couldn’t believe, had to reboot the brain. “There’s a dead body under this bush, and that doesn’t concern you in the least bit? You just want to, what, pull him out and rifle through his clothes?”
“No. I want to pull him out wo we can put him somewhere else.&quot;
“Just put him somewhere else?”
“Isn’t that why you called me down here?”
“I called you down here because there’s a goddamned dead body under my bush… out here, under this bush... That doesn’t get your grind going? The boy’s still bleeding!”
Gugi took a little rock and pushed on mandri’s foot, squeezed a drop of blood through the blood caked blisters. his dark brows raised a little as he realized that this wasn’t just a dead body, it was a freshly dead body. Still, he wasn’t about to encourage Seb’s hysteria, so the most assent he was willing to do was to shrug and say, “Alright. This is unusual.”
“Unusual?!” Seb spun around to face Gugi and was about to burst. “It’s a goddamned curse! Clear as day!”
“Come on Seb, don’t start.”
“Start what? There’s a goddamned dead body in my hiding spot!”
“Calm down! Holy hell. It’s just a dead body. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Seb was about to burst, but then a shrewd thought popped his 
“Did you put this here?” He asked.
“What?” Gugi’s face was streteched beyond belief.
“Did you put this dead body here?”
“What?”
A moment.
“You think I’d kidnap some random bloke back in Solstan, haul his ass all the way out here, then kill him and stuff him up under your bush, just get you all stirred up?”
A smile started to spread on Gugi’s face when he realized that was exactly what Seb was thinking.
That smile was, to Seb, as good an admittance of guilt as any.
A dawnign as the rage started to take Sabe. Gugi came clean before he could blow. 
“Relax! Holy hell. Goddamn. Relax. I didn’t do it.”
“Then who did?” Seb asserted. “This body is fresh as a daisy’s bum. If there was someone skulking around these hills, planting bodies under bushes to put us off, we would have seen him. Had to be one of the Ayramun. And if it was any of them, it’d be you.”
“Ay-ya. Seb. No one is trying to curse you. This poor bik under your bush has nothing to do with us. He’s probably some wayward pilgrim who crawled up under there to eat the dirt and forgot to wake up. It doesn't mean anything. It’s just a dead body. It doesn’t even smell. Just get up in there, and lets get on with it.”'
&quot;I’m not cuddlin' up with no dead body,&quot; Seb said. &quot;And in point of fact, this ain’t no pilgrim road. This ain’t no pilgrim. It’s a dead body out in the middle of nowheres - not the middle of nowheres, its right in the middle of my bush, and that’s the clearest shout of a curse I’ve ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this.&quot;
“He doesn’t need to hear about this.&quot;
&quot;Have you lost your water? Ayram ought to know there's a dead body down here!&quot;
&quot;Don't worry Ayram with this shit. Just get in that bush and stop moaning.&quot;
&quot;How abouts you get in that bush?&quot;
&quot;Okay. I will. I’ll do it if it will stop your shitting.&quot;
&quot;No! You’re not getting in that bush.&quot;
“But you just said -”
“I’m not gonna let you cuddle up under no cursed demon bush right before shit gets hot.”
“Someone’s getting in this bush. There’s no time to be scrying and softing about what is and isn’t cursed.”
Seb grabbed his brother’s shoulder before he could pull himself up under the karkle bush.
&quot;Look around,&quot; Gugi said. &quot;There aren't any other spots.&quot; He gestured to the sloped walls of the ravine. If a rock was big enough, or a divot in the earth deep enough, a fellow bandit was already settling in. Most were lying down up top, above the ravine's lip. 
Gugi crawls up under. Bunch of rustling as he tries to get comfortable. He can’t. “He’s kinda funny looking”. Has second thoughts.
“Holy shit!”
“What! What is it?!”
“I know who this is.”
“Who?”
“Holy shit.”
“Who is it?!”
Gugi scrambled out from under the bush much faster, much less carefully than how he got in.”
Seb looked at him expectantly, eyes wide and . Gugi was finally looking properlly of haveing seen a dead body.
“Thats fucking Salavan Saran’s kid!”
“Who?”
“Salavan Saran’s kid! What’s his name? Man- something. That’s Salavan’s kid under that bush.”
“Oh shit?”
“Yeah thats him.”
“You sure?”
“Pull him out and see for yourself.”
“I’ve never seen him before. Wouldn’t be able to recognise him.”
“Pull him out anyways. Because you’re right, Ayram needs to know about this.”
“I ain't touchin' no dead body.”
“Dammit. Seb. Grab his foot.”
“You grab his foot!”
“I’m going to!” Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of Mandri’s left ankle. He stared at Seb and shook Mandri’s ankle to show Seb just how tightly he was holding on. Mandri’s foot flopped around like limp fish. Seb took a step backwards.
“Now grab the other foot,&quot; Gugi said.
Seb crossed his arm and shook his head. “Do it yourself.”
“Seb.”
“Gugi.”
“Seb , if you don’t squat down and do a part, I’m gonna start breakin rules.”
Seb scoffed and kicked the dirt. “I ain’t touchin’ no dead body.”
Gugi rubbed his temples. He hated that he had to be the bigger boy. Seb had this way ever since they were kids, this stubbornness, it worked to get him what he wanted, which was always something new and shiny and . Gugi hated resorting to this, to losing Seb’s stupid games, but there wasn’t time to stamp his foot and wrestle it out.
“Okay Seb, what do you want.”
“To get the hell away from that dead body.”
“Help me carry it to Ayram and I’ll give you my shard of salcite.”
Troble speaking with the borkine spine but they do it anyway.
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. His jaw went slack and the borkine spine nearly slipped out of his mouth.
“The pointy shard?” He asked.
Gugi nodded. “The pointy one.”
A moment,
“How about it?”
“I can’t take your salcite,” Seb said. “That kind of stone can’t be parted with.”
“Hell.”
“It’s the lucky stone. If you got rid of it, passed it on without the best of reasons, you’d be cursin’ yourself as bad as as this dead body is cursin’ me. That stone is alive. Elemental. It found you, you didn’t find it.”
“It’s a goddamned stone.”
“There’s no such thing as a ‘goddamned’ stone. If you ever listened to Ayram, you’d know that.”
Gugi pulled the stone in question out of his pocket. Describe it. 
He held it up between his finger and his thumb, so that Seb could get a good look at it.
“Help me carry the body,” Gugi said, “or I’ll crush this thing into a million pieces, and then I’ll scatter the crumblings around you as you sleep.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“I’ll mumble the witch’s anguish as I do it.”
“You don’t know the words to the witch’s anguish.”
“I didn’t say I’d chant it, I said I’d mumble it, and as long as I get the cadence right, thats good enough to get the demons stirring.”
“You’re not gonna do that.”
“I will if you don’t help me.”
Seb’s brow returned to its near-permanent scowl. His mind raced for some way to get out of this situation. Gugi was a stubborn ass, and even though Seb knew that Gugi didn’t put stock in curses and luck and mystery, he knew that Gugi would do it if it meant annoying him. 
But if Gugi couldn’t be moved, maybe someone else could. 
He turned round to face the other side of ravine, and called over to the young Papillion, who was busy nestling into the dirt behind a boulder.
“Hey Papi! Come help us move something!”
Papi had been listening the whole while to Seb and Gugi’s little argument. He knew full well there was a body there in the bush. This close to the ambush, people weren’t supposed to be talking, much less shouting, so he showed Seb the back of his finger, and went back to burying himself.
Gugi saw this and said to Seb, “Even Papi won’t put up with your shit. Always trying to get out of things. If I weren’t in charge of this little squad, then I’d leave and make you do it yourself.”
“I’m not trying to get out of anything. It’s just good sense to make someone else do it. The body isn’t cursing Papi, it’s cursing me!”
“That’s trying to get out of it. Now, we both carry him.”
“It's a limp body. It's easier if just one person carries him.”
“And how you figure that?”
“It’s a limp body.”
“Seb, if you don’t grab that leg… 
Change tact.
“I don’t want you to get in trouble. See, I’m gonna hike all the way back to Ayram, alone, and he’s gonna ask me what I’m doin there tellin him about a dead body instead of showin it to him. And I don’t want to blame you for not helping, but that’s the truth. And then he’s gonna make an example out of you.”
“Ayram will understand.”
“If thats what you think, then fine.”
Nothing to do but march off to Ayram. The quick, easy step of a man unburdond by guilt. Soft, head up.
“Wait! Wait.”
Gugi stopped.
“I’ll help.”
Huffing , making a scene out of touching it. Grumbling and complaining all the way back to the plateau.
 Rope, gugi climbs up first, little moment where Seb is staring at the body, then body gets hauled up, and seb climbs up after.

Shelf of rock, titlted, like the corner of a broken table of the gods half-sunk into the sand.


Ayram grabbed Mandri’s right arm and threw him up and over his shoulder, like he was taking off with poached game. He then clambered up the scree, both hands free, easily balancing Mandri’s light weight. In fact, Mandri felt so light that he thought this giant of a man could have thrown him up to the cliff’s edge with one arm. That would have been as comfortable.
When they came to the cliff face Ayram let out a shrill whistle, and a rope came tumbling down from above. Ayram twirled this scratchy rope around Mandri’s waist, deftly knotted it with his long, deft fingers, then tugged it tight, and then Mandri was off.
Mandri bounced along as the rope pulled him up the cliff face. Along the way caught sight of people down in the ravine. The sight of their little heads popping out from behind rocks and boulders, or the lip of the ravine on either side of the road, was shocking. They’d been there the whole time, and he’d walked right through the middle of them.



 He could see ill omens in the darting flight of a black bird. Blabh blah blah. Or, as now, in the body of a boy under a bush.
This was a strange coincidence because he was about to hide up under this bush. That there was a dead body already there - freshly dead by the look of him - well that was a strange coincidence indeed.
 Solraheen has seen special care to him
Blue eyes staring into a bush at a body, where a body should not be.
 

If he had lived another hour longer he would smelled the musky odor of sweat and beak oil wafting down from the top of the ravine. He would have heard the soft patter of footsteps on the dusty road. He would have seen the bark-sheathe boots a man stop right in front of his bush, and he would have felt two blue-grey eyes gawking down at him through the spaces in-between the karkle's twigs. 
Two blue-grey eyes, Jandri eyes, belonging to a man named Seb Soreel. They were sparkling, bright and curious, and they narrowed as they searched Mandri’s bundled body for any sign of life. Seb thought it would be strange to find someone here on the side of the road, but he knew it would be a bad, bad omen if that someone was dead.

            <Title>Mandrameen</Title>
            <Text>A Solitant priest hears the word ‘white’ and he thinks of the pure white glow of Solraheen—a white so bright that it bursts out of itself and splits subtly into rays of red and blue. A Hrkan man hears the word ‘white’ and he pictures the plain and stainless robes of Hrkan Lordship. An outland man hears ‘white’ and he thinks of sparkling salt pans, or clouds, or sun-bleached bone. The word has as many different imaginings as there are people who hear it. Such as it is with all words, because words are wispy things that don’t sit still even when pinned down to a page. It is some wonder, then, why Solraheen chose to create the universe with a word. Some think He should have chosen a different medium, because one result of creation being a word is that people have been debating the meaning of it forever, and will continue to do so forever. 
Solraheen spoke one word and the whole universe popped into being. For obvious reasons, this was not a well-documented event, and so the word He used is not known. Solraheen once retold the story through a vision in the sky, but no one wrote down a description of this because doing so would reduce His image to words on a page, and words are wispy things. Too much would be lost in the translation, and then more would be lost to theological debate.
Some who were present painted the scene. Some sculpted it. These were the first artists, and artists were the first prophets, the first men and women into which Solraheen breathed a vision, for they were the only ones who possessed the skill to communicate it. But in the ages since then, ‘artist’ has become a word, and like all words, its meaning became a subject of heated debate.
Who isn’t an artist?
A dancer, a sculptor, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a hole-digger? Can’t he can be an artist too if he digs holes in a way that’s true to himself? Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and he’ll dig a pure expression of his innermost world. Most men will dig a penis to be funny, but that only sharpens the point, for if a man digging a big old ugly into a field is an artist then the word is as useless as an unmarked weight. A sheep-shearer is an artist. Even a tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed.
A true artist, though, that is a distinction with walls, and it has almost nothing to do with what a person does—whether it be dancing, digging, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never do anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artistry is a state of mind. To be sure, it’s not a noble one. It’s about comic excess; too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense of self that it becomes impossible to describe the true artist without resorting to sarcasm.
For example: Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.
When asked what he did for a living, he’d say, “Nothing important. I paint things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. Then he’d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and this charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then he’d flash a knowing smile. 
He’d say these things directly to an artist’s face if he could get to it. He didn’t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. Maybe they were the only safe targets, because it’s not really the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are completely different things. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity.
He would say to Vigram, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” Vigram’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Vigram’s wealth be damned, Mandri’s knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if, by some cosmic absurdity, he wasn’t correct in the literal, figurative, or spiritual sense, then ‘correctness’ was not a possibility for anyone, least of all, Vigram. Old Vigram was not an artist, not even the penis-in-the-field kind. He’d made his fortune as a creditor. Meanwhile Mandrameen, when he was ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
And these were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait, he observed a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of color he could define the skin, the cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, and even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman’s portrait using just twenty-four strokes—count them, twenty-four—and it was a true, vivid likeness. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. Nobody noticed them. It didn’t stop Vigram from marveling at how young Mandri packed so much information into so few slips of paint. 
In Vigram’s eyes they were the marks of genius, and he told Mandri as much. And often.
He paid Mandri for lessons. This was something of a charity, for Mandri was twenty years and inexplicably poor.
These lessons were given in Vigram’s countryside villa, a good ways away from the must and crust of Meskalim. The day started with breakfast, where Vigram, a burly old man with a bald head and brown belly-beard that he kept oiled, curled, and trimmed, would push Mandri to explain why his great talent hadn’t achieved success. Each week he’d put the question in a different way, but it was always about that same basic thing: why wasn’t Mandri swimming in money?
Mandri would explain that financial success, when it comes to art, has little to do with skill or quality. Novelty plays a role, but mostly it’s about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It’s about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. Vigram always pushed back, and today Mandri settled the matter by declaring, in between mouthfuls of pickled lizard lung, “I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.”
Vigram would then regale Mandri with the story of his own life, and he’d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too. Vigram had told the story so many times that Mandri could tell it right back.
First, inherit four ounces of silver.
Easy.
Then, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure its a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing the mob will burn down in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, because you are, but if you get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and a glint of silver, well, the bleary shine will blind him.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s budding bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it’s got a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, its a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’ve devolved into a human spider you’ll be able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the holy continent. People will walk right into the debt. The wiggling only sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed, and as long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it’s all self-sustaining.
And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you want.
“No debasement necessary,” Mandri concluded before crunching into a piping hot slice of fish spleen.
“That’s right,” said Vigram. “You see, you know about all about art, but I know all about money. And that’s why I respect you so much, Mandri, you keep them separate.”
Mandri wolfed down a peached chicken potsticker, then meekly agreed. He would have told Vigram what he really thought, but he really, really, needed the money.
Vigram clapped his hands and a nameless slave came in and took their empty plates, then the pair headed out to Vigram’s vine trellised, red-brick patio, where Vigram set himself to work in setting up an easel which he’d built himself. 
Mandri said, “Are you sure you want to do this here.”
“Why not?” asked Vigram. “Is there something wrong?”
“No. There’s nothing wrong, exactly. It’s that this light is going to make things so much more difficult.”
The patio’s trellis roof was not quite thick enough with vines, and that meant a richly dappled light would fall upon the sitter.
Vigram needed this explained.
Mandri said, “The sun moves, so these shadows will move…all these leafy shadows are going to be a whole other thing to worry about. It’s easier to learn one thing at a time. It’ll be easier if we keep to simple, clean light, that way there’s no shadows shapes drifting across the face when you’re trying to figure out which eye goes where.”
Vigram shook his head, and that sent his great brown beard wiggling as if it were alive. “My dear Mandri,” he said, “the patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
“I see. Well you can worry about ‘magical vestures’ when you’re good.”
“No,” said Vigram. “I won’t have it any other way. A magical vesture for a magical subject.”
As if bidden from the heavens by Vigram’s words, his daughter, Ora, joined them on the patio. She was Vigram’s favorite subject, Mandri’s age, the only one of the man’s five children willing to sit for him. 
“Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?” asked Vigram.
“Undoubtedly,” said Mandri.
Mandri’s eyes flicked to Ora without intention, but Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions. The old man’s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give his patriarchal blessing.
Mandri pretended he hadn’t noticed.
Ora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with a fertility goddess, but Mandri didn’t want to have children. But oh, her eyes. Impossible not to flirt with those sparkling umber eyes.
“Help her up,” Vigram commanded. “I’ll ready the canvas and palette.”
Mandri did as he was told and helped Ora up onto a high-legged stool. Ora let her fingers linger on his arm, and then Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.
Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.
Vigram picked up a stick of soft charcoal. He put down his first exploratory marks. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong too. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner’s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. He started drawing wherever his hand randomly landed and what happened next was up to Solraheen. The end result was that Ora’s head was, somehow, too small. It was also too left-of-center. There’d be an awkward expanse behind her flower-studded curls.
“Hold on,” said Mandri. “You’re moving too fast. Don’t think of this as a portrait—not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on the canvas. All you’re doing is putting an oval on the canvas.”
“Right.”
“So think about, where’s the best place to put that oval. Make use of the whole canvas.”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.
He stepped back.
He studied Ora.
He stepped again to the canvas.
Then he scratched a black oval right back where it had been.
“Is that better?” he asked without a hint of awareness.
“It needs to be a little bigger, I think.”
Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger. It was still a good ways off from where it needed to be.
Mandri encouraged the old man to continue, and from then on, almost every mark Vigram made was accompanied by a look back to Mandri for reassurance. 
“Don’t look at me, look at her.”
“Mandri, I need to know if it is right or if it is wrong.”
“Assume that it’s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it’s wrong, and then fix it.”
There was a glimmer of understanding in Vigram’s eye, but as soon as it came it faded. He twirled his beard in between his fat fingers, and then asked, “If the mark I make is always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I’ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.”
“You move on when you want to move on.”
“Then I want to move on. I’m here to paint, not draw.”
“Well, hold on. Finish…finish the basic shapes, at least.”
“Alright.”
Vigram ‘finished’ the ‘basic shapes’. He looked to Mandri for final approval.
“It’s your paint,” Mandri said with a shrug. “But you need to understand the importance of the drawing.”
“I do understand. You talk about it all the time. I just can’t do it.” Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.
Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first splotches of color in a flurry. The man was building was an affront to the senses, and Mandri couldn’t look away because he was getting paid to witness it. His world was forcibly narrowed to the canvas, which was hideous, Vigram, who was clueless, and Ora, who was eying Mandri up like he was her next meal. Mandri tried to avoid her at all costs, but he couldn’t help it; she was the sitter, the subject, and his eyes would have wander over her, and whenever they did, her smile would perk up. 
“Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.”
Vigram hid himself behind the canvas and gave Mandri another encouraging smile. This time his eyebrows jumped to emphasize the point.
Mandri said, “I’m not. I’m checking proportions.”
“If that’s what you’re doing, then tell me what you think.” 
Mandri took a pause to search for the right words to say. He knew what was wrong with the piece—he could write a treatise on it. He also knew that Vigram wouldn’t be able to handle an unvarnished critique. Almost no one can. If the man got upset, then there’d be no more money, and Mandri really, really needed the money. He was forced to compromise with himself and exercise restraint. He had to do what everyone else does: start off with a disarming compliment. Pick out something good to open the student up to critique. The problem, at present, was that there was literally nothing good there on cavas.
“It’s good,” said Mandri.
He sat back in his hip and made every honest effort to take in the observations that Vigram was putting down. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner’s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes—that can be done, but its very dangerous. Oils dry too slow to mess around. 
“Vigram…”
“I know, I know.”
“I’m gonna say it anyways. You need to get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the pallette is there for.” 
Vigram nodded, then began his work again in earnest. Mandri watched as the old man mixed a bluish shade of bronze for Ora’s chin. Unless there was some extraordinary circumstances of light and shadow—which there weren’t—it was a color meant for the chin a Jandri man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, “That’s not quite right.” He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, and he rubbed it into the manly chin.
That wasn’t quite right either. 
This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
“It’s not bad,” he said.
The charcoal lines looked like they were bleeding pus.
One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Ora’s left eye, and Vigram had an amusing go at it; it looked like a bandit’s eye-patch. 
“It’s good,” said Mandri. “No really, I mean it. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.”
“It’s on a path, that’s for sure.”
Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him fully into the work.
Mandri said, “Do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to learn to draw hands.”
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. He hadn’t even tried to draw Ora’s fingers. They were chicken scratches.
Mandri said, “If you aren’t going take what I say to heart, then what’s the point of me coming here?”
“I’m sorry, Mandri, but hands are too hard to paint. If a hand had one or two fingers it’d be a different matter entirely. As it is, they’re difficult things to draw.”
“Well, you can think of it as having three fingers. The middle two share a tendon so they tend to move together.”
“But then there’s the thumb.” Vigram sighed and shook his head. “The whole thing is just too much.”
“If you truly want to get better, you have to try, and trying means putting in the time and effort to learn how to draw hands.”
“I know.”
“The only things that matter are the face and the hands. You could give Ora forty ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
“You say that, but I feel like next time I come over you won’t have drawn a single hand.”
“Probably.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. If he didn’t need that money so damned bad, he’d have quit after the first session.
His little reverie was interrupted when one of Vigram’s men marched into the patio. He was a soldier with a puffed up chest, high strapped boots, a white plaited skirt, and a tall, knobbly spear—a poor imitation of a professional Hrkan soldier, though he did have the squarest chin that Mandri had ever seen.
The soldier stomped his foot and said, “Sorry to interrupt.”
“What is it?” Vigram asked.
“The young master’s ox is eating the apples.”
The soldier pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines, where some twenty meters away was Mandri’s only real possession: a skinny yellow ox named Gil. Gil was was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, but all it was doing was batting the ripened fruit around in circles.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said firmly. “He’s as much a human being as you or I.”
“Hah!”
“It’s true. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil and shouted, “Gil! Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. His protuberant eyes stared back through the vines, a dumb, bovine ogle. Slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. 
“Gil!”
Gil blinked.
Then he got distracted by the long, healthy grass brushing his belly. He bit off a mouthful and started to chew.
“Gil! Hup!”
A mastication later, and Gill was trotting towards the patio. The flap of his heavy dewflap rolled his short-hair hide back and forth over his sagging, aged spine.
“Poor old creature,” Vigram muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said.
Gill clopped into the patio as if it were his living room.
Ora slid off her chair and hurried behind Mandri and Vigram. Her intrepid hand brushed the back of Mandri’s arm.
Then the soldier lowered his spear and aimed it at Gil’s snout.
“Woah, woah, woah!” Mandri exclaimed as he pushed the spearhead away. “That is not necessary.”
Vigram nodded to the soldier and said, “Thank you, you’re dismissed.”
The soldier spun on his heel, and Mandri stared daggers into his back as he left.
“If he pricked Gil I’d have him up for attempted murder.”
Gill nuzzled up against Mandri’s shoulder.
Vigram eyed old Gil with disdain. “If Gil was eating my apples, I could have him up for thievery.”
“Ridiculous,” said Mandri. “Gil’s the nicest old ox you’ll ever meet. Watch this,” Mandri presented Vigram’s painting to Gil with a flourish, then asked his ox, “What do you think of Viggi’s painting?”
Gill looked at it.
He gave his grass a chew.
Then he mooed. 
“See!?” Mandri exclaimed.
“See what?” Vigram asked.
“He likes it.”
“No he doesn’t.”
Ora sauntered over to Gil and playfully scratched him into a cooing moo.
She said, “He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is.”
“Ora, what do you think of my painting?”
Ora eyed her father’s painting with suspicion. She stifled a smile.
“It’s not that bad, is it? Ora…It’s not that bad. Come now, I’ll have your honest opinion.”
Ora’s smile got bigger and bigger, and then she broke out in laughter when she realized exactly what Vigram had done to her.
“I look like a demon.”
“It’s not that grotesque.”
“It’s the hands,” said Ora. “They look like claws.”
The mention of hands put Vigram into full retreat. “I can’t paint hands!”
Ora laughed and prodded him on. “Why not?”
“Because I’m an old man! I don’t have the dexterity.”
“The dexterity?” Mandri asked.
“Painting hands is like doing needlework. Especially when I use this tiny brush. I don’t have the dexterity for it.” 
Mandri couldn’t help but smile at this newest excuse.
Then Ora said, with all the lust and must of a woman in heat, “Artists needs strong and dexterous hands, don’t they Mandri?” 
Mandri’s face lit up like she’d punched in the gut. This was the most upfront a girl had ever been, and right in front of her own father no less. Worse, Vigram was smiling like he was about to stamp a return on interest. 
Mandri said, “Uh…No…well, yes, but, uh… I don’t have any, uh, dexterity. I actually haven’t painted a portrait in more than two years.”
“Nonsense!” said Vigram. “I’ve seen you paint.”
“Demonstrations, sure, but that doesn’t really count.” 
“Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
Vigram rolled his eyes. “Look at you,” he said. “You’ve never farmed a day in your life.”
Before Mandri could answer, Vigram waved the matter out of the air with an open hand. “It’s time for lunch. I’ll come and get you two when it’s ready.”
With that, Vigram stomped his way into his villa’s anteroom, leaving Mandri alone with Ora and Gil.
It was a trap.
“Why don’t you paint anymore?” Ora asked.
Mandri made himself look busy by cleaning up Vigram’s mess. There was enough pigment left on the pallette for four more portraits.
“Uh…it would be too hard to explain.” He scraped a slap of yellow back into its clay vial.
“Try,” said Ora.
“Well, painting is, uh...”
Mandri tried to think of a palatable excuse, then he realized it was sitting right in his hands. “It’s too expensive. I mean, look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it’d take me months to afford all this. Your father makes this in a week.”
“You could make that much too if you came and worked for him.”
“I’m not good with money.”
“All you’d be doing is signing a scrap of paper every now and again.”
Ora picked up a dirty brush and twirled its horse-hair head through the muddy colors of the pallette.
She said, “You know, my dad doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for these lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t.”
“Is that how he feels about it?”
“Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. He’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”
“It’s a farm to me. And it’s a farm to Gil. Isn’t that right, Gil?”
Mandri’s attempt to bring Gil into the conversation was in vain, because Gil wasn’t even on the patio. He’d snuck out, and was on his way back up the hill to lick at that damned apple.
Purl twirled the paintbrush in between her fingers, feigning interest in its. She said, “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“What?”
“They say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“Couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
Mandri’s jaw dropped. 
“You want me to bare myself?”
Ora crossed her arms and gave Mandri a sly, expectant look.
Mandri said, “I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
“Why not?”
“You’re serious?”
“I’m a woman, Mandri. What’s your problem?”
Mandri was too thin to absorb blunt shock. He scrunched up his face and tried to pretend like he had no idea what was going on, but Ora was a girl trained in the art of bashful men. She saw right through it and made her move, grabbed Mandri’s arm and pulled him close to her. She caught his eyes and forced him to confront her lilac’d scent, her pounding heat, her smooth skin, her honeyed, aching lips.
“Ora…” 
Mandri knew he had to be very careful here.
“You’re a beautiful girl, but-”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No!—no.”
“I could be good for you,” she said.
“And what do you get out of it?”
She squeezed herself against him.
“You could be good for me,” she said. 
“You would not say that if you really knew me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
His eyes went wide at the sight of her mischievous smile, and the soft shadows of the vines just so happened to frame those sparkling umber eyes with the most magnificent golden light. A magical vesture indeed. 
Mandri nearly broke. He probably would have too, but Gil had finally reached his apple and let out a triumphant bellow. 
“MMMMRRRRUUUUUooooooooooOOOOOOOoooo!”
It was so loud and sickly that it startled Mandri and Ora out of their awkward embrace.
Mandri set Vigram’s palette down, and he backed up against the vines.
“Ora, this is not what I’m here for.”
“It’s what I’m here for,” said Ora.
Mandri looked for a means of escape. His eyes stumbled over a clear window pane. Vigram’s smiling face.
“Okay. I’m leaving.”
Mandri practically leaped off the patio.
Ora shouted after him, “What is wrong with you?”
Mandri did not answer. There was no point in answering. This was not what he was here for. He ran, then jogged, then walked, then stopped when he realized that he was forgetting something.
“Gil!”
But Gil was already trotting down villa’s gentle hill. Mandri waited up, and together they headed for villa’s swing gate.
Vigram was on their heels.
“What did you say to Ora?”
The old man was marching fast. His long beard was tucked under his arm to keep it from billowing up into his face.
“Nothing,” Mandri said. “I just walked away.”
“You walked away?”
“Look, Vigram, I don’t want to be a bother, but could I just get the money?”
Vigram frowned. He reached into his robe and pulled out a small brown sack of coin. He held it in the air like it was a treat for a dog.
He said, “Ora thinks you’re buying burgeons from Geem.”
“Burgeons?” asked Mandri.
“You deny it?”
“What would Ora know?”
“Do you deny it?”
“Of course I deny it.”
Vigram eyed Mandri like he was a theif. Then Vigram shook the bag of coin and said, “I want you to promise me that you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“I promise.”
Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, “I’m going to give you this money because I owe it. If I find out your using this for burgeons, then our arrangement here is finished. You won’t be coming back. And for Sol’s sake, buy some apples for old Gil here.”
“I will.”
Vigram put the coin in Mandri’s palm, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.
“You’ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. I’m serious. Solraheen’s given you a gift. It’s a sacred gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later, Viggi.”
Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. 
“I’m serious!” said Vigram. “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but few would be impressed if they watched him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he’d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. People only ever saw the finished product, those twenty-four strokes, and they assumed that Mandri’s brush went slip-slap-boom and there’s a true likeness. That story couldn’t be further from the truth. Mandri’s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and that’s a talent a person can lose; Mandri was living proof. 
When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram’s villa, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. The old man waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons, Mandri!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
Vigram shouted again. 
“They’ll douse your spark!”
Mandri wasn’t about to get into an argument at that kind of distance, so he waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle so they’d split too quick and insides would dry out before Mandri could get to them. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. 
Then Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the muddy wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back Mandri’s farm. </Text>
            <Notes>This piece really moves me — intro mandri description?

He was teh humblest humble that ever humbled.

Potential true artist = virtuosity — ‘contrary to popular belief’.

Intrepid fingers-intrepid hand

When he was ten, instead of, at the age of ten.

Insert servants hustling and bustling. Different ancient tasks.

Peached lizard legs.

At the very end, more punch, something like, guess thats the end of us and vigram.

            <Title>Pella's Sermon.</Title>
            <Text>
Pella found the two brothers squatting on top of the naked mage, sniffing scale oil from a wooden bowl. She startled them  from their little reverie with a question.
“Hasn’t woken up, has he?”
The two brothers, Jel and Goreet, looked at eachother with blank stares, and then at Pella. They really did look as much like lizards as humans could possibly look.
“I take it that’s a no?” Pella asked.
Trying to answer a question while high on scale oil was like trying to sprint through a tar field. The jaw just doesn’t work right. All the muscles in the head get gunked up, even the tongue. The brothers could never hold a conversation - they just hissed their way through them. Other than the high, the hissing was part of the reason why they sniffed so much scale oil, they thought it made them act more like lizards. 
So Jel and Goreet just smiled and nodded and hissed through the teeth that they’d filed to points. That was the closest they could come to looking friendly. No one ever smiled back. It wasn’t just the sharp teeth; long ago the brothers had  lopped off the tips of their noses so that they resembled reptilian slits, and a lifetime of sniffing scale oil had turned the whites of their eyes a grimy green-yellow. 
Pella rapped their shoulders with her cane to shoo them off the unconscious mage. She wanted to get a better look.
As Goreet stood up he pointed down at the mage, who was lying face down in the sand. It seemed to Pella that he wanted to show her something, but he could only get out three words: “Mage not man.”
“Mages are strange creatures,” Pella said, “but they’re still men nonetheless. Maybe this one is skinnier than usual, but mages don’t have to be fat. That’s a common misconception. It’s the quality of what’s in the stomach that matters, not how much is there. If a mage is skinny then he’s  probably quite powerful.”
She prodded the unconscious mage in the ribs. He was as skinny as a child, and looked barely older than one.
“Those glyphs tattooed on the skin aren’t normal either,” Pella said. “I’ve never seen anything like them.” 
Pella traced the outline of a large black symbol that was tattooed on the mage’s back. Everything but his neck, face, and forearms were writ with intricate arcane symbols. His skin otherwise was as white and pale as can be, almost transparent. There was no pinkish hue to him, though the stark, orange light of a campfire has a way of warping color, so she couldn’t tell for sure.
“Hand me a knife,” Pella grumbled. 
Goreet pulled a blade from his boot and held it out to Pella.
“Actually, you do it,” Pella said. “Split his wrist.”
Goreet squatted down and picked up the mage’s right arm. With his thumb steadying the flat back of the blade,  Goreet pushed his knife into the mage’s wrist like he was peeling a fat quava root. Dark blood poured out. 
Pella reached down, pulled the bleeding wrist from Goreet’s grasp to inspect. She had to push Goreet out of the way so that the flickering firelight could better catch the color of the blood.
It wasn’t red, or black like someone who’d spent too much time in the Samlan Waste. It was a deep, dark blue.
Pella stood up. The mage’s wrist slipped from her grasp and fell into the sand. She turned and held up her own fingers closer to the fire. A little blood had gotten on them, and it sparkled blue as she rolled her fingers round.
“This can’t be right,” she mumbled.
She looked back at the mage. Goreet and Jel were standing over him. If they were surprised by the blue blood their numbed faces wouldn’t have be able to show it. They didn’t seem to care. They had turned the mage over, put him belly up, and Goreet had kicked his legs apart so that Pella could get a good view at the naked mage’s crotch. 
There wasn’t anything there. 
Goreet was pointing at the absence of flesh, and repeated what he had said earlier.
“Not man.”
The mage’s groin, from the belly all the way down, was completely smooth, just like a statue carved out of the age of Zeladeen when artists were so concerned with decency that they skipped the sex organs altogether.

INSERT bit where someone says they saw him raising his arms, swirling hands/using hands to summon magic. Pella is like OH SHIT.

“What kind of creature are you?” Pella wondered aloud. She stood like that for a moment, as if contemplating the best way to run. Eventually she grunted and told the brothers to tie their captive to a staff. 
Gorett took his own oak spear and planted it in the ground. Pella shook her head.
“No. I mean put it on his shoulders and bar his arms apart. We need to splay them out, keep his hands from doing anything.”
By now a few other Ayramun had wandered over to see what was going on. Seculla seemed the most interested of the lot. She was kneeling next to the mage’s body, trying her best to divine the meaning of the intricate tattoos. Out in the desert, tattoos are ugly things, scratched and scrawled and imprecise. The fractal patterns on the mage’s chest were cleaner, sharper, than a human hand could make, and each pattern was composed of smaller patterns, tiny swirling lines, that seemed thinner than any needle write.
 Pella rapped Seculla’s outstretched arm with her cane.“Careful child,” she said. “You were born in the empire - don’t you recognize what he is?”
“No,” said Seculla.
“What is he?” someone else asked.
A few more Ayramun were crowding around now and their long shadows cut up the light. There were seven of them standing there, including Pella. The rest of the twenty-five Ayramun who had survived were spread about the cave, dealing with the loss of their friends in their own private ways. Some shed tears, some tried to make busy to keep from thinking about it, but most were just too tired to do anything but lay down with a pipe of freeweed and be with themselves in silent grief. 
Pella wondered how many of them were thinking thoughts of giving it all up. She knew she had to do something. The moment seemed ripe for a sermon.
“Just tie him up,” Pella said, “then bring him closer to the fire. And where’s Elrahet?”
“Bitch sulks in Underworld. Where she belong, I think.”
Pella spun round to see little Hill. The man was only four and a half feet tall, but he was Pella’s biggest annoyance. She was about to smack him in the throat with her cane, but Seculla leapt to Elrahet’s defense first. 
“Elrahet didn’t do this.”
“Who else?” Hill asked.
“It was him,” Seculla said, pointing to the mage. Goreet had propped him up and was holding him steady while Jell tied his scrawny arms up to the haft of the spear.  “At least I think it was him,” Seculla said. “I saw him raise his arms to the sky, and that’s when...I saw a flash come from his body.”
“Bullshit,” Hill snorted. “I saw a bolt come down from storm. Elrahet’s storm.”
“Elrahet is what saved us” Pella said. “Believe me when I say this creature would have killed us all.”
“What is he then?” Hill asked, but Pella did not answer. She instead motioned for the Lizard brothers to stop 
“That’s tight enough. Now bring him over to the fire. And someone with a heart go fetch Elrahet out of the dark.”
Pella liked to say that to be an Ayramun was to be tied to a wheel of pain the size of a calendar year. As it revolves it grinds the Ayramun into the frenzy of the fight, it mixes them with all the excitement and passion they can handle - but then it keeps rolling along and suddenly they’re pulled right out of the blood and guts and into interminable boredom of waiting for it all to come back around. Sometimes it’s more than a year until the next bit of action, sometimes it’s much less. The way the Ayramun operated meant there’d never be too much risk and so there’d always be too much waiting. It was only bearable because they never lost. But now, they’d lost half their number, and Ayram was unconscious on the floor of their cave.
To make matters worse, the blast that killed their friends had also destroyed the caravan’s wagons and whatever was in them. The pickings were so poor that they could fit inside a single man-sized sack. Only Mandri and Purloin bothered to sort it all. The two were busy at it by the fire.
“Still not found a scrap of gold,” Purloin complained as she pulled a half-shattered iron cookplate out of the bag.
“Not a fleck of it,” Mandri affirmed. 
Purloin, called Purl, was such a waifish, half-starved looking thing that she made Mandri look well-fed. She was also missing her right arm, a fact which leaned into the running joke that time was turning her into a lockpick, being so thin, knobby, and unbalanced as she was.
Mandri had already given up hope that there was anything valuable tucked inside the few rusted tinboxes he was pulling out of the bag. There was only the affects of men roughing it on long march: melted sticks of lye soap, cheap coins, spoons, and little levers for handmills. Junk. 
Mandri grew more and and more frustrated by the sight of each new trifle.
“I even scoured that crater,” he said. “Not a fleck of gold in it. Gold should have survived that blast. If a tin-box and barrel bands survived, gold should have.”
“No gold,” Purl moaned. “Even if we melt this all down, it comes to what?”
Mandri shook his head in disgust. “It’s not worth thirty Ayramun, that’s for  damned sure. This shit ain’t worth lookin’ at.”
Mandri stuffed the tinboxes back into the loot bag and tightened the drawstring as tight as he could. He then laced the opening so that nothing could fall out - not that it mattered if anything fell out.
“Honestly, we should toss this trash,” he said.
“It’s worth something,” Purl argued.
“Well I’m not hauling it. You gonna do it? You can hardly carry yourself.”
“I’ll get someone to help,” Purl said defensively.
“Get who? There’s like ten of us left.  All the stuff we need to carry, and you want to carry this shit?”
Purl’s sunken eyes glared out at Mandri. “I ain’t leavin’ that ambush with nothin’ to show for it!” she snapped. “You wanna leave thirty dead friends for nothin’, you go ahead. But I’ll make them count for somethin’, and I’ll bet theres at least one other who does too.”
Mandri shrugged off Purl’s indictment with a smile.“But that only makes it worse, doesn’t it,” he said. “Thirty dead for a pocket of silver somehow feels worse than thirty dead for nothin.” 
Purl rose to her feet and pointed her finger at Mandri. Her voice was thick with acrimony as she accused him of having no heart. “I bet you don’t even care and never did. You don’t like anyone. You say it all the time. I bet you don’t even care that Sentee, Cally, and Poor are dead. What are you even here for?”
“Oh, I don’t care?”
Mandrameen’s leather bag of scrolls was nearby, the one’s with the stories of the Ayramun. He reached in and grabbed a handful of them, and right of the top was Sentee’s. Hers was a familiar story - cast out into the Sand because of something she’d done. Then picked up by Ayram.
Mandri pointed out the thick letters he’d printed at the top of the page to Purl.
“You see this?” he asked her.  “This spells ‘Sentee’.”
He tossed the scroll into the fire.
Purl crossed her arms and feigned indifference.
“Ah yes, here’s Cally too. And Poor. And Jor, Iltwin, and For. They’re all dead, too. Won’t need these then. ”
“What are you doing!?” Purl shouted as Mandri made to toss them into the flames. Mandri stood there with a quizzical frown.
“Well, you say I don’t care, then I guess I don’t care. Spent all this time getting to know them, but your right, it doesn’t mean anything.”
“The hell is wrong with you?”
“You almost seem more upset at me for tossing these papers away, than at Ayram for tossing away their actual lives.”
The gall of Mandri’s words echoed around the cave, pricking the ears of any Ayramun who were trying to shut out the bickering. One by one they turned their eyes turned to the fire, squinting in disbelief, wrinkling their noses at the stink of Mandri’s insinuation.
Purl, for her part, was trying piece together what Mandri had just said. She’d heard him alright, but like the others, couldn’t believe he went at Ayram like that. She even tried to repeat the words, to dress them up with derision and trivialize the matter, but found she couldn’t do it. To blame Ayram for anything, when you knew him, was impossible. 
Mandri was starting to get a sense for the attention he was drawing to himself. 
“What? I’m just saying that it’s weak to try to make them that’s dead mean something when they don’t. Accept that they’re dead and they died for nothin.  Accept facts as facts - Ayram screwed up, put us out on bad info, and then people died. We lost. And when you lose you don’t get somethin’ for it so stop tryin’ to get it.”
“We didn’t lose,” Purl said through clenched teeth. 
Mandri laughed. “This sure as hell ain’t winning. What would you call this empty cave? Seems like a whole lot of losing to me.”
“We didn’t lose because this ain’t over.”
“And just what is all twelve pounds of Purloin the bone-bag going to do to the Empire?” Mandri asked.
“I’m going to do what Ayram said we’d do.” 
“Ayram? You still believe in him? In one night we’ve lost half of what we’ve gained in twenty years.”

The weight of the attention thrown at the fire knocked the two out of their little spat. But Mandrameen was a pure-blooded Jandrian, proud and resolute to the last. He would stand by his convictions. His voice rose to challenge the heightened tension.
“I’m not interested in merely surviving out here, if you can call this surviving,” he said. “If we’re going to die by the dozens, we should to be closer to Jeket, closer to the people whose lives we’re trying to change.”
Pella was near to the fire. Close to him. She was looking right through his skull with the eyes of a hungry lion.
“Yesterday, there was what, fourty of us? Today there’s fourteen. There’s over a million people in Jeket! Five hundred thousand spread out on the coast near Shul. We’re not the ones who are going to toss the Empire out of Jandri. If the war is going to be won, its the people who are going to do it.”
Pella spat into the flames.
“It’s Ayram that’s going to win this war,” she said. “I spent twenty years, longer than you’ve been alive, trying to stir Jeket into fury. Jeket… Jeket had a hundred years to do something about the terrors inflicted on them.”
Mandri scoured the blinking darkness for a sympathetic face. He need just one pair of eyes to match his gaze, to share his confidence and give it right back redoubled. But he couldn’t see well enough into the dark. If there was any agreement there, it was hidden in the shadows of their faces. There was only Purl and Pella. They, and the mage, were the only ones near enough to the fire for Mandri to read.
“You know, I used to be you,” Pella said. “Young and ignorant. Using every ‘mistake’ leadership makes as a prop for your own ideas. You just haven’t lived long enough to be disappointed by how the world works. I won’t hold it against you. But you need to shut up now.”
“Where’s the gold, Pella?”, Mandri asked.
“Sit down, boy.”
“I’m only asking a question. Where’s the gold?”
Pella “The gold is right here you idiot!”
“The mage?” Mandri asked.
“The MAZYDEI!” Pella croaked.
All eyes turned to the naked mage. The Mazydei. The Spark of the Schisma Guilds. General of the Empire. The most powerful being on the continent. To a cultish band on the edge of the continent trying to strike a blow to the Empire, he was the most valuable thing in the world.
“Yes. You sad, pitiful creatures.” Pella said. She then mocked their complaints. Not just Mandri either. She paced up and down the fire, scanning the darkness for sad faces as she mocked their wekness. “Boo-hoo, there’s no gold! All these deaths with nothing to show for it. I’m sorry to burst your pity party, but we’ve got a Mazydei in our midst. Does that not liven you up a little bit? Oh, now you’re speechless, Mandri? Does this not meet your criteria for success?”
Mandri’s mind was reeling at the revelation that there was a Mazydei on the floor of their cave. He’d only ever seen a Mazydei once, when he was a little boy. A Mazydei general led an Imperial column through the streets of his city of Belize. But that Mazydei had been a giant - ten feet tall and as stout as an ox. The twiggy creature that lay there helpless in the sand seemed another kind of thing altogether.
“But he’s so small,” Mandri muttered in disbelief.
“Yes, that’s why I missed it at first,” Pella said. “But make no mistake. This is no man or woman. See here -” She pointed the mage’s smooth crotch, at the absence of genitalia. Then she pointed to it’s belly. “And no belly button either. This thing was made, not born. And you all saw what it was doing on the Juneii road. Summoning power with its hands. Not power through the stomach, through words. Not power through blood. Power through its hands. Only one kind of creature can do that. Only one kind of creature does that while marching in a column of Imperial elites. A Mazydei. Why he’s so small, I don’t know.”
“What is he doing out here?” came another.
“I’ve no idea.”
Silence. Pella got annoyed at the silence. A headless chicken. Wished they’d take a little more initiative.

“I haven’t given a sermon in more than thirty years. Not since my time as Nearest to the Emperor. Not since Ayram found me half-dead in a cell in Uttariz. I haven’t preached because Ayram’s always been here to whip your souls into shape. You’ve never needed to hear what I have to say.”
“And I mean what I really have to say. Not the chirps and dangles to cure your spits of laze. I’m talking bout the kinds of things that got me this -” She pointed at the old scar which wrapped around her neck.
“So now Ayram’s hurt, and some of you… not just Mandri… I look around and see the sorriest set of faces I’ve ever seen. It’s sad that an old shit like me, with a foot in the grave, demands less pity. Is that what you want? More pity? Is that what you’ve been fighting for this whole time, to get a bit of pity for your troubles?”
“Sure, sure, you can grieve. Or, you could steel yourselves and be Ayramun.”


“One of the eight. Maybe this one is the ninth. And here he is, kneeling before us. My younger self would quivered at the thought. A impossible dream, but here he is.” 
All eyes turned to the Mazyd. Dawning apprehension. Of course he was no mage, no mage looked like him.
“Maybe you understand, now, why there’s no time for grief, much less pity. It’s a time for action. It’s always a time for action, but maybe now you fools can see it.”
They all just stare at the Mazyd for a moment. There was hushed silence as all eyes turned towards the mage. He was hunched over his knees, arms splayed out behind him, tied to the staff. The side of his face was flat against the dirt. The black patterns on his back seemed to shift as the firelight shifted. This had not been a defeat. They’d capture the most valuable thing in existence.
“What do we do with him?”
“He stirs!”
Pella looked over, and indeed the Mazyd was moving. Before, his breathing had been almost imperceptible, but now his whole back and ribs were heaving, filling his lungs with air. Pella hobbled around him to get a look at his face. His eyes were blinking wearily, as if the even weak light of the campfire was too much for them to take. 
“He’s waking up!” Pella exclaimed. “Good! Good. 


“Yes. A Mazydei. You all know what they are - weapons of war. But for me they are something simpler, yet more powerful. They’re proof of a simple and incontrovertible truth - that the rich and powerful are not so powerful as we. Think of it: kings, queens, and little princes are so scared of us, so scared of losing control that they resort to pulling abominations like this one the void to serve them. But shadows of power can only birth shadows of power.”
Pella was reaching into her memory now. Her final sermons.
“Kings. Queens. Princes. They strut around in parades and give gifts to eachother and genuflect in scripted rituals designed to reinforce the pyramid of power, but it's all a sham, because underneath their blue satin sashes are squishy necks that are slit just as easily as any other.”
Pella stabbed the Mazydei’s torso with her cane for effect.
“They try to pretend that they are special. Kings. Queens. Princes. They pretend that they’re not born swimming in afterbirth like the rest of the human race. They imagine that they’re born clean and powdered, that their skin is softer and better suited for the deep blue velvet. That their pudgy little hands know just what to do with a diamond encrusted rattle. The narrative of their lives is crafted even as they sleep; I’ve seen it myself: slim little courtesans leaning over royal cribs, whispering, ‘Doesn’t she look exactly like a little queen?’. The rest of the howling babes grow up into common folk. Into You. Into me. And what is our lot, according to them? According to him.”
Pella prodded the Mazyd again as she said it. No one answered her.
“Well go on. What is our lot?” Pella asked again.
It was Hill who ansered. “To endure them!” he shouted.
“Endure and obey,” Pella corrected. “They claim that it if it wasn’t the will of Sol for us to be poor, for us to suffer, then it would not be so. They claim that they have all the money, land, and pleasure because it is Sol’s will. After all, if that wasn’t true, then it would not be so!”
Boos.
“But it’s not Sol’s will that takes grain out of the mouths of the poor. It’s not even the paid thugs and traitors who do it. It’s not Sol who pulls the Mazydei out from the pit of Hell. It’s Kings, Queens, and Princes.”
By now the Mazyd was coming to. His head was off the ground. His back was arched. His eyes were open. Pella was too rapt up in her sermon to notice it.  
“It doesn’t take a brilliant mind to see through it. It takes a hungry one.  Every time a fat king refuses to buy grain at the ancient price, or debases the currency to pay for his wars of vanity, or kicks out a Jandrian tribe from sacred land -“
More boos. A few disorderly shouts and curses.
“You know what happens. Yes! You are what happens ! Hold on, Tenny, put your knife away. Someone take Tenny’s knife from him.”
“I don’t like the way he looks!” Tenny shouted.
Once order was restored, Pella continued on with her sermon.

“This pitiful dried cunt is a Mazydei. Light of the Empire. Wise and powerful. The culmination of centuries of art, alchemy, and fleshcraft, stretching all the way back to the great Saulistides. Leaders of men. Immortal. But the thing you really need to know is this: do not trust them. You think you’ve neutered the beast because you’ve cut off his hands, but his most potent weapon is his tongue. ”
“Mazydei never lie.”
“Yes. Sure. You can trust their naked words. Trust their statements of fact, sure. But you can’t trust them. Trust me when I say that there is deceit behind every truth they tell.”
At that the Mazydei spit a wad of blue blood at Pella’s feet.
“Oh? Something to say, demon?”
“That’s not true.”
“Coming to your defense?”
“We do not lie. We are not deceitful.”
Pella let out one of her usual apathetic grunts. “Hah!”
“
“Tell me, child, what is your name?”
“Mazyd Oro.”
“Mazyd Oro…”  Pella repeated. The name fell out of her mouth like she was already bored of hearing it. She looked over to the rest of the Ayramun and brought them into the conversation with familiar shitbagsihds. “It means Eighth Light. That’s what it means. Mazyd Oro. Eighth Light. They number themselves like that. There used to be only seven Mazydei. I’ve met all of them. But here they’ve gone and made another.” She turned back to Oro. “So, Oro - and you’ll forgive me if I dispense with formality here…Mazyd Oro is too much for me. So, Oro, do you know who I am?”
This time Oro spoke up. There was a tinge of disgust in his voice.“You were once Nearest to the Emperor.”
“And my name?”
“I will not say it.”
A stifled laughter rumbled throughout the cave. The Ayramun took pride in their surrogate mother. Here she was, a woman who demanded respect from even the Empire’s greatest. 
But Pella didn’t laugh. She didn’t even smile. Pyetle wondered if she even could.
“You know,” Pella said, “I’ve always wondered about your numbering. First Light, Eighth Light… If the Mazydei’s names are ordered like that then there has got to be some purpose to it. Maybe there’s a hierarchy - but that never made sense because you all seem to be interchangeable. One day I would be dealing with Mazyd Elay, and the next day it was Mazyd Por, with no variance in their abilities, knowledge, or affect. It was as if they were the same entity, occupying different bodies. So, and you’ll have to tell me if this is true, do you number yourselves just to cater to our silly human sensibilities?”
“I wouldn’t call it silly,” Mazyd said.
“You don’t think an ineffiecent cultural artifact like naming is beneath you?”
 “Names are practical things.  How else would you distinguish one person from another?”
“But is there any point in distinguishing one Mazydei from another?”
“Would we do it if there was no point?”
“That’s what I want to know. Ever since I was a little girl I’ve suspected that the Mazydei are one being. One being, but putting on a front for us humans. You know, ‘This is Mazyd Oro and this is Mazyd Pel’, but really, you’re all the same mind. Is that how it is?”
“Not exactly, no.”
“Then how is it, exactly?”
“I can not say.”
“Oh?”
“It is impossible to condense our nature into something you could grasp. Any attempt would only create more misapprehension than is already there.”
“Same, same, Mazydei. Never change Mazydei.  You think you’re better than us. No. You know  you’re better than us. But just look at you. And you’re supposed to be an improvement, no? You’re the newest version. The Eighth. The best the Empire has to offer, yet here you are, reduced to a dry, quivering cunt. But you’ve got this… this blindness to your own faults. Just look at you. You’ve lost. You’ve lost everything that matters but .No one likes the smell of their own shit more than a Mazydei.”
“We do not shit.”
“Oh?”
“We literally do not shit.” 
“Oh, it’s not coming out of your asshole, idiot.”
Theres a kind of stillness when Pella didn’t get the laugh she was expecting.
“She means that the shit is coming out of his mouth. See its a play on words because she’s saying it’s coming out of his mouth. His words are shit.”

“I don’t mean to cause offense.”
Whatever profane concoction the guild uses to brew your minds, it goes a little heavy on the arrogance. You would be formidable if you were more modest. Folks would like you more.



Getting your skull caved in is the worst way to lose track of time. Next worst is a night of fitful sleep, but of course that doesn’t compare. Sleep can be said to be a lived experience inasmuch as one’s dreams are remembered.  Even without them, the passage of time is always somehow estimated so that as soon as you step out of bed there is that sublime sensation of being reinserted into the natural flow of things - not so with a knockout blow.
More to the point, there’s the pain.
When Ayram came to, there was a dull, throbbing ache that radiated out from the top of his head where the rock had cracked open his skull. He brought his hand up to the wound and dabbed it gingerly with his fingers. They trembled upon a smattering of dried blood which had matted his hair. He then continued to follow the pain to its source, near the crown of his skull. There he found that he could push down on a flap of skin and a cracked bit of bone. As he traced the outline of the cavity, a sharp pain shot out and ran around to the back of his head, constricting his skull like a python. 
        He must have been out for hours. Maybe days. He had no way of knowing 
Oddly, it was still raining.
        “You’re awake!”
        It was old Pella. She rushed to his side.
        “We were set up!” she said.
        “What?” Ayram asked, confused even as to how he was alive.
“It was a setup! There was no gold!” Her raspy voice was quivering with excitement and rage.
Ayram tried to blink the blur out of his vision. He was in a cave somewhere high in the mountains.
“How long was I out?”, he asked.
“For the better part of a day… There was no gold, Ayram.” 
Ayram winced, half in pain, half in exasperation.
“What happened?” he asked.
“That storm that Elrahet magic’d up conjured a bolt… bigger than any I’ve ever seen... it took out the entire caravan. It took out Papillian and Colm, too, and nearly you. But that magus survived!” Pella pointed to the naked figure who lay crumpled and unconscious near the cave’s mouth. His pale body was covered in black glyphs and arcane symbols. Blood pooled around him.
“He has not yet awoken. I haven’t told the boys yet, but he’s no mere magus. We cut
off his hands… I think he’s one of the Emperor’s Salisians,” Pella said. “Only four Salisians in the world, and one of them is here... He was here to kill us! Ayram, we were set up!”
Ayram struggled to take it all in.
“Who was your man in Jeket?!” Pella asked, stressing the urgency of the moment. 
“Who baited us into this?”
Ayram closed his eyes and gritted his teeth.
“A man named Salavan Saran.”

            <Text>It is pleasant to ascend to the summit of that tower, which dominates the landscape. This I generally do in the evening, after supper, in the bright moonlight. Today I have com ewith the ambition of jotting down my impressions, for the specatcle moves me deeply.
Seen from below, it does not look so high as might be expected of a babylonian temple tower. Did noot that of babylon pretend to reach the heaven? On cets teh answer after ascending it. 
… from the top the eye sweeps over an enourmace distance on the boundless, flat plain. Nothing breaks the view, and the plain finally melts into the horizon. About twenty miles away rises the high mound of cutha. This city was sacred to nergal, the god of pestilence and of the underworld. The ruins of babylon are nearer. All around the tower small heaps of dirt represent all that remains of kish, one of the oldest cities of mesopotamia.
On all sides is desert. The yellowish soil is arid and thirsty, and no plant can survive the parching heat of the summer; sheep and camels must feed on whatever r emains of the grass that has managed to sprout in the few weeks after the rains. The large network of canals, which in ancient times distributed the waters of the euphrates over all this land, is now represented by a  series of small mounds of dirt, running in all directions. Even the euphrates has abandoned this land by changing its course. In ancient times it came very near to the city, giving water in abundance and affording an easy way of communication.
But man has not yet forsaken this place and still tries to wrest something from the avaricious ground.  A mile away an arab peasant, chanting a plaintive song, is urging on two skinny donkeys that pull a primitive plow. He is placing his trust in the coming rains, hoping these may help multiply the few grains of barley that he will throw into the shallow furrow. If the rains should fail, so will the bread in his house. He works without energy, and the plow wriggles uncertainly over the plain.
Immediately before me, and all around the tower, are the deep trenches made during last year’s excavations… at night, with a full moon, they appear pitch black and bottomless - a line o fdefense around the sacred mountain, ready to swallow whoever should attempt to approach it. The sun has just now disappeared, and a purple sky smiles, unmindful of this scene of desolation. The cool evening breeze attempts to tear away from my hand the sheet of paper on which I write these notes.

A dead city! I have visited pompeii and ostia, and I have taken walks along the empty corridors of the palatine. But those cities are not dead: they are only temporarily abandoned. The hum of life is still heard, and life blooms all around. They are but a step in the progress of that civilization to which they have contributed their full share and which marches on, under their very eyes.
Here only is real death. Not a column or an arch still stands to demonstrate the permanency of human work. Everything has crumbled into dust. The very temple tower, the most imposing of all these ancient constructions, has entirely lost its original shape. Whare are now its seven stages? Where the large stairway that led to the top? Where the shrine that crowned it? We see nothing but a mound of earth - all that remains of the millions of its bricks. On the very top some traces of walls. But these are shapeless: time and neglect have completed their work.

Under my feet are some holes which have been burrowed by foxes and jackls. At night they descend stealthily from their haunts in their difficult search for food, and appear silhouetted against the sky. This evening they appear to sense my presence and stay in hiding, perhaps wondering at t his stranger who has come to disturb their peace. The mound is covered with white bones which represent the accumulated evidence of their hunts.
It is beinning to be really dark, and the plaintive song of the arab has ceased. Nothing breaks the deathly silence. Cutha and babylon have been swallowed by the darkness.in the distance some lights appear. Farther away is an ecampment of beduins, here considered as enemies. To us they represent an element of danger, for they are born thieves. But I who have accpeted their hospitatlity and drunk their coffee, made with dirty water and served in cups that are never washed, cannot call them enemies. They have been so trusting that they even let me take some photographs of them, a favor rarely obtained from the beduins of the desert; 
A jackal is now sending forth his howl, half-cry and half-threat. All the dogs of the arab village immediately take up his challange, and for a moment the peace is upset by howling and barking. 
I should like to find a reason for all this desolation. Why should a flourishing city, the seat of an empire, have completely disappeared? Is it the fulfilment of a prophetic curse that changed a superb temple int oa den of jackals? Did the actions of the people who lived here have anything to do with this, or is it the fatal destiny of mankind that lall its civilizations must crumble when they reach their peak? And what are we doing here , trying to wrest from the past its secrets, when probably we ourselves and our own achievents may becom an object of search for peoples to come?
Still absorbed in my thoughts, I feel no desire to break up their course by joining my friends. 
The ground is soft, being made up entirely of the debris of centries, and at times my foot sinks ini t up to the ankle. Here the ancient habitations with their mysteries and their tombs, have been sleeping quietly for milleniums.



The relative importance of archeological results has come to be identified more and more with the intrinsic worth or  the artistic value of teh objects found.  No scholar needs t obe told that t his is a mistake.  The plan of a building, the special pattern or decoration of a lowly clay vessel, a few lines of inscription hardly visible on a rock or a tablet, frequently add much more to scientivic knowledge than  a hoard of gold or silver objects. 

It takes a long time for new discoveries to escape from the incomprehensible scientific books and articles which first discussed them and to find their place in those genral works on history….

In egypt stone is plentiful, and the great pharoahs utilized it for temple and pyramid, imperishable testimonies to their names. Even had egypts history not been practically continuous, …. In mesopotamia on the other hand, stone hardly exists. Some sort of gypsum is found in the north, and this was used by kings in decoration.

When the central covernment became too weak or too poor to take proper care of the network of canals that irrigated the land, large tracts of fertile territory were converted into a desert almost overnight, and whole cities had to be abandoned. The roofs of teh buildings caved in, and teh core of the huge wallls, no longer protected, was exposed to the rain. Water slowly worked in; the bricks began to swell up, and the walls to crack and fall. After a few rainy seasons, the upper part of the walls completely disintregrated and left merely a mound of dirt to mark the site of a once splendid palace.

In egypt conditions were entirely different. The dry climate, the very scanty rainfall, and the fact that the sands would not absorb and hold moisture have all collaborated in favor of the archeologists; bits of papyri buried in the sand have been found in perfect condition after thousands of years. 

An immense hole was dug in the ground, and the tomb was placed within it as deep as possible. After the burial ceremonies had been completed, the ground was again leveled off, and very soon all traces of the exact spot disappeared completely. How the robbers found it out is a mystery to me, but they did find it.

Because of the moisture, all perishable objects would disintegrate and be destroyed in the course of a few decades. What survive to our day are objects of gold, silver, copper, and stone. Of the royal chariots are found only the nails that fastened the leather strips around the wooden wheels and some bits of decoration, the bones of the animals, and the metal bits in their mouths.

Clay is practically indestructible. If it is of good quality and has been baked, everyone knows that it can withstand the elements without suffering the least.

Good clay keeps beter. Process was simple, the clay was placed in water and stirred. All bits of wood, straw, leaves, and the like floated on top and could easily be thrown away. Little pebbles, sand, or other impuriteis sank and immediately deposited themselves at the bottom of the vessel. After the water is removed the top part of the clay was free of impuriteis. But this process was generally unnecessary. The rivers themselves deposited almost yearly a good stratum of clay along their banks. Floating impurities had already been carried away by the receding waters or deposited here and there in shallow pools.

— clay from teh jade river is the best clay in all the world. Workmen wading in the freshly laid mud, scooping up with their hands the top clay, and piling it in little mounds to be taken away; it was evidently reserved for fine pottery. Coarser clay mixed with chopped straw and used for making bricks.

A little brick of clay, if in pure condition adn well kneaded, may lie buried in the moist ground for thousands of years and not only retain its shape but harden again, when dried, to the same consistency as before. If covered with writing, as is generally the case with babylonian tablets, one can take the small unbaked tablet and brush it vigorously with good stiff brush without the slightest fear of damaging its surface. All adhering impurities, with the exception of some mineral salts, are brushed away. If the salt incrustations should be too many and render decipherment impossible, then all one has to do is bake the tablet throughly. After baking, it can be immersed in water, subject to acids ore even boiled, and it will be as fine and clean as on the day it was first made.
Clay drying it shrinks considerably.
When clay tablets are placed in a jar, and buried in wet ground, they will gradually absorb moisture and swell. The tablets become too large for the jar, but the best they can do is to push into every avaialble cranny until finally their shapes are completely distorted. An arch who comes upon a jar like that will be wise and not attempt to extricate the tablets before they have had a chance to dry out completely and shrink again. Even after this, the now distorted documents may be difficult to remove without damage. May have to break the jar.
Worse is their fate if, while they are soft in the moist ground, they find themselves in the path of small rodents or earthworms. Many earthworms who lived perhaps a millennium ago, have immortalized themselves through their work. Int he course of their wanderings underground they encouter a tablet. Less determined worms feeling their way all along the surface hoping to find a soft spot, left a long welt with the complete destruction of whole lines of writing.

When I first started excavating, I tried different systems, but htere is only one that I can recommend. As soon as found, the tablet must be cleaned of the surrounding dirt before being touched with the hand. When its condition is such that it can be handled, it should be picked up carefully, wrapped in thin paper, and wrapped again in heavier paper. Then the little bundle - on which all indications as to provenience, date, and the like, ahve been recoreded promptly - should be taken into a house and left to dry slowly in the shade for at least fifteen days. Since it will shrink, the packages will beocome quite loose and cannot be handled at all. After fifteen days hte tablet can be re-wrapped in the final package since by that time it has already shrunk to its original size. At no time should the tablet be exposed to the sun, either wihile being extricated or when in its original package. It will dry too quickly and go to pieces. At no time should the tablet be exposed to the sun, either while being extricated or when in its package. It will dry too quickly and go to pieces. 

A large part of the land is made up of silt carried down by the rivers from the mountains to the north.  So much more silt has been carried down since the time when they joined their forces that the gulf today is ninety miles away from the junction.

Since much of the country has been made by the deposits of the rivers, it is necessarily quite flat. The streams could never pile up dirt in the shape of a hill.

From one large canal other canals branched off, carrying surplus water wherever it was needed; still smaller irrigation ditches swung off from the secondary canals until the whole land was a web of watercourses. Canals were perennial monuments to the wisdom and paternal care of the men who boasted of having built them.

The mound of megiddo (“armageddon”) scene of many battles, views a peaceful procession of natives.

How do archaeologists find the ancient city? Every mound of dirt is a city. I have yet to find a place in the land of iraq, except in the newly formed delta, on which one can stand and not see two or three cities clearly outlined on the horizon. The worry is not how to find one, but which to choose.



-multiple cities in one spot
The people had to contend with a flat land which might at any time be inundated by the rivers. A very common precaution, therefore, was to build a little mound of clay that would raise the foundations of the houses a trifle above the level of the ground. We thus have beginning of the mound. The houses were built with walls of unbaked bricks and plastered with clay. The roofs of the private dwellings were generally thatched and covered with a thick layer of clay that prevented the rain from filtering through. Each year, the plaster on the outside walls had to be renewed. The roofs also got a fresh coating of clay. All the clay that had been washed down from walls and roof was depositedi nthestreet, so the street level gradually increased in height. 
Also, no provision for the disposal of refuse, if one ate shellfish, the shells were thrown into the street to remain there. If a change was made in the plan of a house, all the bricks would go into the street. I had to go up and down over little mounds of bricks and mortar that had been thrown into the street from houses. Adobe houses are relatively short-lived, after a certain time the walls beginto cave in, and the expense of keeping them reparied is more than that of tearing htem down adn rebuildingo n the same site - new house is necessarily a little higher.

Koran explains sumerian tablets - ‘bricks baked in hell and written by demons.’

Figuring out language - the work was necessarily slow because in those times communication was more difficult than today, and many months were wasted by individiual scholars on problems which had already been solved by their colleagues working independently. But eventually the scholars were able to announce that one of the versions had been read and that it was written in Old Persian. 
(Mazyd saying, biggest problem is communication - two people too far apart may be working on a problem that has already been solved. This is hugely inefficient.)

Inscriptions in the cornerstones of ancient walls. Done differently - in the nails pressed into the brick. - so that kings who built on later couldn’t take credit for its origination.

You cannot expect a man toconsume his time and money in telling the world that he has been defeated. Let the enemy do that! He will talk about his own victories, or rleate his story in such a way that a defeat will seem to hae been a victory. If the first battle of a chicago king is won at new york, the second a t philadelphia, and the fifth at pittsburgh, it is quite evident that the army is really retreating. The leader does not dare to tell the truth. If half the opposing army is destroyed in the first battle, an equal amount in the third, a large number in the fourth, and there are still more nemies to keep the king out campaigning, obviously there is a misrepresentation somewhere.

Pg 107 - ‘little curvy clay sculptures of women’

Worship of the family gods - ancestor worship - extending down to salavan’s houshold. Guardian angels of household fortunes. Gret gods of the pantheon protected the state; they were too lofty and too imporant to take care of individuals.
Whoever was in possession of the family gods was considered a ‘real son’ and shared in the inheritence, even stepsons (thus biblical Rachel’s stealing).

Vaudeville performer - people would go house to house and sing songs of ancients stories and myths.
Perhaps this is one of the arts mandrameen so loves.

Jehovah’s famous fight against the monster leviathan. Rejected or not by theologians, this was the popular creation story of the common people. Very similar to babylonian creation myth.
Before heaven and earth had been created, the whole universe was an immense watery chaos. Out of this terrible confusion primitive divine beings came into existence, theough they themselves were as yet so chaotic in appearance that they coudl not even be described. Ages passed, and the gods began to take tangible shape and to act. A group of them decided to bring some sort o f law and order into the chaos. This was was a bold step which arouse sharp antaganism of the more conservative deities who thought the old state of affairs was good enough and should be continued. Especially was their decision resented by tiamat, the mother of chaos, a female deity in the form of a dragon personifying the worst, or best, features of it.
She decided to fight. Out of the chaos which she embodied she created immense demons comprising parts of various animals and possessing horrible powers of destruction. She called together her husband and her newly created army and prepared for the fray. At first the gods were frightened. The task they had undertaken  threatened to be more than they had bargained for, but finally one deity advanced to battle. He gripped his weapons and commanded the four mighty winds to stand by. Tiamat came forward and opened her mouth wide. This gave the god his chance.  Immediately he threw into her mouth the mity winds; they pushed so hard that they bod of the dragon goddess became so swollen she could hardly move. The god there upon finished her with his weapons. Then a question arose: what should he do with the gigantic carcass? It must have been immense in size and in form it must have resembled that of a huge flat vase. The god split the body open. One portion he laid flat and it became the earth. The other half he bent over the earth and it became the heavens. Chaos was dead. The work of establishing order in the universe could now begin. Tiamats husband, a very minor being, had been captured. The gods beheaded him, and from the blood that came out of his body, mixed with the clay of the soil, they created mankind.
Originally this story was given to sumerian Enlil, then taken up by babylonian god Marduk. Then the assyrians changed it, gave credit to Ashur.
Then the story passed to palestine, where hebrews celebrated jehovah as the slayer of the leviathan. 

Pg. 140 - story of man being offered food of life by god, will grant him knowledge and raise him up above mere man a’la Adam. Food of life - eternal life. Water of wisdom - know the unknowable - explains why humans, so like animals, have intelligence.

The hebrew sheol and the babylonian arallu were desolate places where all the dead, whether good or bad, had to go. 

When the original writing material, whativer it may have been, was abandoned and clay substituted, it was soon found that one could make a picture in the clay much more quickly and better by impressing than by scratching. Therefor a stylus was used, perhaps only a straight piece of reed with a triangular end, was used to impress the pictures in the fresh clay. All curved lines had to go! Only short straight lines.
Only four types of pictures, vert, right, bottom right, top right dirctional . And arrow. Thus writing aquired a phonetic value.

Why don’t we change the english spelling? All the different ways of representing the same sounds, and iwth so many unnecessary letters which simply bewilder our children. 
	We refrain from chaing it partly from conservatism, partly from the fear that we should be cutting ourselves off from our patrimony o the english language and literature. The advantages we all see, but we keep on spelling in the same old way.

From the explanations there arose an argument which was very learned, and which paralleled the one in the middle ages as to why, if you put a live fish in a vessel completely full of water, the water does not overflow, but if you put in a dead fish, the water does overflow - an argument went on for a long time until an enterprising soul did a little experimenting and found that the water overflowed in both cases - people having opinions on things, evidence supporting priors, when that evidence is non-sense in the first place.


It is very interesting - and pathetic - to follow through these documents the methods employed by tehiptilla and other rich landlords in gaining control of the land owned by the poor peasants. A local law forbade the peasantes to sell their land. Since time immemorial it had been customary for the people of babylonia and assyria to adopt persons  wholwould take care of them in their old age. Suppose a childless couple found the work on their fields too heavy. They would adopt a young man and stipulate that they would give him all their possessions provided he would give them as long as they lived a certain amount of grain, oil, and the necessary clothes. 
The rich landlords of nuzi immediately seized upon this custom and began to make the poor peasants adopt them as sons, so that they could eitehr share in the inheritance of the real children or get all of it. 
This system was used extensively, so that we find the very same man as the adopted son of three or four hundred peasants. That he was not a lone son we can also learn from the court proceedings.</Text>

            <Title>Climbing</Title>
            <Text>The cloak was snagged as good as if it had been sewn into the rock. Its threads were strong, tight-knit, and had been dry-waxed with a special unguent made from cow hoof, salt-sap, and spit, and Pyetle was as light as men come; there wasn’t a chance the cloak would rip any further. Not before he died of thirst. Or cold. He’d rather fall. Instead he just hung, legs and arms as limp as the rags of his tunic.
He curled and stretched his toes. He couldn’t see them. He twirled his feet.
“Pyetle. You climbing up? We not see.”
“Ayram!” Pyetle shouted.
“Yes?”
“Who are you?”
“What?”
“Who are you?”
“Are you climbing?”
“I’ll not climb until you answer.”
“Is he bargaining?” Hill whispered.
“Just spooked,” Ayram said.  Then he shouted down to Pyetle,  “There isn’t time for whatever the hell you think there’s time for.”
There was a moment of silence. Then Pyetle’s shrill voice came ringing up again.
“Who are you?”
“Climb on out!”
“I asked, ‘Who are you?’ ”
“Who are you?” Ayram asked in return.
“I am Pyetle! Who else could I be?”
“When I walked over here,” Ayram said, “all I saw was Hill shouting into a hole. Now a strange voice is shouting back. Pyetle might have fallen in, but he might have fallen to his death. You could be a demon lurking there in the dark!”
“Do I sound like a demon?”
“Aye, you do! 
Hill shouted down, “It be the way the rocks shape sound!”
“Hill!” Pyetle screamed. “Tell Ayram that I’m Pyetle!”
“We no can see you.”
“Climb on up!” Ayram shouted. “At least get high enough so that we can at least see who you are.”
“I can’t climb!”
“Why not? Do you have misshapen demon limbs?”
“The walls are smooth!”
“What are you talking about? There’s a crack here!” Ayram slapped part of the rock face where a deep crack ran down the side of the hole. “Doesn’t it run all the way down to where you are?”
“It does.”
“How wide is it?”
“About the width of three fingers.”
“Good! Perfect. It tapers down. It shouldn’t be too hard to climb up it.”
“I don’t know how to climb a crack!”
“Just stick your fingers in and pull down until they jam. Use your thumb for support or like a shim to get a tight fit.”
“Or stick your hand in side-ways,” Hill added.
“Yes, you can stick your whole hand in sideways and squeeze down. Get the meat of your palm and your fingers to stick.”
“Alright.”
“Squeeze, brace with your thumb, do what you can to inflate your hand in the crack so it’s nice and jammed.”
Pyetle spun himself round to face the rock. He reached up and stuck his fingers in and pulled down. He expected them to slip right out but they locked in place. He then felt out with his toes for a small cleft or angled face so that he could step and push himself up, but there was nothing but smooth undulations.
“What do I do with my feet?” he asked.
“Just stick them right in the crack. Keep your soles inward and your knees bowed out so that as you step up, your foot will naturally twist into the crack and jam in.”
“That sounds too easy.”
“It won’t be. It will hurt.”
As soon as Pyetle stuck his left foot into the crack he knew that it was going to hurt a lot. Even with a slight jam and twist, the rock threatened to rip his bare skin right open.
“I don’t think this will work!” he shouted up.
“You shouldn’t need to climb far.”
“Alright.”
Pyetle stuck his fingers back in and pulled again. He could already feel the skin starting to split on the sides of his knuckles. He stuck his right foot in the crack above his left. As he stepped up his foot twisted round and jammed in, but he hadn’t placed his hand high enough in the crack. As his body separated from rock face, his fingers started to slip out. He shot his other hand high into the crack to steady himself. Once recovered, he reached up even higher, high as could, and started again.
He did a little more this time to save his fingers. He groped around for a more relaxed fit, a more rounded edge. There was no saving the top of his foot. The bottom was calloused enough but the top of his foot’s skin was as soft and webby as pampered old woman’s.
He bit his lip and pushed up.  
“The crack gets wider!” he shouted.
“Yes. It tapers down.”
“It’s too many fingers!”
“Use a fist, then.”
Pyetle stuck his left fist in and wiggled his thumb around and pulled until it set. Up he went. With his next step he found he could fit his whole leg in the crack, up to his buttocks. He shimmied up like this until the crack got even wider, so wide that he could fit his fore-arm into a horizontal brace.
“Can you see me?” he shouted up.
“We can!”
“Well? How about it?”
Hill waved the torch around, trying make out more of Pyetle than the bald spot on the top of his head.
“You are not a demon,” he said, smirking aside to Ayram.
“How about you, Ayram?” Pyetle asked. 
Ayram stared down and Pyetle looked up. Pyetle can make out his eyes - just an immense figure. Even more sure that this wasn’t a simple human.
“On my word,” Ayram said, “I’ll tell you who I am if you climb up out of there.”
“Damn it!” Pyetle slammed his fist against the rock.
“Come on up, Pyetle.”
Pyetle shook his head and began to mutter to no one but the rock. 
“You losing him,” Hill whispered.
“Alright, Pyetle. Alright, “Ayram said. “You will come up if I tell you?”
Pyetle slapped his forehead against the rock. “Yes,” he said.
“Alright. But I can’t simply tell you.”
Pyetle looked up and asked, “Are you a demon?”
“No. You’ve no word in your language for me.”</Text>

            <Text>In describing signed distance function shaders - This is as close to omniscience as it is possible to be.

It helped that his head, too, was exposed to the chill. His stream of consciousness began to freeze over, and so time itself seemed to congeal. Through his eyelids, every strobing green flash imprinted itself onto his retina, but his viscous state of mind had difficulty separating them, and so his narrative self started to weave intermittent points in time together as if they were actually sequential events. As more and more sensory stimulation slipped past unrecorded, these glimpses of light grew further and further apart. His unconscious mind began to struggle to manufacture coherence, and it started to invent sensations where there were none: a tickling of his fingers and feet, a deep and droning incorporeal hum that grew louder as the green flashed. The effect moved Moto into a trancelike state, though through it all, his existential self, his I-me-mine, did not completely disappear. In fact, there was enough of him left to sense his own impending doom, the stretching of time, the thinness of his life. Starting with the ever-slowing cosmic tick of the universe, he could extrapolate out, and understood that it would eventually stop ticking completely. At that point, time would freeze completely into a kind of reflective prism, crystallizing around whatever his last twinkling thought might be, and that would be death. 
As his mind crept towards this jeweled stasis, its even keel was disturbed by a brief, yearning protestation to stay alert, so that he might revel in the experience of dying for as long as possible, so that his last transcendent moment might be one worthy of eternity - if indeed that was how it worked. 
But he did not die. He just sat there in the blinking darkness for another hour more - an empty husk, not aware enough to understand that he was still alive
Then there was  a rumbling, a fumbling. Then a sudden, disruptive shift in his equilibrium. Moto’s eyelids slid open quickly enough to catch a glimpse of a bright beam of white light as it raked across the interior of the pod, looking just like an errant ray of god’s divine light .

This doesnt make sense
I think it pools

“Let me put in terms you can understand. All matter is made up of what?”
“Atoms.”
“No but… yes. What are Atoms made up of.”
“Particles?”
“And what are particles?”
“I do not know.”
	“They’re excitations of fields. Think of it like this,” she pulls out paper, and holds it up flat to deborah’s eye.
“This is a field”, she said, referring to the paper.
“And this is what it looks like with particles.” then she pushed the two ends of the paper closer together, so that the interior of the paper bent like an accordion into an s-shape.
“The peak is a particle, and the trough is an antiparticle. So, if I flatten it out”, she said as she pulled out the curves so that the paper appeared straight to Deborah,“we have no particles.”
Tea again pushed the paper into an s-shape, and said, “Particles”.
“No particles.” She pulled it flat.
“Something.” The wave shape.
“Nothing.” Flat.
“So,” Deborah began, a little confused but following, “when you ask about ‘nothing’, you’re asking me a physics question?”
“Yes and no. I’m just trying to point out a design principle. Notice how, when I squeeze the paper together, there is both a hump and a valley. A positive and a negative. The very structure of nothingness produces somethingness in pairs.” Again, she squeezed the paper together to demonstrate. “In physics, this hump is a particle and and the valley is an antiparticle. They are created together, and they disappear together.” Again she pulled the paper flat. “So, in a manner of speaking, you can think of nothing as the sum of something.” she said as she slowly pulled the paper flat, the two humps slowly canceling each other out into flatness.
“It seems like it’s only clever wordplay,” Tea continued, “but it isn’t. Everything that exists has a kind of mirror image - an opposite - and when taken together, they equal zero. Take this helicopter for example. The amount of downward force the rotors are generating is exactly equal to the amount of upward momentum. The net energy being added or subtracted from the entire system is zero.”
“That’s easy enough to understand.”
“Yes, but things get much stranger. Though, you aren’t going to understand what any of it has to do with you. For example, if matter and antimatter are supposed to cancel eachother out, and they are both created in equal pairs when we add energy to nothingness, then we should be left with no matter at all when we take the total sum of everything in the universe. But this isn’t what we see. After all, you and I exist.”
“And why won’t I understand what any of this has to do with me?”
“Because from here it gets more… philosophical.”
“Philosophical?”

The events that gave rise to the universe is described by what is known as the standard model. The universe began hot. After about 1/billionth of a second, it cooled down enough for fundamental particles to appear in pairs, of opposite charge. Known as quarks and anti-quarks. After that came leptons and anti-leptons. Like electrons and positrons. These pairs began annihilating eachother. Most quark pairs had annihilated by the time the universe was a few seconds old, with most leptons gone a few seconds later. When the dust settled, a tiny amount of matter, about on particle in a billion, amanaged to survive the annihilation. That tiny amount went on to form the universe we know.

Maybe large stores of anitmatter survived too. Its opposite charge might counter gravity.

“Philosophers are the altar boys of the secular church. They’re kids who dress up to play the game, but really, they’re just there for the scientist’s pleasure.”

We have Michael bay at one end, and Terrence malick at the other. Right in the middle is christopher nolan. If this line is 10 inches long, Chris nolan is right at the 5 inch mark. Me on this like, I’m 7.25 inches. 7 inches, huh? yeah. Not mad.

How would you describe my culture then? 
Inevitibility
To a true American, the word signifies that the someone hasn’t fully considered all the options, or is instead rooted in ideology instead of practicality. We have been trained since birth to think about possibilities instead of inevitabilities, and about creative destruction instead of stagnation. We idolize success.
In all this, nothing is taught about the law of contrast, that a speck of white is only important because it is surrounded by black, that one person winning means a whole lot of people losing, and that success is only sweet because most people fail.
	This uncomfortable truth has always been easily pushed aside.  We are so ready to believe it, because it means if I ever succeed, it means that I am better than other people, on a fundamental level. This is so fundamental to our psyche, that many have come to an understanding, that they aren’t good.

“Speak American”
Security relies on certain assumptions.
If I have a military base, I assume that whomever comes to attack my base has fewer guys with guns than I do... and I generally it will be a cold day in hell before they'll get very far into the base.
And you assume other things... you assume that your security people can tell the difference between someone with security clearance and a birthday clown.
We assume that the people with clearance obtained it legitimately.
We assume that the people that were given security didn't subsequently decide to sell us out for hookers and blow.
Assumptions.
And there are good assumptions... assumptions that really will hold under most circumstances and bad assumptions.
And good security is basically a process of separating out good assumptions from dumb ones. Then recognizing that your dumb assumptions were a convenient fig leaf you put over serious vulnerabilities that you actually don't have a good solution for...
And then you need to actually come up with a GOOD assumption that covers for what were previously laughable assumptions.
If your security is based on interlocking layers of good assumptions... are you unhackable? I don't know... its a question of perfection and perfection is hard in this universe. BUT... really fucking good security? Near perfect? Sure. I mean... you can do &quot;excellent&quot;... excellent is possible.
But that's not to say that even good security should be discounted as crap. Good is often the best security possible because excellent requires time and money and competent management and users that don't have their heads wedged up their asses.


Now will good security keep ze germans out or whatever? Typically yeah. Even good security is a bitch to get through even for a state sponsored hacking team.
What keeps embarrassing people is SHIT security or NO security.
That is what keeps failing. Not &quot;good security&quot;... not &quot;excellent security&quot;... not &quot;perfect security&quot;...
F'ing none at all keeps failing.
So... lets not geek out on the &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;unhackable&quot; claim. And instead lets focus on whether or not the change to the OS makes Windows have &quot;good security&quot;. If it accomplishes so much as that then we're doing well. If they pushed it up a notch and it's EXCELLENT... Then we're doing very very well indeed.
	

1) No, it is not unhackable. Throw a contest with a bounty to easily prove this.
2) 99% of &quot;hacks&quot; work through social engineering nowadays, and these work regardless of how secure your software is.

The trouble with fighting for human freedom is that one spends most of one’s time defending scoundrels. For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed, and oppression must be stopped at the beginning if it is to be stopped at all.

https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity	
Scientists and engineers have learned many ways to move electrons off of atoms. That means that when you add up the electrons and protons, you would wind up with one more proton instead of being balanced.
Since all atoms want to be balanced, the atom that has been &quot;unbalanced&quot; will look for a free electron to fill the place of the missing one. We say that this unbalanced atom has a &quot;positive charge&quot; (+) because it has too many protons.
Since it got kicked off, the free electron moves around waiting for an unbalanced atom to give it a home. The free electron charge is negative, and has no proton to balance it out, so we say that it has a &quot;negative charge&quot; (-).
So what do positive and negative charges have to do with electricity?
Scientists and engineers have found several ways to create large numbers of positive atoms and free negative electrons. Since positive atoms want negative electrons so they can be balanced, they have a strong attraction for the electrons. The electrons also want to be part of a balanced atom, so they have a strong attraction to the positive atoms. So, the positive attracts the negative to balance out.
The more positive atoms or negative electrons you have, the stronger the attraction for the other. Since we have both positive and negative charged groups attracted to each other, we call the total attraction &quot;charge.&quot;
Energy also can be measured in joules. Joules sounds exactly like the word jewels, as in diamonds and emeralds. A thousand joules is equal to a British thermal unit.
	
When electrons move among the atoms of matter, a current of electricity is created. This is what happens in a piece of wire. The electrons are passed from atom to atom, creating an electrical current from one end to other, just like in the picture.
	
Electricity is conducted through some things better than others do. Its resistance measures how well something conducts electricity. Some things hold their electrons very tightly. Electrons do not move through them very well. These things are called insulators. Rubber, plastic, cloth, glass and dry air are good insulators and have very high resistance.
Other materials have some loosely held electrons, which move through them very easily. These are called conductors. Most metals – like copper, aluminum or steel – are good conductors.


not all information is equal, if it is political, you can no longer assume its veracity. football score vs. score on the ground.

THe only difference between men and women and is that women are much more willing to engage in social gamesmanship. They are a purer breed of political animal. Men don’t like conflict, because for men, it leads to physical fighitng. Thats why women have been kept out of the process for so long.The lines of partisanship is directly correlated to the rise of women in politics.


How does the tunneling work? Picture a perfectly circulare  paddle, that can create ripples inward. in the middle of that water, the math breaks down.

You should never have a goal. Goals are for little people. Goals prevent you from adapting, from seeing the big picture, from winning in the way that you can win.

Beksinski’s goal, generally, is to make sure that once humanity spreads out from earth, to make sure that our governments, our nation states, our institutions and establishments, do not follow. 

two guys, one says, “I wan t to ask you a question - sure - Is it ever ok to kill someone - well that is an interesting question - ill give you some time to think about it - no its ok, its something ive thought about a lot acutaully ,i could tell you right now - ok - So, people always start with moral arguments, but you are wasting your time there. What only matters is what the live creature thinks and does and the consequences he has to live with. Guilt, etc. God, what was in this medicene, I feel like ive taken 5 zanax. - there were like 3 or 4 you took there. *his head is rolling back, clearly struggling to maintain consciousness - Anyways, what youve got to ask yourself is, well, once you’ve started asking yourself it becomes difficult to act, because if you are honest with yourself, it becomes difficult to say that you know what the consequences will be. Like I could certainly make a good argument why killing me would be a bad idea. I could grow up to change the entire world for the better. You could be robbing everyone of that. But then again, that is just the creature aspect of myself reacting to the idea of being killed. It doesn’t want to die, so it will argue for, and try to justify my own existence. So basically, you have to satisfy your creature self, thats all that really matters. *then the dude dies from teh poison that the questioner gave hime.

The law is an enclosed world. The idea that law is supremely important, more important than any other subject, that it is absolutely vital to an understanding of the world, all of these sentiments that you often hear uttered, but only by lawyers. It is unique in that respect. There are people who have never studied philosophy, who admire philosophers. There are people who have never studied history that admire historians. Lawyers are a unique breed in that they have a propensity for acting as their own cheerleaders.

natural vs. revealed theology
the two books - nature - the book of god’s works
		   scripture - the book of god’s revealed theology



S_BEKSINSKI

	Gilgamesh, what you seek you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his lot, eternal life they withheld. Let your every day be full of joy. Love the child that holds your hand. Delight in your wife’s embrace, for these alone, are the concerns of humanity.

“To start, we must first ask, “What is natural about humans?” Unlike the bull or tiger, we are weak, however, we are creatures of reason. “What is natural for creatures that are weak, but reasonable?” It is to join together against stronger creatures. This is the natural law of interests. As rational egoists we need to join together, and because of this we are compelled to create - artificially - a functioning social life; an abstraction of natural love and natural hatred. This accord between humans manifests itself grandly in the form of nation states. Established in the twentieth century, these institutions still exist today, because, of course, there is no need for them to consolidate even further.. Outside of the atom bomb, there has been no ‘stronger creature’ to overcome. The nation state is the apex predator. A global institution with teeth is not only undesirable, it is completely unnecessary. Only the discovery of a more superior creature could disturb this equilibrium.”

-Jakub Beksinski, Jurisprudence and International Law (2135)

“The fundamental mechanism of adaptation in any system is the revision and recombination of its building blocks. The cell will reorganize its proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to perform different functions. On a larger scale the corporation will reorganize its divisions, the divisions will reorganize their departments, and the departments will reorganize their employees. In order for an adaptation of this kind to be beneficial, it is absolutely crucial for the complex adaptive system to have some method of acquiring accurate information about its environment. Otherwise the system essentially reverts to natural selection to prune inefficiencies, and this is a terribly inefficient process.
For the individual, narrative is the enemy of accurate perception of one’s environment. Narrative precludes the complete understanding of a problem by idealizing those features of a system which it deems ‘non-essential’. In simpler terms the storyteller says,“Look at this and ignore that.” Storytelling is seduction; its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the storyteller wants you to see. The active consciousness is a kind of storyteller. It can cause one to ignore large amounts of data in favor of creating a quick and neat model of understanding. Human evolution has proven this behavior to be a useful heuristic when one is confronted with certain mammalian problems. However, when confronted with a complex threat this process can be fatal. To avoid this trap, one must approach a problem first through the nervous system, taking in as much uninterpreted data as possible. Only after this is done is it suitable to apply conscious effort. To always be arriving at a more accurate understanding, this process should be repeated until one is forced to act.”

Those who have handled sciences have been either men of experiment or men of dogmas. The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. But the bee takes a middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own. Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy; for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay it up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and digested. Therefore from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never yet been made), much may be hoped.

Bacon's The New Organon and his contribution to empiricism and the scientific revolution.

When it comes to tackling difficult problems, there are - as Francis Bacon put it - three different types of problem solvers. There are spiders, there are ants, and there are bees.
Spiders are those who try to solve complex problems by constructing abstract webs of well-reasoned thought. The problem solving process for them is a principally deductive exercise, in which causes can be deduced from symptoms. Imagine Sherlock Holmes turning his lens onto the human condition, attempting to unravel its mysteries.  An extremely complex problem, the spider correctly assumes, calls for an elegant solution. 
Ants are people who experiment. Unlike the spider, they do not create using substances pulled from themselves, they record what simply and undeniably, is. This is the inductive method, empirical, scientific, only resting on what the evidence can bear. No quarter is given to speculation, idle reasoning, and bullshit. An extremely complex problem, the ant correctly assumes, cannot be reasoned about except through experimentation. 
Bees are the consummate middle. Like ants, they journey out into the real world, experimenting with its matter, mapping its contours, learning its history. They use this practical experience as a foundation to organize, like spiders, elegant structures that help to achieve a desired end. An extremely complex problem, the bee correctly assumes, requires an elegant solution derived through experimentation. 
It takes effort, even training, to be a bee. It is easy to slip into spider-like habits, because every problem, from human suffering to tying your shoes, can be modeled, simplified, abstracted into discrete and configurable components. But there is always the question of implementation. It is easy for the spider to say, “Humans are endowed with certain inalienable rights”, but to actually protect them is another matter. Similarly, it is easy to be an ant, refusing to deal with anything that isn’t tangible in the pursuit of accuracy. It is impossible to be wrong if one deals only with what the facts say, and nothing more. The unfortunate result of this necessarily narrow field of view is that things like human rights simply do not exist. There is only what is real, and this is the law, as crafted by those who power, this is the natural law, any other considerations are dreams. Realpolitik. Being a bee requires the discipline to stick to the facts when they are there, and the courage to explore when they aren’t. 

“speculatists,” with their grandiose plans for the wholesale replacement of a corrupt present with a rational future.1 Burke had nothing but scorn for “those extravagant and presumptuous speculations” that lead revolutionary leaders “to despise all their predecessors, and all their contemporaries.”2 The proper course of action, in his opinion, is to build on the solid basis of the past, and always with due regard to the concrete realities of human experience. 


If humans have the same hardware, but different software, then the act of problem solving reveals the common underlying threads. 

Bacon spider/bee/ant analogy - America, and the international community in general, suffers from an infestation of spiders, who have weaved their webs so intricately so as to accept only other spiders into their affairs. 


Get rid of the fluffy speculation, that common law ‘emanates’ from natural law. From arbitrary guidelines that the practical legislator is somehow supposed to divine the meaning of. 


It is not unreasonable  for one to see the injustices of the law and suppose law is the problem. In the fire of the moment, it can be difficult to abstract the practice and necessity of law from its fallen implementation. The rule of law, from the individual’s perspective, the only palatable way of being. Of course, this conception of natural law’s emanation is just as idealistic as that of the alternative ‘benevolent ruler, in that it requires just, honest, and righteous men and women to write. The great strength of reliance upon natural law its advances, are more permanent and difficult to change. Of course the great weakness is that if it is ever written by the unrighteous, these changes too are difficult to change. The benevolent ruler model is the opposite, in which unrighteous rules can be easily removed, whereas if the ruler is not benevolent, then righteous rules may be cast by the wayside in an instant. Of course, the Realpolitik suggests that this is also true in nations governed by the rule of law, and this may seem so in the short run, but time bears witness to its efficacy. 
	Take for example, the conquer of the New World. A wholly unjust doctrine to be sure, and even so during the time in which it took place. During the 14th century the doctrine of natural was firmly fixed as the north star in the constellation of laws guiding the western medieval world. It was, rightly, even veiwed by Aquinas as that The Christian world in that time, for all the flak it receives for injustice, was the only soverign that recognized the right of pagan countries to exist. The reason for this, is the development of the concept of natural law - first begun by the greeks and romans, and expounded upon by thinkers like the dominican Aquinas, Suarez, and Voltine. These men recognized that the only way to govern justly, in this sinful world, was to separate out the laws of man from the laws of truth, emanating from the naturalness of nature. Even God did not exist, it was argued, these laws still would. And so, there came a general understanding that all men, pagan or not, had certain basic rights that could not be trampled on by any other human, christian or not. This is the lasting contribution, built up over time, of the western world to the community of nations. 
	But there are strategies to help write easily readable, understandable, just, and efficacious law. It is helpful to think of the development of law to the practice of computer science. Legacy code. Ecapsulation. Elegance. Context dependent = bad. examples. Great utility for one bit of code.

The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.
We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society.
Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet.
They govern us by their qualities of natural leadership, their ability to supply needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure. Whatever attitude one chooses toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons-a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty million-who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world.
It is not usually realized how necessary these invisible governors are to the orderly functioning of our group life. In theory, every citizen may vote for whom he pleases. Our Constitution does not envisage political parties as part of the mechanism of government, and its framers seem not to have pictured to themselves the existence in our national politics of anything like the modern political machine. But the American voters soon found that without organization and direction their individual votes, cast, perhaps, for dozens of hundreds of candidates, would produce nothing but confusion. Invisible government, in the shape of rudimentary political parties, arose almost overnight. Ever since then we have agreed, for the sake of simplicity and practicality, that party machines should narrow down the field of choice to two candidates, or at most three or four.
In theory, every citizen makes up his mind on public questions and matters of private conduct. In practice, if all men had to study for themselves the abstruse economic, political, and ethical data involved in every question, they would find it impossible to come to a conclusion without anything. We have voluntarily agreed to let an invisible government sift the data and high-spot the outstanding issue so that our field of choice shall be narrowed to practical proportions. From our leaders and the media they use to reach the public, we accept the evidence and the demarcation of issues bearing upon public question; from some ethical teacher, be it a minister, a favorite essayist, or merely prevailing opinion, we accept a standardized code of social conduct to which we conform most of the time.
In theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on the market. In practice, if every one went around pricing, and chemically tasting before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, economic life would be hopelessly jammed. To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas and objects brought to it attention through propaganda of all kinds. There is consequently a vast and continuous effort going on to capture our minds in the interest of some policy or commodity or idea.
It might be better to have, instead of propaganda and special pleading, committees of wise men who would choose our rulers, dictate our conduct, private and public, and decide upon the best types of clothes for us to wear and the best kinds of food for us to eat. But we have chosen the opposite method, that of open competition. We must find a way to make free competition function with reasonable smoothness. To achieve this society has consented to permit free competition to be organized by leadership and propaganda.

The more formally constructed your game is, the more limited it will be.

It is also anti-idealist. It refuses the idea that in aesthetic experience we perceive “a pure integration of meaning”. His aesthetics is consequently anti-representationalist. There is in the artwork something which Gadamer describes as its resistance to integration, to being reduced to a concept (Palmer 2001 25). He contends that Hegel's definition of the beautiful as the “sensuous appearing of the Idea” presumes that aesthetic experience is able to reach beyond the specific type of appearance to its underlying idea. In this model, aesthetic experience becomes the expectation of a semantic fulfillment. Once the idea behind the appearance is grasped, “the whole of its meaning would have been understood once and for all and thus brought in to our possession so to speak”. The work of art becomes a carrier of meaning, to be abandoned once the lead story has been grasped. But, Gadamer argues, “our understanding of art works is manifestly not of this type. Everyone knows this from his or her own encounters with art, from concerts, visits to museums, and from his or her reading”(Palmer 2001 66). This denial of idealist aesthetics is at the basis of his claim that an artwork is essentially enigmatic.
Gadamer's opposition to aesthetic idealism is supported by the claim that art “cannot be satisfactorily translated in terms of conceptual knowledge” (RB 69). A work does not simply refer to a meaning which is independent of itself. Its meaning is not to be grasped in such a way that that it can be simply transferred to another idiom.

Rudolph Arnheim: The Split and the Structure
From Chaos to Wholeness
In a gestalt, each unit is affected and modified by its relations to other units of the system. Each relation, in turn, is affected by the agent generating it. It is an interaction that operates within every level of the structure, from the whole to its subordinates and between the various levels as well. Given the three- dimensional complexity of such a structure, it can be conceptualized only in approximation, which is what scientists are equipped to do when they describe the functioning of organisms or the nature of sensory perception. The same is true for aestheticians analyzing works of art.

The Sokal affair, also called the Sokal hoax,[1] was a publishing hoax perpetrated by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor and, specifically, to investigate whether &quot;a leading North American journal of cultural studies – whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross – [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions&quot;.[2]
The article, &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot;, was published in the Social Text spring/summer 1996 &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue. It proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct. At that time, the journal did not practice academic peer review and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.[3][4] On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in Lingua Franca that the article was a hoax, identifying it as &quot;a pastiche of left-wing cant, fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense ... structured around the silliest quotations [by postmodernist academics] he could find about mathematics and physics.&quot;[2]
The hoax sparked a debate about the scholarly merit of humanistic commentary about the physical sciences; the influence of postmodern philosophy on social disciplines in general; academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors and readers of Social Text; and whether Social Text had exercised appropriate intellectual rigor.

“Call me Elle.”
Frank was reminded of a friend’s warning about women in Shreveport. Don’t get involved. They’re venus man-traps. Sirens on the rocks of Shreveport. 

I went to a lower tiered school. Think 3rd-4th tier.
 I grinded for five years, billing insane hours for a insurance defense litigation sweat shop. After five years of litigation, I lateraled to a Vault firm, where I've been for the last five years. It's the kind of firm that would not accept the likes me, because of my inferior pedigree. Truth be told, I used my less than stellar credentials as motivation, and managed to lateral into my current firm by impressing one of the partner who was a co-defendant.
Five years later, I love the firm, love the work, fantastic institutional clients, but am spent. I can separate how grateful to the partner who hired me, from the toll it's taking on my personal life and desire to do the things I want to do. So, I'm done and my managing partner understands. The money isn't going to buy back the time I'm spending in the office.
So that's it. I'm selling most of my possessions, picking up a backpack, and headed to South America for a while. Where I'll end up, only time will tell. I'll be back in the States eventually.
Just wanted to bid adieu to my hard working colleagues. Be kind.
Edit. I came back this morning and spent half an hour responding to some of the comments here. And thanks for all of them.
When I was 14, I didn't have money for Sadie Hawkins. (Do kids still have that?) I went on the Pennysaver (another relic), saw an ad to sell flowers on the side of the road, so I signed up. Made $32 that day. That bought our tickets, matching t-shirts and bus passes. While I didn't think of it then, I think about that day often, and how it defines who I am and that no work is beneath me. I share that because things always have a way of working themselves out for me.
With respects the to figurative turning in of the bar card, I know my career as an attorney is over. I trust my instincts and know what makes me happy. I understand the need to have safety outlets, but I know that I'm done insofar as my employment as an attorney.
Thank you for the comments and insights.

One of the happiest J.D.s I have known is a woman who runs a little Monewbakery in Juneau, AK. She used to litigate for a V100 firm, got burned out, moved to a charming coastal town, bakes cupcakes, is happy and content. There is life after law,

As I've stated to some of the others, I think the experience as an attorney varies. I know some lawyers who don't really care about their jobs or work, and they're happy as clams. I, on the other hand, internalize everything, and it makes me miserable.

I wish I could join you. After 6 years in a federal agency, 5 years before law school on Capitol Hill, an LLM in a niche field...I can't find a position outside my miserable government office. I've received no real legal training here. No firm would hire me and I'm from a top 50 school with good grades and a top 20 international LLM university. But $100,000+ of student loans and a family has made a modern day slave out of me. No hope of ever owning a home...no real opportunities for advancement or lateraling. The law is a joke as a profession.

&quot;The maxim is sometimes said to be a fundamental principle of the whole criminal law, but I think that, like many other Latin sentences supposed to form part of the Roman law, the maxim not only looks more instructive than it really is, but suggests fallacies which it does not precisely state.

was an event in the late fifth century BC, related by the Roman historian Livy. It was a period of Roman history (long before there was a Roman Empire) marked by deep political and social conflict between the patrician and plebeian orders. This disunity naturally impaired the fledgling state’s ability to present a united face to actual or potential enemies abroad. But an incident in 438 or 437 BC had the effect of instantly uniting the Roman people against the neighboring state of Veii. In that year, the ruler of Veii, Lars Tolumnius, ordered the murder of four envoys sent to him from Rome. This deed was described by Livy not merely as an act of “unspeakable brutality” but also as an egregious violation of “the law of nations (ius gentium).”1 The Roman people—plebeian and patrician alike—were as one in their outrage, and war was inevitable. The result was a conflict of some twelve years’ duration, eventuating in a Roman victory


[Alexander] was, at least ostensibly, avenging the Persian invasion of Greece of a century and a half earlier.2 There was no shortage of skepticism as to the validity of this justification. But the crucial point is that it was generally seen to be necessary for even the greatest of conquerors to have justice on their side, as well as the god of battles.

Some biologists have suggested a genetic explanation for altruistic behavior toward relatives.14 Claims have even been made of a specific biochemical basis for parochial altruism: a neuropeptide called oxytocin, which is produced in the human brain and operates as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone. This “love hormone” (as it has sometimes been dubbed) is thought to have originally been associated with mother-infant bonding and later with various other prosocial features such as trust and empathy15—but only within a limited social range. Oxytocin, it has been asserted, also “contributes to the development of intergroup bias and preferential treatment of in-group over out-group members.” It thereby “paves the way

A speaker in one of Plato’s dialogues referred to a general belief that states “are all engaged in a never-ending lifelong war against all other states.” As a result, “what most men call ‘peace’ is really only a fiction, and in cold fact all states are by nature fighting an undeclared war against every other state.”76

The most concrete manifestations of this unity were the periodic intercity gatherings in the form of the great athletic games, of which the most famous, in honor of Zeus, took place at Olympus. As in China, movement of individuals between

Thucydides, in his history of the epic Peloponnesian War (of 431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, related a famous instance in which considerations of law or justice played no part. This occurred in 416/15 BC, when Athens refused to respect the wishes of the inhabitants of the island of Melos, originally a Spartan colony, to remain neutral. The pleas of the Melians were brushed aside by the Athenian military commanders, who asserted the existence of “a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can.” They warned that following “the path of justice and honor” was likely to prejudice the higher goals of self-interest and security.

But in all events, a priesthood of persons known as fetials was established in Rome at an early period, and a ritual introduced for inaugurating war. Briefly, it involved the sending of an envoy from Rome to the frontier of the would-be enemy state, where redress of some injury would be publicly demanded according to “religion and justice.” If satisfaction was refused (as was expected), the envoy would return to Rome to seek the opinions of the fetials as to whether war should be declared. If the fetials expressly approved of the waging of “just and righteous war” over the issue in question—and it would appear that they always did—then one of their number would himself go to the enemy’s frontier, bearing a spear. He would make a formal announcement of the war—including the just cause that had given rise to it—and then hurl the spear into the enemy’s territory, thereby officially inaugurating the hostilities. Livy records the first use of this procedure as taking place around 625 BC, against the neighboring city of Latium.103 It must not be thought that this fetial procedure went

millennia preceding the dawn of history”11—with the result that the human creature is, by nature, “an intensely tribal animal”12 with a “hardwired propensity to downgrade other-group members.”13

Modern scientists have given the label “parochial altruism” to this phenomenon of being altruistic and cooperative within small groups, while simultaneously hostile to outsiders.9 Konrad Lorenz, the noted Austrian ethologist, suggested that this moral dualism represents two sides of the same biological coin. He contended that animals which are noted for their mutual loyalty within their small groups are especially aggressive toward outsiders. “The proverbially most aggressive of all animals,” he maintained, “Dante’s bestia senza pace [i.e., the wolf] is the most faithful of friends.”10 In a similar vein, the evolutionary biologist Edward O. Wilson has hypothesized that parochial altruism is an innate biological feature of Homo sapiens. “Our instincts,” he suggests, “still desire the tiny, united band-networks that prevailed during the hundreds of


Natural law, to them, was essentially what it had been to Aristotle: a set of norms that were applicable worldwide and not simply to this society or that one. The basic idea was aptly summed up by Cicero, in words attributed to a speaker in a dialogue. Natural law (ius naturale) was described as “right reason in harmony with nature”—as a body of law that was “spread through the whole human community, unchanging and eternal.”
What Ulpian did not explain was whether the ius gentium should be seen as a subcategory of natural law—that is, as that portion of natural law which was applicable uniquely to humans—or whether its content was altogether separate from that of natural law. In all events, though, he was emphatic that the two kinds of law were not identical. Ulpian helpfully provided some illustrative examples. Into the category of natural law, he placed marriage, along with the procreation and rearing of children. Into the category of ius gentium, he placed slavery—carefully noting that, according to natural law, all persons are born free.139 From Hermogenian, a legal writer of the third

The Chinese conception of world order was essentially that of a world state with a single hegemon—the Chinese emperor. The Roman vision was very different. In place of a benevolent universal ruler, it advanced the more abstract, but ultimately more powerful, idea of an impersonal and universal rule of law. Moreover, the Roman legacy of universal law, in both of its incarnations—natural law and the ius gentium—was sharply distinguished from Rome’s own civil (or national) law. This divergence between Chinese and Roman ways proved decisive. It would, eventually, determine that international law would be a product not of China but of Europe. Medieval Europe, however, would be no mere passive recipient of its classical heritage. It would make important innovations of its own.

In a nutshell, it was the idea that there is a body of law above and beyond that of state governments. More than that, though, it was the notion that this law actually constrains governments themselves, just as it constrains ordinary people. This law was not, however, always self-evident, and it was never self-executing. To some modest extent, these shortcomings could be dealt with by the Catholic Church. It possessed highly learned men who could expound the content of the law, and it had various spiritual weapons that it could wield against evildoers in high places. Medieval Europe accordingly had extensive experience in the defining and enforcing of universal standards against governments.

That the Roman emperor—who became officially “Holy” in 1157—was the foremost ruler in Western Europe was not doubted. But the claims that were advanced on his behalf were truly startling: of universal dominion. It was canon lawyers who first asserted that the Holy Roman emperor was the lord of the entire world (dominus mundi) and that, as such, he possessed a residual de jure sovereignty over the entire world. Rulers of the various kingdoms, on this thesis, possessed merely de facto power, which they had somehow wrested from the grasp of the universal monarch. A prominent champion of this theory was the eminent Italian Bartolus of Sassoferrato, one of the most famous and learned lawyers of the Middle Ages.

Between natural law and the Christian religion, there was a certain wariness. To contend that natural law was an adjunct of the Christian faith is very wide of the mark. Natural-law thought long preceded the advent of Christianity and was, in its inception, wholly a product of classical (i.e., Greek and Roman) civilization. It is impossible to overstate the importance of this point. Natural law was not religious either in content or origin, nor did the Christian faith have any privileged status within it. It was a law for the entire world at large, transcending the enormous diversity of the various human societies. At the same time, it is true that only Western European civilization devised such a body of thought. Indeed, natural law deserves to rank highly among the most distinctive features of Western civilization. What should be carefully appreciated, though, is that, even if the origin of natural-law thought was thoroughly and distinctively Western, the content of the law was held to be applicable worldwide. Natural law, in short, was a radically cosmopolitan, universalist corpus of thought. In this important respect, European civilization was sharply different from other societies. China had no such conception of natural law in the sense of a body of law applicable equally to all societies. The Chinese view was that China’s own society was innately superior to all others, and hence that other societies were to be evaluated according to how nearly they conformed to Chinese ways. It will be seen that much the same ethos prevailed in the Islamic world, where the one body of law was held to govern the true believers, with infidels left to their own devices—and with no “master law” governing both.

 It will be recalled that, to Aristotle, sociability was a “natural impulse” of humans—hardwired into the human biogram. It was automatically and inescapably part of the human condition.31 Under the rationalist scheme, however, that confidence was in danger of being lost. Aquinas salvaged it as best he could by simply positing that the rules of natural law are compatible with “our natural inclinations”—and that among these is “a natural inclination … to live in society” and “to avoid giving offence to those among whom one has to live.”32 Natural-law thought, therefore, even in its newer rationalist form, managed to retain the traditional commitment to the principle of the natural sociability of humankind. The world is, in this picture, fundamentally harmonious and orderly rather than chaotic and violent.

The first theory, which we will call the “dualist” approach, held the two bodies of law to be more or less wholly distinct. The second school of thought, to be labeled the “substitution” theory, held the ius gentium to be a kind of second-rate substitute for natural law. Finally, the “emanationist” school (as it is being termed) held the two to be very closely connected, to the point that the ius gentium was actually a logical derivation from natural law. Of the three schools of thought concerning the relationship between natural law and the ius gentium, the dualistic one posited the sharpest distinction. It held that the two bodies of law differed from one another in two key respects. The first was that the ius gentium was a human creation, while natural law was not. The second key difference—and the one justifying the label—was that the two bodies of law applied to different subject areas or spheres of activity. Of the three theories, this one bore the clearest mark of the Roman law origin of the ius gentium. In fact, it was basically
 Things covered by natural law pertain largely to the conduct of individual persons, such as marriage, the bringing up of families, and the fending off of assaults. Things falling into the ambit of the ius gentium, in contrast, are activities of states, including various aspects of war making and peacemaking.
clear enough. The ius gentium is a man-made law, but only in the very restricted sense that it is humans, rather than animals, who are able to employ reason and thereby to discover what natural law requires in a variety of specific cases. The effect, then, is that natural law comprises the broad general principles, and the ius gentium the conclusions which logically flow from them. Employing a geometric analogy, we would say that natural law corresponds to the axioms, and the ius gentium to the theorems—with the two being, of course, intimately connected by an unbreakable chain of hypothetico-deductive reasoning.

Nevertheless, broad agreement evolved on a fivefold schema of just-war doctrine, first set out in the early thirteenth century by Raymond of Peñaforte, a Spanish Dominican who taught canon law at the University of Bologna.46 The five elements—all five which had to be satisfied—may be identified briefly (in no special order). One element was auctoritas. This meant that war could be waged justly only by a sovereign or by a subject at the command of a sovereign. It could not be done by subjects on their own initiative. A second element was personae. This meant that certain persons were prohibited from participation in war, no matter how clearly just the cause was. Most importantly, this meant that clerics were barred from belligerent activity.47 Third was the requirement of res. This word, meaning simply “thing” in Latin, signified that the war had to have a defined goal or purpose—that the “thing” being fought over must be precisely identified. The clear implication was that, once this defined goal was attained, the war must stop. This principle, then, had the function of preventing a war from dragging on or degenerating into a conflict driven simply by the mutual hatred of the parties for one another. A fourth element of the schema—and in some ways at the very heart of the just-war idea—was the requirement of iusta causa. This meant literally a “just cause.” It should be noted that it meant a just cause in a strictly objective sense. In the dispute over the res, the just side is the one with the stronger legal case. It is not sufficient to fight in good faith, in the sincere belief that the law is on one’s side. The law must actually be on one’s side, or the war is unjust. In legal terminology, it would be said that there is strict liability on this point, meaning simply that no allowance is made for subjective considerations such as good faith.
The fifth and final element of the schema was animus. This referred to the subjective mental state of the combatant, though not to his opinion about the justice of his cause. Instead, it was a requirement that a fighter in a just war must do battle without personal animosity toward his foe. His battle must be against wrongdoing as such, and not against the wrongdoers as individuals. Here is the reflection, in just-war theory, of the Christian command to love one’s enemies. A just war should be seen as an enterprise in correction and instruction, and not in vengeance or bloodlust. War waged for greed or glory or for love of violence is unjust, even if the requisite iusta causa is present.

This was in marked contrast to the Christian idea of government as being, at best, a necessary evil—an instrument for suppressing or policing the basic depravity of the human character. Another Aristotelian political philosophy, with its key notion that states or governments are natural phenomena—and also are vehicles for the attainment of the fulfilling life.

Marsilius of Padua. Neither a lawyer nor a theologian, his professional training was in medicine. He supported Louis of Bavaria in his unsuccessful claim to the Holy Roman emperorship. More memorably, he wrote a major work of political theory, Defensor pacis (The Defender of Peace), in 1324.More than any other medieval writer, Marsilius dispensed with the idea of natural law. He did not reject the concept in principle, but he recognized it only as “the science or doctrine of right” and not as actual law. Law in the proper sense, he insisted, is “a command coercive through punishment or reward … in the present world.”71 The fundamental source of law, accordingly, is not reason but the will of the party promulgating it. Moreover, an indispensable sign of law is the omnipresent exposure to a sanction or punishment for its violation—just what natural law lacked. This is the clearest expression in the medieval era of what would later be termed the positivist conception of the law.

In all events, Valverde’s accounts of his experiences made a great impression on his hosts, and on one of them in particular. This was a monk named Francisco de Vitoria, who up until then had taken little or no interest in New World affairs.1 He was a theologian, chiefly distinguished as a leading figure in the sixteenth-century revival of the philosophy of that earlier Dominican, Thomas Aquinas. Vitoria hailed from a prominent family in Burgos. He studied in Paris in the early years of the sixteenth century, especially the works of Aquinas, and then returned to Spain to teach theology, first at the College of San Gregorio in Valladolid. He then moved to the University of Salamanca, where he held the prime chair in theology and expounded the works of Aquinas. He had connections in prominent humanist circles, being a personal friend of the noted Spanish humanist Luis de Vives and a defender of the famous scholar and polemicist Erasmus of Rotterdam from attacks by conservatives.

Vitoria was very impressed by the stories related by Valverde—though not in the manner intended. He was shocked by what he heard, and the more that he learned about the conduct of the Spanish in the New World, the more horrified he became. Later in 1534, he wrote in a private letter that “no business shocks me or embarrasses me more than the corrupt profits and affairs of the Indies. Their very mention freezes the blood in my veins.”2 In 1539, he went public with his concerns, delivering a memorable set of lectures, known as a “relection,” entitled De Indis (On the American Indians). In these, he discussed various issues largely from the standpoint of natural law and just-war doctrine. Vitoria’s conclusions, in some ways, were not so radical. He did accept that, in principle, the Spanish might have had some just cause for war against the Indians. But he doubted whether that amounted to a right of outright conquest and annexation of the Indian realms.

However impressive the Islamic conquests of the seventh and eighth Centuries, they fell far short of encompassing the entire world. It has been observed that, in the case of Christian Europe, an alternative universalist vision was offered by natural-law doctrine. On this point, the Islamic world offered a very striking contrast. Natural law was one notable element of the Greek and Roman classical heritage that did not have a great impact on Muslim thought.4 Where the natural-law tradition insisted on an ultimate and fundamental unity of the entire human race, the Islamic faith held there to be a deep moral chasm between believers and infidels. In order to be truly moral, in Muslim eyes, it was necessary to be a Muslim and, by extension, to know and live by the Muslim law, the sharia.5 It is true that the Muslim faith did not countenance active mistreatment of infidels merely on the basis of nonbelief. On the contrary, “people of the Book” (meaning Jews and Christians plus, in practice, Zoroastrians) were to be tolerated. But this was a toleration liberally flavored by condescension. Infidels were regarded as moral inferiors and were subject to various disabilities, such as special taxation.

The Aristotelian view, which was especially influential in the Dominican Order of monks (which included Aquinas), was fundamentally hostile to ideas of universal dominion and correspondingly supportive of ideas of mutual independence of states—with implications of non intervention by states in the affairs of one another.67 Aristotelianism, in short, was a philosophy of pluralism that directly challenged the universalist theses of empire and papacy. An expression of this new Aristotelian outlook can be found in the writing of a Dominican named John of Paris (Jean Quidort), who wrote in the late thirteenth century, in the generation after Aquinas. John was an avowed pluralist, maintaining that, because of the complexity of political life and secular power, it is not possible for universalism to reign in that sphere of life, as it can (and should) in the religious one. Different peoples have different modes of life, and there must therefore be different governments to accommodate them. Consequently, it is both necessary and desirable that there be a multiplicity of kingdoms.68 “There can be many different ways of living,” asserted John, “and different kinds of state conforming to differences in climate, language, and the conditions of men, with what is suitable for one nation not so for another.” He concluded, expressly invoking the authority of Aristotle, that “development of individual states and kingdoms is natural, [while] that of an empire or [universal] monarchy is not.”69

The Islamic ideal was that the Muslim world should comprise a single community of believers, united in a single polity and governed by sharia, the Islamic religious law. Within that world, there could be, in principle, no such thing as international law. Relations with the infidel world were, however, a different matter. The Quran, the sacred book of the Islamic faith, did not itself offer much guidance. But a body of law known as siyar gradually grew up to deal with such issues. (Siyar is the plural of the Arabic word sirah, which simply means conduct or behavior.)6 We must beware of thinking of the Islamic siyar in terms of our modern conception of international law because it was seen as a law exclusively for Muslims, not for infidels. It was a body of rules that instructed Muslim rulers on how they were to behave toward non believers. In modern parlance, it would be characterized as the Muslim law of foreign relations, rather than as international law per se.7

Since siyar was seen as part of Islamic law, it followed that it must, in principle at least, flow from the same sources as Muslim law generally. In practice, however, that was not really the case, since the traditional sources of Islamic law had too little to offer in the way of substantive rules of conduct. Siyar was therefore, to a large extent, separate from other branches of Muslim law, being derived largely from custom and from reason rather than from the prescriptions of the Quran or practices of the Prophet Muhammad (which were, and still are, the two

In an important sense, then, all Muslim wars against infidel powers—offensive and defensive alike—were regarded as, per se, just, provided that an invitation to convert was given prior to the launching of hostilities.

For all of these activities, the hardiness of the pioneer and the bravado of the warrior were greatly in demand. So too, however, were the skills of a more subtle and unobtrusive group of persons: lawyers. One of the challenges facing medieval lawyers was to determine the legal bases for these various external adventures. This was especially problematic for two of the four regions of expansion: the Holy Land and northeastern Europe. An important part of the lawyers’ task was to decide what kind of entitlement to govern was possessed by the preexisting rulers—who in all cases were non-Christians. In dealing with these vital issues, natural-law doctrine was summoned to assist.

Since natural law applied to all members of the human race (and even to the entire animal kingdom, in Ulpian’s version), there was no doubt that non-Christians were fully entitled to be owners of private property. More problematic was whether they had a right to exercise rulership, particularly over Christian subjects. There was a powerful strain of thought in Western Europe to the effect that pagans could not possess title to lands. This was the opinion of Hostiensis (also known as Henry of Segusio), who taught canon law at the University of Paris during the thirteenth century. In 1253, he contended that, “with the advent of Christ all offices and princely ranks … have with just cause been withdrawn from all heathen and transferred to Christians.”28 Giles of Rome, who was archbishop of Bourges and a follower of Thomas Aquinas, insisted, in this same vein, that a person cannot be “the lord of anything or … possess anything with justice unless he is also spiritually regenerated through the Church.”29 Aquinas himself held a somewhat more moderate stance: that, if sovereignty by an infidel ruler over Christians was “an established fact,” then it could be allowed to continue—but that it was subject to revocation by the church at any time. The reason, he explained, was that “infidels by their infidelity deserve to forfeit power over the faithful.”30

But this position did not, in the event, win official favor. The decisive contribution to the debate was made in 1243 by Pope Innocent IV (Frederick II’s nemesis).31 Invoking natural law, he pronounced that “[d]ominions, possessions and jurisdictions are lawful and blameless among the infidels, for these were created not only for the faithful, but for all rational creatures.”32 Pagan princes even had a lawful right to rule over territories that had been conquered from prior Christian rulers—with the notable exception (as will be seen) of the Holy Land in the Middle East. This natural-law right to political dominion was likened, in its universality, to sunshine, which warmed persons of all faiths and cultures alike. For these views, there could be a case for crowning Innocent IV with the contested title of father of international law.33

The logical implication of Innocent’s position was immediately apparent. In order for wars against pagans and infidels to be lawful, they would have to be brought within the framework of general just-war doctrine, or else some kind of alternative justification outside that framework would have to be devised. That posed something of a challenge. But there was no shortage of lawyers prepared to meet it. Justifications for Crusading If traditional just-war theory was to be employed to justify crusading, then a persuasive just cause (iusta causa) would have to be identified. One possible theory was repressive rule by the Saracens (in the form of persecution of Christians), which could be argued to justify forfeiture of their right to rule. This was put forward, admittedly not in very dispassionate legal terms, at the outset of the crusading movement to the Holy Land. The famous sermon by Pope Urban II at Clermont in 1095, in one of the versions in which it has been reported (supposedly firsthand), contained an extensive catalogue of atrocities attributed to the Muslims. These included the devastation of the Holy Land with “pillage, fire, and the sword,” the infliction of “cruel tortures” onto Christians, the destruction of churches, and the ruining of altars with “filth and defilement.”34

In the longer term, however, allegations of misconduct by infidel rulers lost their persuasiveness, and resort was had to two other theories that were devised outside the framework of general just-war theory. One of them, known as recuperatio (“recovery”), was applied to crusading in the Holy Land. The other, known as dilatatio (“expansion” or “widening,” cognate with the English word “dilate”), applied to the northeastern European crusading theater. The recuperatio theory was the more widely accepted of the two, since it had the support of Innocent IV himself. It held that the Holy Land must be seen as something of a special case. It was stated to be, uniquely, a res sancta (“sacred thing”) belonging, in permanent right, to the whole of Christendom. That meant that any infidel rulership over it could never be regarded as legitimate. Consequently, any Christian prince was entitled to reconquer it on behalf of the Christian community generally.35 Among the writers who supported this doctrine were John of Legnano and Bonet.36

The dilatatio theory was more controversial. It was essentially a Christian version of the Muslim thesis, identified earlier, that the conquest of foreign lands was justifiable as a means to the effective promotion of the true faith. Conquest of a non-Christian land could be authorized (the theory went) on the condition that the conquerors convert their new subjects to the Catholic faith after gaining control. The distinctive feature of this doctrine was the absence of any requirement of prior wrongdoing on the part of the infidel rulers. It should also be noted that, as in Islamic belief, the actual conversion of the population was still required to be voluntary, so that the dilatatio principle did not amount, strictly speaking, to forcible conversion. But it justified the employment of force as

an ancillary—and prior—aid to conversion. The dilatatio theory was not invoked in the original proclamation of the northeastern crusade by Pope Eugenius III in 1147. It first emerged in the context of European occupation of the Canary Islands in the fourteenth century. In 1344, Pope Clement VI made a grant of the islands to a certain Luis de La Cerda, a Spanish native who had transferred his allegiance to France. La Cerda’s grant included the enviable title of “Prince of the Fortunate Isles.”37 He was thereby authorized to conquer and rule the islands but was also instructed to employ his powers to promote conversion of the native population to Christianity.38 The following year, Clement VI conferred the status of crusade onto La Cerda’s plans for conquest. As it happened, La Cerda never embarked on the conquest of his felicitous principality. But the concept of dilatatio

the fact that nonadherence to the Christian religion was simply not, per se, a violation of natural law. Consequently, non-Christians could not be deprived of their natural-law rights on the ground of their status as nonbelievers.

Three years later, in 1455, Nicholas V followed this up with another bull, Romanus Pontifex (“Roman Priest”).62 This granted to Portugal “the right of conquest” of a somewhat vaguely defined portion of Africa extending through “all Guinea and beyond toward that southern shore.” The king of Portugal was given the right “to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ wheresoever placed … and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery.” He was also authorized to legislate and to levy taxes in the area. Trade with Saracens was permitted except in materials useful for war. Penalties for infringement of this grant were specified: excommunication for individuals, interdict for communities. The following year, Pope Callixtus III, in a bull entitled Inter Caetera (“Among Other [Works]”), reaffirmed Nicholas V’s grant and supplemented it by giving sole ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the area to the Order of Jesus Christ (a military order, of which Prince Henry was governor).63

The papal-grant theory received strong support at a junta held at the Dominican monastery of San Pablo in Valladolid in 1513. The occasion was the dispatching of an expedition to Panama, under the command of Pedro Arias de Ávila (often known as Pedrarias Dávila), to relieve Balboa of his command. King Ferdinand of Spain ordered its departure to be delayed, pending a consideration of the question of just wars against the natives by a committee of theologians. Two of the more noteworthy participants at this session were Matías de Paz and Juan López de Palacios Rubios. Paz was a Dominican friar and professor of theology at the University of Salamanca. Palacios Rubios was a distinguished lawyer and member of the Council of Castile. Paz set out this thesis in an exposition entitled De Domino Regum Hispaniae super Indios (On the Dominion of the Spanish King over the Indies). This was noteworthy in relying on the papal grants as the sole basis of legal title of the Spanish monarchs.76 The views of Palacios Rubios were expounded in a work entitled De Insulis Oceanus (On the Islands of the Ocean Sea). He contended that, even granting the position of Innocent IV that pagan princes possessed lawful sovereignty, that sovereignty could be revoked from them by the pope and transferred to other rulers (i.e., the Spanish crown).77 Neither of these

Palacios Rubios did not shrink from the full logical consequences of his thesis. It meant that the Spanish crown had sovereignty over the New World territories even prior to the conquests on the ground. The task of the Spanish in the New World was therefore to inform the natives that they now had a new sovereign in the hope that they would quietly accept the new state of affairs. If they proved uncooperative on this point, then they could be lawfully subdued by force—as rebels against their lawful sovereign, not as subjects of an independent foreign prince.

To facilitate this process of taking control of territories already granted, Palacios Rubios outlined a procedure that became known as the requerimiento. It appears to have been modeled on prior Islamic practices, which the Spanish became aware of during their reconquista of the Iberian peninsula.78 In essence, the “requirement” was a summons or ultimatum that was read out to the population of the area that the Spanish were intending to conquer. It informed the people that the Spanish were now their lawful sovereigns and called upon them to accept this state of affairs. As such, it has been derided by one modern historian as “surely the crassest example of legalism in modern European history”79 and by another, scarcely more gently, as “a strange blend of ritual, cynicism, legal fiction, and perverse idealism.”80 The text of the requerimiento began with a (necessarily brief) recitation of the history of the world. This included the key information that the pope had been made “lord and superior to all the men in the world” by God and that he had allocated the lands of the Indians to the monarchs of Castile. The hearers were invited to inspect the documents proving this, if they so wished. They were then called upon to “acknowledge the Church as the ruler and superior of the whole world” and the Spanish monarchs as their “lords and kings” and to permit Christian clerics to preach the faith. They were expressly assured that they would not be compelled to convert to Christianity against their own wishes. But they were required to acknowledge their political subjection to their new sovereign. If they refused (the Indians were told), the Spanish would “forcefully enter into your country and … make war against you … and … subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church” and of the Spanish monarchs. Slavery and confiscation of property would follow.81 A notary was to be present to record in writing that the requerimiento had been duly issued.

The first recorded employment of the requerimiento in the field was in 1514 on the Caribbean coast of what is now Colombia. It appears to have been taken fairly lightheartedly by the Spaniards on that occasion, with stories of its being read out to trees and empty huts or intoned from the decks of ships as they approached Indian territories. But there was no significant contemporary opposition to it.82 It was dutifully employed by Hernán Cortés in his famous conquest of Mexico in 1519–22.83 It may have been read out to the Incans in 1532 in Cajamarca, by Pizarro’s chaplain Valverde—who was later to sojourn at San Esteban—although there was doubt on the point.84 The requerimiento continued to be employed until the 1540s. Its last use appears to have been in a campaign against Chichimec Indians in Mexico in 1542. It was read out on that occasion by a friar who stood prudently out of arrowshot range of the Indians—but probably beyond the range of audibility, too.85

From a legal standpoint, the requerimiento was far from airtight. To be effective, it would have to be heard and understood by the native populations. Making the requerimiento audible over a significant distance would have presented a challenge. Comprehension of it would have posed an even greater difficulty, since there is no evidence of the requerimiento’s ever having been translated into any of the native American languages. Unless a translator was ready to hand on the Indian side, the requerimiento could only have been so much incomprehensible gibberish.86 In recognition of this problem, a Spanish ordinance of 1526, promulgated by the Council of the Indies (the governing body for the Spanish colonies in the New World), required its proclamation in the native languages by interpreters.87

One of the doubters was a young scholar named Domingo de Soto, who was working as a teaching assistant to Vitoria at the University of Salamanca—and who would later be his successor in the theology chair there. In a section of his relection De Dominio (On Dominion), in 1534–35, he held that the popes had no power to confer sovereign rights onto the Spanish and Portuguese monarchs.88 Soto’s master, Vitoria, voiced the same conclusion in his De Indis relection of 1539. The pope, he argued, was not the lord of the whole world. He could confer no sovereign powers onto kings and princes “because no one can give what he does not have.”89 He could therefore allocate spheres of missionary activity to Spain and Portugal but could not grant sovereignty.90

Despite these misgivings, the Spanish and Portuguese governments, together with their legal servants, continued throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to assert that the papal grants did confer actual sovereignty onto their recipients. The most prominent advocate of this thesis—who has been described as “the chief jurist of the [Spanish] empire”—was the Spanish cleric Juan de Solórzano y Pereira.91 A native of Madrid, he spent twelve years at the University of Salamanca—that veritable hub of New World studies—and then became a professor immediately upon graduation. But the major part of his career was spent in royal service, which included an eighteen-year stint as a judge in the audiencia of Lima (in 1609–27). Upon his return to Spain, he served on the Council of the Indies. His massive study of colonial law, De Indiarum Jure (The Law of the Indies), written in 1629–39, served as the de facto official statement of the Spanish government position on colonial issues. In this work, he insisted firmly on the validity of the papal donation as the basis of Spain’s title.92

An alternative basis of title to the New World territories was acquisition by means of a just war. The Spanish government began to incline in this direction as it reduced its reliance on the requerimiento. A decisive step was the promulgation of a set of ordinances in 1526. These stipulated that all licensed expeditions of conquest must be accompanied by two clerics, and that their prior written consent was a prerequisite to the employment of armed force. If war was waged contrary to this policy, then the expedition contract was to be revoked.93 Remarkably, the constraints imposed by the Spanish government sometimes did have effects on the actual conduct of the conquerors. When the audiencia of Guatemala insisted on adherence to these laws, the would-be conquistador Juan Pérez de Cabrera abandoned his conquest campaign rather than submit.94

First was the obvious problem of determining whether the criteria for just wars were actually met in the cases at hand—that is, whether there really was a iusta causa of the kind required. Second was the question of whether even a just war could entail a right of outright conquest. The weakness of the Spanish case on both of these counts was exposed by Vitoria in his two famous relections of 1539. Vitoria devoted the bulk of his attention to the question of iusta causa. A thorough analysis of this issue was his most distinctive contribution to the debates over the Americas. He began by endorsing the standard canon-law position (going back to Innocent IV) that, prior to the Spaniards’ arrival, the Indians possessed lawful dominion over their lands.95 He then carefully considered a list of seven possible justifications for war against the Indians, finding all of them unpersuasive after close argument. Among these “unjust titles” (as he called them) were the punishment of violations of natural law, the claiming of title by right of discovery, and purported grants of sovereignty by an emperor or pope.96 These were regarded as altogether invalid in principle as justifications for war.

Without mentioning the requerimiento explicitly, Vitoria included among his unjust titles a failure on the natives’ part to convert to Christianity upon hearing “a simple announcement” of the faith. Only if the Indians refused to convert in the face of “miraculous signs or other reasons for belief” could compulsion be used—that is, if they positively repudiated the Christian faith rather than merely passively declined to join it. Vitoria added darkly that he had received no information of any such signs. “On the contrary, I hear only of provocations, savage crimes, and multitudes of unholy acts.”97 Vitoria then proceeded to identify eight bases on which, at least in principle, conquest of the Indians could be justified. These included possible violations by the Indians of various rights of the Spanish, such as a right of “natural partnership and communication.” War could also be justified for the purpose of spreading information about the Christian faith, protecting converts, and defending innocent persons against tyrannical rulers. Mental incapacity on the part of foreign peoples could also justify their conquest.98 Vitoria carefully held back, however, from pronouncing on whether any of these justifications had actually been present at the time of the conquests. The nearest that he came was in his endorsement of the lawfulness of assisting allies who were fighting a just war. He cautiously noted that “[t]his is what is said to have happened” during Cortés’s campaign in Mexico, when the Spanish allied themselves with an Indian state that was fighting against the Aztecs.99

There's so much! A lot of the craziest stuff is in the fossil fuel related bills. For example, I've seen multiple bills that make people fly to Washington D.C. to challenge natural gas fracking and fossil fuel pipelines in court and I've seen lots of automatic approvals of permits. There was also a truly scandalous bill that allows US taxpayer bailouts of foreign and domestic banks that trade the riskiest derivatives (the kind that literally crashed the world's economy in 2008). That bill was quietly attached by Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas to the 2015 funding law - which President Obama had to sign to prevent another full government shutdown - and is now law. That is still one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life.

It has been observed that there was significant support for the thesis that the papal awards of the fifteenth century had merely been allocations of spheres of missionary activity and not grants of sovereignty over territory. That did not rule out the possibility, however, that the one might lead to the other. Moreover, there was a readily available legal doctrine tailor-made to accomplish just that intellectual jump: the principle of dilatatio, which was now applied to the New World rather than to northeastern Europe. In the reopened debate over dilatatio, the doctrine was justified on the basis of a more fundamental general principle of law: that, if jurisdiction is granted or a duty imposed, then the party affected must be understood to possess everything necessary to exercise the jurisdiction or perform the duty.113 On this thesis, the Spanish rulers could be entitled to acquire sovereignty over the Indian kingdoms as an adjunct to, or instrument of, the conversion process. This argument is interesting because it effectively conceded that the pope did not directly grant sovereignty to Spain. Instead, he granted the right to acquire sovereignty by means of forcible self-help, if that was necessary to effectuate the task of conversion.

With this argument, Vitoria had considerable sympathy, listing it among the potentially valid bases of Spanish title in his 1539 relection. He conceded that the pope “has power in temporal things insofar as they concern spiritual things.” It was also within the pope’s discretion to entrust evangelization programs to single states exclusively—and that this can even include a monopoly on trading rights “if this is convenient for the spreading of the Christian religion.” He went on to hold that monopoly trading rights in the allocated areas were necessary for the orderly progress of missionary activity and therefore were legally valid. Moreover, popes had the power to “distribute” the territories of Saracens to Christian princes “for the preservation of peace and the progress of religion.” That meant that popes had the power to “make new princes for the furtherance of religion … in places where there had never before been any Christian princes.”114 At the same time, though, Vitoria introduced an important cautionary note. If the Indians, of their own free will, allowed missionaries to come among them and preach, then there would be no need, under the circumstances, for the Spanish to depose their rulers and conquer their kingdoms.115 Not surprisingly, the king of Spain, Charles I (better known in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), was displeased to find his policies publicly questioned by self-appointed critics. He ordered the prior of San Esteban monastery to stop his charges from debating this sensitive matter.116 At the same time, though, Charles revealed that doubts were gnawing away even in governmental circles. In 1550, he ordered a suspension of all conquest expeditions and the convening of a special panel of theologians and advisers, to determine the criteria for the lawful waging of wars of conquest.

Of greater prominence than the panel members were the opposing advocates. Arguing against the policy of conquest in the service of conversion was a Dominican bishop named Bartolomé de las Casas. He was the most renowned champion of the rights of the native populations of the New World. Originally from a prominent merchant family of Seville, he emigrated with his father to Hispaniola in the West Indies in 1502, during his teens. There, he became a plantation owner, employing local Indians as slave labor and even participating in military expeditions and slave raids against the Indians. But his life’s vocation was to lie in a dramatically different direction. In 1510, he became a priest, the first to be ordained in the New World. The decisive change in his life, though, took place the following year, when he attended an eloquent sermon by a Dominican friar named Antonio de Montesinos, who denounced mistreatment of the native peoples of the Americas by the Spaniards.117 Las Casas was thereby inspired to enter the Dominican order himself and to make the welfare of the Indian population the great mission of his life.

He presented the panel with a 550-page treatise (Argumentum apologiae), which appears to have been an early version of his major work, In Defense of the Indians. It argued against the Spanish policies and in favor of a strategy of winning natives over to the Christian religion exclusively by peaceful means. On the question of the law applicable to the conquest of pagan peoples, las Casas closely followed Vitoria. Like his predecessor, he conceded the existence of a number of just grounds for war, including forcible occupation of Christian lands, impeding the preaching of the truth faith, and waging aggressive war against Christians. But he was more explicit than Vitoria had been in his emphatic denial, based on firsthand knowledge, that any of these abominable acts had actually been committed by the Indians.121

He took a similar approach to dilatatio. Like Vitoria, he basically conceded its validity. But he went on to argue that it could only serve as a justification for conquest if the acquisition of sovereignty was, in fact, truly necessary to effectuate conversion. In his opinion, it was not necessary.

Sepúlveda advanced four arguments in support of the Spanish conquest policy. The first was that the various sins committed by the Indians (including idolatry and sundry sins against nature) justified war against them. Second was the classic Aristotelian argument that the base nature of the Indians made them naturally suitable for the role of servants to the more advanced and civilized Spaniards. Third was the dilatatio principle. And finally, he argued that Spanish rule provided increased protection to weak and vulnerable natives.123 It is noteworthy that none of these arguments alleged the commission of any offense by the Indians against the Spanish specifically, though the first one rested on violations of general natural law.

If the great debate at Valladolid had little immediate impact, the position of las Casas won official favor in the longer run, largely as a result of the work of a lawyer named Gregorio López de Tovar. Originally from Guadalupe in Spain and educated at Salamanca, he served the Spanish government in various high capacities, including the important post of president of the Council of the Indies (in 1543–60) at the time of the Valladolid debate. He appears never to have visited the New World, but he was married to the niece of Francisco Pizarro.

López’s position was incorporated, in 1573, into a new legal ordinance regulating the conquest process.127 Henceforth, the word “conquest” was to be eschewed altogether, in favor of “pacification.” In dealings with Indian groups, the positive benefits of Spanish rule were to be stressed. But it was also provided that, if the natives were to oppose Spanish settlement and the preaching of the Christian faith, then force could be used against them.128

King Francis I of France is said to have scornfully remarked that he “should be very happy to see the clause in Adam’s will which excluded me from my share when the world was being divided.”137 The English government, not surprisingly, took much the same view. Queen Elizabeth I, in the late sixteenth century, made it clear to the Spanish ambassador that she refused to acknowledge the right of the pope “to partition the world and to give and take kingdoms to whomsoever he pleased.”138

The essence of the English case was that the Spanish had a right to undisturbed possession of whatever lands they actually controlled, but that they did not have a true legal title to other areas. Discovery of the lands did not, on its own, confer title. Vitoria shared this opinion. Discovery “of itself,” he insisted, “provides no support for the possession of these lands, any more than it would if they [the native rulers] had discovered us.”140 King Francis I of France was of a similar mind. “To pass by and eye,” he grumbled, “is no title of possession.”141 The conclusion to be drawn from this was clear: that until and unless the Spanish actually took permanent possession of lands and continuously governed them, other powers were free to step in, even if the Spanish had

law. Later generations (as will be seen) would adopt different terminology for what Suárez called the ius gentium proper. They would label it the “voluntary” (or “volitional”) law of nations. Later, it would more commonly be called the “positive” law of nations. The important point, though, is that Suárez was the first (since Isidore) to articulate the idea of a corpus of man-made international law alongside—and distinct from—natural law, and devoted specifically to the sphere of interstate relations.

Grotius’s conception of natural law, like Suárez’s, was squarely in the line of rationalist thought from the Middle Ages. His definition of natural law as “a dictate of right reason” was virtually identical to that of Aquinas.52 He explicitly voiced a preference for a mathematical approach to the subject, with conclusions rigorously derived from axioms in the manner of Euclidean geometry.53 He clearly distinguished natural law from divine law, which consisted of the commands of God. Natural law, as a purely logical system, was stated to be entirely self-standing, owing nothing to God.54 In a famous statement in his prologue, Grotius went so far as to assert that, even if there were no God at all, natural law would still exist in its full and complete form.55

security, as a primary natural-law right was nothing new. Aquinas had said as much.86 The key difference was that, for Aquinas, self-preservation had been only one of three core natural-law principles (the other two being the nurturing of the young and, crucially, the quest for harmonious social life).

For Hobbes, security was, in effect, the sole basic natural right. It authorized each individual person to take whatever steps are necessary to preserve his existence in a turbulent world. At the root of the Hobbesian “war of all against all” is the regrettable fact that opinions of people will differ as to how far they are entitled to go in exercising this right, with the melancholy result that the various individual rights of survival will clash with one another. Hobbes was, however, able to offer a means of escape from this living hell. This was by harnessing the one and only fundamental duty of natural law: the obligation to adhere to contracts that are freely entered into. Pacta sunt servanda was the standard Latin formulation of this principle: “Pacts must be observed.” The state of nature may have provided nothing that could be said to resemble an ordered human society, but it was within the power of humans to create such a society for themselves, by means of contracts. The way that this could come about, Hobbes posited, was for various individuals to enter into a contract with one another, pursuant to which they would all cede or transfer their natural-law right of self-rule to some third party—who would thereby become the sovereign of a politically ordered society. This sovereign would then have the task of providing for the collective survival of the contractors by making use of the pool of rights that they had conferred onto him.87

This came about as a result of the unsuitability of natural-law doctrine to a world in which powerful central governments were emerging, based in territorial states. In certain respects, to be sure, natural law was eminently suited to serve as a basis of law between sovereigns. Since natural law was radically cosmopolitan in character, it could, without any difficulty, be held to be applicable in the furthest corners of the earth, to every single kind of human society. No law, surely, could be more truly international than that. In other respects, however, natural law was profoundly ill equipped to deal with practical questions of international relations. The reason is that natural law was, from its inception, always seen as basically a set of rules about interpersonal relations rather than about interstate relations. Nowhere is this more evident than in discussions of the law of self-defense, which focused principally on the rights of individuals to use force when assailed by a wrongdoer.

The implications of Hobbes’s ideas for international law were many. One of them—and the one that has attracted the most attention—is that the political sovereignty created by this process was effectively absolute (or, at a minimum, very nearly so). This was because the contracting parties have given up the overwhelming share of their natural-law rights to the sovereign in exchange 

The first was it now became possible to think, more clearly than before, of a state as an entity that was quite distinct from its members—and, more importantly, as an entity with rights, duties, and interests of its own, which are different from, and superior to, those of its members. “A city,” declared Hobbes, “is one person, whose will, by the compact of many men, is to be received for the will of them all.”88 Where the Aristotelian city-state and the Italian communes had been seen as associations between citizens, the Hobbesian state was regarded as a sovereign above its subjects, and distinct from them. For this reason, it was Hobbes, far more than Bodin, who acted as the herald angel of modern conceptions of state sovereignty. It is immediately apparent that this gathering

This brings us to the second major implication for international law of the Hobbesian system. That is, that the sole legal tie between states is provided by natural law. Here, it must be remembered that the Hobbesian state of nature—in which the states of the world lived vis-à-vis one another—was far from harmonious. Its core feature was conflict. Strictly speaking, despite the use of some memorably lurid language, Hobbes did not really see humans as relentlessly bloodthirsty monsters. His state of nature was slightly more abstract than that. It was a condition in which the basic rights of persons (i.e., of states) overlap worryingly, without any means for drawing a sharp line to determine where one party’s right of survival begins and another’s ends. Drawing such sharp lines is the function of a sovereign—but the international arena possesses no sovereign. Consequently, there is an omnipresent potential for conflict, even when actual material warfare is absent. It was this omnipresent potential that Hobbes regarded as a state of continuous war. In principle, there would seem to be no reason that Hobbes’s contractual solution could not be applied at the collective level of state-to-state relations as well as to the individual level. On this view, smaller states would band together into larger ones, and then larger ones into yet larger ones until, eventually, the whole world was comprised in a single sovereign state. Hobbes did not, however, envisage that this would occur. It was still possible, though, for at least a semblance of international order to be brought about by deft employment of the basic natural-law duty to adhere to contracts. States could enter into treaties with one another—treaties that they would then be under a natural-law duty to fulfill.

Hobbesian vision of international order was indelibly marked by two crucial features. First, it was a world that was intrinsically conflictual rather than harmonious. Peaceful and orderly relations between states were not impossible, but they had to be painstakingly and consciously constructed by purely human initiative, from below. There might be islands of order, but they are protrusions from an ambient ocean of conflict, whether actual or potential. The second crucial feature of the Hobbesian international world was that any orderliness must be entirely treaty-based (although treaties did not necessarily have to be in the form of written documents, with fancy lead seals). There was no detailed body of substantive natural-law principles to guide the statesmen of the world.

One of Zouche’s contributions to international law was the invention of an early version of what became the modern name for the subject (albeit in the Latin tongue). In place of the received expression “ius gentium,” he suggested substituting “ius inter gentes.” That is, he favored speaking of a “law between nations” instead of a “law of nations.” The reason behind this proposed change was to make it clear that the law governing relations between states was importantly different from the original Roman-law ius gentium, which Zouche correctly explained to be merely “the common element in the law” in transactions between individuals.

d Politics (1670), followed by A Treatise on Politics, published posthumously in 1677. These writings were in a strongly Hobbesian vein. He followed Hobbes in holding that only natural law governed relations between states.108 “[S]ince … the right of the sovereign is simply the right of nature itself,” asserted Spinoza, “two states are in the same relation to one another as two men in the condition of nature.” He flatly pronounced states to be “enemies by nature.”109 If anything, he was even more radical than Hobbes in that he denied the existence of an absolute duty to observe treaties. Once the motive for concluding an agreement disappears—that is, once there ceases to be any advantage in adhering to a treaty—a state has a “full right,” he maintained, to break it.110 The reason is that a ruler owes a higher duty to his own subjects to protect their “safety and advantage” than he does to fellow sovereigns to adhere to agreements.111 Spinoza, however, was exceptional in his

The writing of Pufendorf aptly illustrates the marginal significance attached by the naturalists to treaties. He compared them to contracts in civil law. Just as contracts are private obligations between citizens without being part of the general law of the state itself, so are individual treaties merely private arrangements between states, and hence not component parts of a general law of nations. Some treaties, he conceded, replicated provisions of natural law and, on that basis, could perhaps be said to be something more than mere private arrangements. But he had an especially low opinion of treaties of this sort, on the ground that they risked detracting from natural law. “[C]ivilized men,” he grumbled, “should almost be ashamed to be a party to a pact the articles of which say no more than they may not clearly and directly violate the law of nature, as if without such a pact a man would not be sufficiently mindful of his duty.”118

The spider represented speculative thought, in which a writer spins out ideas from within his own mind, in the manner of a spider spinning out silk from its own glands. The ant represented mere mechanical conduct, the mindless piling up of facts without any theoretical guidance, like the ants piling up food for the winter. In between—and much the best of the three—was the way of the bee, which involved gathering in material from the outside world, but then transforming it qualitatively into something more useful.1

There is no law of nations outside of the customs followed by nations and the obligations contracted by States. —THÉOPHILE FUNCK-BRENTANO AND ALBERT SOREL

BY 1814–15, French revolutionaries and their grand principles were in very bad odor—at least in the eyes of the governments of the allied states that had defeated revolutionary (and imperial) France, after more than twenty arduous years of war. Among the products of the revolution that the victorious powers were determined to bury were appeals to natural rights against established authority. It had become all too apparent how much damage could be done by persons whom the British politician and polemicist Edmund Burke derided as “speculatists,” with their grandiose plans for the wholesale replacement of a corrupt present with a rational future.1 Burke had nothing but scorn for “those extravagant and presumptuous speculations” that lead revolutionary leaders “to despise all their predecessors, and all their contemporaries.”2 The proper course of action, in his opinion, is to build on the solid basis of the past, and always with due regard to the concrete realities of human experience. International lawyers in the nineteenth century—an unrevolutionary group if ever there was one—largely followed Burke’s advice. Ironically, in so doing they made a revolution of their own. The monarch they overthrew was not, however, of human flesh. It was natural law. It is true that natural law had been gradually loosening its grip over lawyers—at least those of the Grotian persuasion—throughout the eighteenth century. But the nineteenth-century positivists went a decisive step further, by rejecting natural law wholesale and in principle, instead of merely reducing their reliance on it, as writers like Bynkershoek and Martens had previously done. International lawyers would now, for the first time, begin to congregate at the extreme pragmatic end of the international-law spectrum. The age of the ants had arrived. This principled rejection of natural law 

An interesting challenge to this dualist picture is a situation in which a state is prohibited by its national law from doing something that is required of it by international law. An example would be a treaty that required extradition of any person, regardless of nationality, matched against a constitutional ban on the extradition of nationals to foreign states. When the extradition of a national of the state is sought, a direct conflict between the two obligations occurs. Which law prevails in such a case? Anzilotti was ready with an answer to this. He contended that, strictly speaking, the apparent contradiction is only an illusion. The reason is that, within each of the two systems—considered independently of one another—there is no contradiction. International law unambiguously requires one outcome, while national law, equally unambiguously, requires another. There is therefore no clash between the two systems of law, as such.49 It remains the case, though, that the state is in a dilemma. If it adheres to its constitution, then it must breach its treaty obligation. Conversely, if it fulfills the treaty obligation, then it must violate the constitution. The government of the state therefore cannot avoid making an agonizing choice between these two courses of action. Anzilotti’s point, however, is that it is the state itself that faces this dilemma, not either of the two systems of law. The legal systems both remain free of ambiguity or contradiction—and resolutely independent of one another. The real “solution” to this dilemma, then, is that governments should be scrupulously vigilant and take the utmost care that they do not carelessly incur incompatible obligations. The situation at hand, in other words, is merely a demonstration of government negligence, not o

Concerning the common-will version of positivism in general, it may be objected—and it was—that it is not really properly positivist at all. The reason is that the necessary basis of this system is the underlying principle of adherence to contracts (pacta sunt servanda). And this core principle, it may be argued, can only be a principle of natural law. It had been so regarded since at least the time of Hobbes. It may be contended, therefore, that the common will merely determines the content of legal obligations, and that it is the natural-law principle of pacta sunt servanda which actually makes agreements legally binding on the parties. Triepel accommodated this critique by conceding that international law rests, ultimately, on a nonpositivist foundation—not on natural law, but rather on general human psychology.

So high a value did the neo-Hegelian writers place on state sovereignty that they insisted that what was commonly referred to as “international law” was, in reality, merely the sovereign state’s own national law applied to the area of foreign relations—often called “external state law” (Das äussere Staatsrecht), on the precedent of Hegel himself.56 This reflected the essence of the voluntarist position: that the individual sovereigns of each state are the sole authorities who can make or accept law for that state, and that no external agency can impose legal obligations on a state against its will. It is not difficult to see that this approach comes extremely close to denying the possibility of international law altogether. It may be noted that this voluntarist theory entails the rejection of the dualist outlook of the common-will school. (In general, the voluntarists were scornful opponents of the common-will adherents.) According to the voluntarists, the difference in subject matter between domestic law and international law is merely a superficial one. Fundamentally, to the voluntarists, all law is the product of a single source: the will of single, individual states. Consequently, there can be no fundamental difference between national and international law.

From the basic rejection of natural law, combined with the image of international law as a consensual system based on the will of states, it was the shortest of logical steps to conclude that international law can only be understood as a product of history. Only a study of the actual experiences of states can reveal what agreements states have actually concluded at any given time. Here too, the affinity between the positivists and the historical school of law is clear. Furthermore, it became apparent, when such a close study was duly carried out, that one particular group of states had been responsible for agreeing on the corpus of rules known as international law. These were the countries of Western Europe, together with their overseas offshoots in the Western Hemisphere. 

The result of this way of thinking was an apparent paradox. Natural lawyers were, by temperament, social critics, ever striving to bring power to heel under the rule of law.105 At the same time, though, the law to which they were so devoted was static. It was an unchanging corpus of substantive rules—applicable, to be sure, in widely varying circumstances, but fundamentally unvarying. The nineteenth-century positivists were just the opposite. They were conservatives in the sense that they left governments with a largely free hand to operate as they wished, without any carping or nagging. They were nonjudgmental—perhaps to a fault. But their vision of law and lawmaking was intrinsically dynamic. Constant change was its very essence. In this very particular sense, the positivist lawyers could be called “progressives.” There were those who doubted, though, whether constant change, unleavened by even a scintilla of bracing criticism, was necessarily a good thing. Was it not possible that some kinds of change might be bad rather than good? For the overwhelming part, the positivist lawyers displayed little inclination to ask questions such as this. They saw great progress all around them and were conscious that they were playing a part in it, if only at the humble ministerial level rather than as policy makers.

truly, the “body politic.” Consequently, there is an urgent need to remove the myriad governmental distortions and interferences that prevent the natural mechanism from working smoothly. Highest on the physiocratic target list were the various programs under the general label of mercantilism—the elaborate network of monopolies, subsidies, taxes, quotas, employment restrictions, and sumptuary laws—that had the effect of diverting the natural flows and rhythms of the economy into artificial channels. “Laissez faire, laissez passer,” a phrase coined by A. R. J. Turgot in 1757, became their most famous motto. (Like all good propagandists, the physiocrats were very prolific in the production of mottoes.) This clarion call applied most directly to the dismantling of barriers to the free flow of grain between the provinces of France, with the immediate purpose of allowing supplies to flow freely from places of surplus to places of shortage so as to avert famines. It was primarily British political economists who took up the physiocratic ideas and applied them more widely. 

On this point, too, Bastiat was characteristically outspoken. “Our code is this,” he declared: “ ‘The least possible contact between governments, the most contact between peoples.’ Why? Because contact between governments compromises peace, whereas contact between peoples guarantees it.”47 With trade so highly praised as the key to world peace, it is perhaps not surprising to find Richard Cobden, one of the most dedicated British economic liberals of the century, grandly proclaiming that

Its written in legalese and discussed on CSpan instead of major channels. Plus at the time more people were focused on an impending government shut down. Its amazing what kind of egregious laws are passed with out people noticing. In my home state the voting laws were just changed so out of state students attending college would have to re register their drivers license and change license plates if they wanted to register to vote here and virtually no one noticed because people don't follow politics that closely or realize how much of an impact they can have.


One that works and benefits the people who must abide by that law.Assuming that by &quot;good&quot; we mean acceptable in the democratic concept, a &quot;good&quot; law is one which is:1) Clear2) Possible to follow3) Enforceable4) Consistent with the country's constitutional rightOthers would add that the law should also have a &quot;worthwhile purpose&quot; (although worthwhile seems open to value judgments) and which should also be &quot;fair&quot; (but we could also say that laws should be enforced equally or applied equally to all citizens)

If the majority of the population disagrees with the law and does not obey or contribute to its enforcement (say some drug laws) it is a bad law.
Good laws respect the right of individuals to self determination and choice. Laws which represent &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; are also not good laws.

You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two. If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel. Indeed, there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs. It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. You need a lawyer to run the company, because there's so much law. But it's not just business that's affected by this, it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people. 

Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case. 

They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot? My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure. I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing. Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure, with a three pronged hook in the back, and outside it said, &quot;Harmful if swallowed.&quot; (Laughter)

Law sets boundaries, and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do -- you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes -- but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom.
13:18 Isaiah Berlin put it this way: &quot;Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable.&quot; We've forgotten that second part. Those dikes have burst. People wade through law all day long. So, what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries. And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits. Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom. If someone brings a lawsuit over, &quot;A kid fell off the seesaw,&quot; it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit, all the seesaws will disappear. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms, merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes, nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four, because there's no risk associated with it.
14:06


And so here is the fourth proposition. This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to. And there are two essential elements of it: We have to simplify the law. We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. The constitution is only 16 pages long. Worked pretty well for 200 years.

Space Law:
Who has jurisdiction in space?


A State Party to the Treaty on whose registry an object launched into outer space is carried shall retain jurisdiction and control over such object, and over any personnel thereof, while in outer space or on a celestial body.

1. Canada, the European Partner States, Japan, Russia, and the United States may exercise criminal jurisdiction over personnel in or on any flight element who are their respective nationals.
2. In a case involving misconduct on orbit that: (a) affects the life or safety of a national of another Partner State or (b) occurs in or on or causes damage to the flight element of another Partner State, the Partner State whose national is the alleged perpetrator shall, at the request of any affected Partner State, consult with such State concerning their respective prosecutorial interests. An affected Partner State may, following such consultation, exercise criminal jurisdiction over the alleged perpetrator provided that, within 90 days of the date of such consultation or within such other period as may be mutually agreed, the Partner State whose national is the alleged perpetrator either:
(1) concurs in such exercise of criminal jurisdiction, or
(2) fails to provide assurances that it will submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.

The Manufacturers Aircraft Association Inc. (MAA) was created in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to administer a cross-license agreement, issue licenses to aircraft companies, aid the aircraft industry, and encourage aeronautical development. The subscribers were airplane manufacturers who were stockholders and paid fees for every plane that they manufactured. The association protected its members' patent rights. From the day of its incorporation the motives of the manufacturers and the government were publically attacked by the press and Congress. The association was investigated numerous times by congressional committees throughout its history. In 1965 the government filed an anti-trust suit against the association. After a lengthy legal battle, the M.A.A. was dissolved in 1977.
The Association came into being when the United States government realized the utility of aircraft in military operations in 1916. Therefore inventions, patents, and design rights applicable to aircraft became a national interest. Because aeronautical development in the United Stated was seriously retarded by litigation over the validity and value of important airplane patents, the government thought that natural expansion and normal growth of the industry seemed impossible. In 1917 the Hon. Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Acting Secretary of the Navy, and Hon. W.M. Ingraham, then Acting Secretary of War, requested the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to study this problem (the N.A.C.A. was created by congress in 1915 to advise the president and the executive departments on aeronautical questions).
The N.A.C.A.'s plan was to create an organization independent of the government. The Manufacturers Aircraft Association was formed to administer a cross-license agreement, issue licenses, aid the aircraft industry, and encourage aeronautical development. The M.A.A. was incorporated in the State of New York in 1917. The subscribers of the association were airplane manufacturers. They were stockholders and paid fees to the association for every airplane that they manufactured. In return the association protected their patent rights. It had a patent research division, extensive files on patent history, and published informational bulletins and reports for the subscribers.

A trial was held in 2008, concluding in May, to calculate damages. Judge Allegra found that the total royalties due to Boeing should be $16.9 million.

According to the judge's ruling, Boeing began experimenting with ways to reduce the weight of its airplanes in the 1970s and '80s, a move spurred by high jet fuel prices. The company's experiments focused on aluminum-lithium alloys, which had previously been shunned by the industry because they were thought to fracture easily.

Boeing eventually developed a composition that could be heat-treated with a process called low-temperature underaging to create an alloy suitable for airplane manufacturing, the opinion said. The company patented the underaging process in 1989 and licensed the patent to three aluminum manufacturers.

Around the same time, NASA began working on ways to reduce the weight of the space shuttle's external tank, in part because of weight restrictions related to construction of the International Space Station, according to the opinion.

The space agency contracted with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co. to design a new external tank, the ruling said. In 1994, a team of NASA and Lockheed employees began using low-temperature underaging to strengthen the alloy used in the tank. The new super-lightweight tank first flew in a shuttle mission in 1998 and is still used today.

In 1998, Boeing came to believe that Lockheed was using its patented technique to develop the new tank and offered to license the patent to Lockheed, according to the opinion. Lockheed did not acknowledge the offer and told Boeing to take up any allegations of infringement with NASA.

According to the ruling, Boeing then sued the space agency in 2000.

NASA unsuccessfully argued that the alloy used in the shuttle had a different chemical composition and used a different type of heat treatment than alloys made according to Boeing's patent, the ruling said.

The patent-in-suit is U.S. Patent Number 4,840,682, issued in 1989 and titled &quot;Low temperature underaging process for lithium bearing alloys.&quot;

America’s largest tech corporations are using a business technique called “efficient infringement,” meaning they calculate benefits of stealing patented technology against possibility of getting caught, tried in court, and paying damages and penalties. If benefits exceed costs, they target and steal. Two aspects making patent theft extremely attractive are: 1) infringement is not a criminal act, and 2) those found guilty face no jail time. Being fined is the worst fate of the perpetrator, small change for defense contractors.
 
The most aggressive users of this patent theft business model are fifteen of America’s largest tech corporations, at least one on the missing MH370. Leading them all is Cisco, the biggest competitor of ZTE and Huawei, two Chinese defense contractors represented on board the Malaysian Airlines missing Boeing 777. Following Cisco are Intel, IBM – that had a CEO on board MH370, Microsoft and HP. For years, these multinationals have spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress to buy legislation that would weaken existing U.S. patent infringement laws


Market power can be exercised in other economic dimensions, such as quality, service, and the development of new or improved goods and processes. It is assumed in this definition that all
competitive dimensions are held constant except the ones in which market power is being exercised;
that a seller is able to charge higher prices for a higher-quality product does not alone indicate market
power. The definition in the text is stated in terms of a seller with market power. A buyer could also
exercise market power (e.g., by maintaining the price below the competitive level, thereby depressing
output). The Agencies note that the law is unclear on this issue.
Market power is the ability profitably to maintain prices above, or output below, competitive levels for a significant period of time. The Agencies will not presume that a patent, copyright, or trade secret necessarily confers market power upon its owner. Although the intellectual property right confers the power to exclude with respect to the specific product, process, or work in question, there will often be sufficient actual or potential close substitutes for such product, process, or work to prevent the exercise of market power. If a patent or other form of intellectual property does confer market power, that market power does not by itself offend the antitrust laws. As with any other tangible or intangible asset that enables its owner to obtain significant supracompetitive profits, market power (or even a
monopoly) that is solely “a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic
accident” does not violate the antitrust laws. Nor does such market power impose on the
intellectual property owner an obligation to license the use of that property to others. As in
other antitrust contexts, however, market power could be illegally acquired or maintained,
or, even if lawfully acquired and maintained, would be relevant to the ability of an
intellectual property owner to harm competition through unreasonable conduct in connection
with such property.

Aquinas - god pushes us towards beatitude through law - and he give us natural law.
The Gentle Civilizer of Nations: The Rise and Fall of International Law 1870-1960

How can human beings rule over other human beings? God has dominion over human beings. Human beings have been made in the image of god. God hands that dominion over to human beings, dominion In Se, dominion over our own liberty. Using that dominion we create institutions. In particular two types of institutions. Dominion propietatis. Dominion euprincipitatiotes. Property is the other form of dominion. Property relations are not between humans and things, but between humans. Human relations of jurisdiction and dominion. They are not natural law.

Muslims now call for Sharia, muslims in the time following Mohammeds death attempted to divine sharia from the texts of the Koran. The laws were founded in divine authority. I.e. introduction of tax systems that were backlisted to mohammed to give them religious legitimacy. 
Traditional islamic law has very little to say about criminal law. Its about inheritcane law, its about property law. Its enforce by appeal to the Qadi, enforcement by local judges. The law was created by academics, not judges. the law is not made by god. the work jurisprudence is a human endeavor, they are trying to uncover what god has said, what does obedience look like. This is why the Hadith, why Shafi becomes important. People were using the word Sunna, and were wondering what this meant.   - -Similar to constitutional originalists - “judges deciding constitutional issues should confine themselves to enforcing norms that are stated or clearly implicit in the written constitution- the court should find a right to exist in the Constitution only if it is expressly stated in the text or was clearly intended by its framers. “discovered within the four corners of the document.” Meaning of a constitutional provision was set when it was adopted, and that it can be changed solely by amendment. For example - liberty and abortion.

A Constitution is unique because it is difficult to change. Great britain, for example, has no written constitution. Whereas legislative enactments can be modified by another statue, the Constitution can be amended only by a much more elaborate and difficult procedure. Why should a society generally committed to majority rule choose to be governed by a document that is very difficult to change? Laurence Tribe puts it: “Why would a nation that rests legality on the consent of the governed choose to constitute its political life in terms of commitments to an original agreememnt - made by the people, binding on their children, and deliberately structured so as to be difficult to change?” Hardly original to say “to prevent tyranny of the majority”. If the structure of government was placed in a statue, there might be an overwhelming tendency to create dictatorial powers in times of crisis. If protections of individual liberteis were placed in statues only, a tyrannical government could overrule them. If terms of office were specified in a statue rather than in the constitution, those in power could alter the rules to remain in power. 

Islamic law is the result of academic investigation instead of judicial ruling. What is most important is what god’s prophet on earth acutally said, and what traditions were legitimate, rather than deciding on the basis of equity.

S_REALPOLITIK

Sell the idea that hitler had no real personal opinion on the jews. It was all manipulation of the german people.

Each man had to struggle between the instincts of self-preservation and the admonitions of duty. I, too, was not spared by this struggle. Always when Death was on the hunt, a vague something inside tried to revolt. It strove to present itself to the weak body as reason, yet it was only cowardice, which in such disguises tries to ensnare the individual. A grave tugging and warning set in, and often it was only the last remnant of conscience which decided the issue. Yet the more this voice admonished one to caution, the louder and more insistent its lures, the sharper resistance grew until at last, after a long inner struggle, consciousness of duty emerged victorious. By the end of the events in the Beta Sector this struggle had for me been decided. At last my will was undisputed master. If in the first days I went over the top with rejoicing and laughter, I was now calm and determined. And this was enduring. Now Fate could bring on the ultimate tests without my nerve shattering or my reason failing.  

For these people change their convictions just as the soldier changes his shirt in war – when the old one is bug-eaten. In the new programme everyone gets everything he wants. The farmer is assured that the interests of agriculture will be safeguarded. The industrialist is assured of protection for his products. The consumer is assured that his interests will be protected in the market prices. Teachers are given higher salaries and civil servants will have better pensions. Widows and orphans will receive generous assistance from the State. Trade will be promoted. The tariff will be lowered and even the taxes, though they cannot be entirely abolished, will be almost abolished. It sometimes happens that one section of the public is forgotten or that one of the demands mooted among the public has not reached the ears of the party. This is also hurriedly patched on to the whole, should there be any space available for it: until finally it is felt that there are good grounds for hoping that the whole normal host of philistines, including their wives, will have their anxieties laid to rest and will beam with satisfaction once again. And so, internally armed with faith in the goodness of God and the impenetrable stupidity of the electorate, the struggle for what is called 'the reconstruction' can now begin.

When four years have passed, or in the meantime if there should be some critical weeks during which the parliamentary corporations have to face the danger of being dissolved, these honourable gentlemen become suddenly seized by an irresistible desire to act. Just as the grub-worm cannot help growing into a cock-chafer, these parliamentarian worms leave the great House of Puppets and flutter on new wings out among the beloved public. They address the electors once again, give an account of the enormous labours they have accomplished and emphasize the malicious obstinacy of their opponents. They do not always meet with grateful applause; for occasionally the unintelligent masses throw rude and unfriendly remarks in their faces. When this spirit of public ingratitude reaches a certain pitch there is only one way of saving the situation. The prestige of the party must be burnished up again. The programme has to be amended. The committee is called into existence once again. And the swindle begins anew. Once we understand the impenetrable stupidity of our public we cannot be surprised that such tactics turn out successful. Led by the Press and blinded once again by the alluring appearance of the new programme, the bourgeois as well as the proletarian herds of voters faithfully return to the common stall and re-elect their old deceivers. The 'people's man' and labour candidate now change back again into the parliamentarian grub and become fat and rotund as they batten on the leaves that grow on the tree of public life – to be retransformed into the glittering butterfly after another four years have passed.
Scarcely anything else can be so depressing as to watch this process in sober reality and to be the eyewitness of this repeatedly recurring fraud.
Rewrite as Beksinski

As I have said, only a very credulous soul could think of binding himself to observe the rules of the game when he has to face a player for whom those rules are nothing but a mere bluff or a means of serving his own interests, which means he will discard them when they prove no longer useful for his purpose.
An essential characteristic of what are called the great questions of the time is that thousands undertake the task of solving them and that many feel themselves called to this task: yea, even that Destiny itself has proposed many for the choice, so that through the free play of forces the stronger and bolder shall finally be victorious and to him shall be entrusted the task of solving the problem.
Thus it may happen that for centuries many are discontented with the form in which their religious life expresses itself and yearn for a renovation of it; and so it may happen that through this impulse of the soul some dozens of men may arise who believe that, by virtue of their understanding and their knowledge, they are called to solve the religious difficulties of the time and accordingly present themselves as the prophets of a new teaching or at least as declared adversaries of the standing beliefs.
Here also it is certain that the natural law will take its course, inasmuch as the strongest will be destined to fulfil the great mission. But usually the others are slow to acknowledge that only one man is called. On the contrary, they all believe that they have an equal right to engage in the solution of the difficulties in question and that they are equally called to that task. Their contemporary world is generally quite unable to decide which of all these possesses the highest gifts and accordingly merits the support of all.
So in the course of centuries, or indeed often within the same epoch, different men establish different movements to struggle towards the same end. At least the end is declared by the founders of the movements to be the same, or may be looked upon as such by the masses of the people. The populace nourishes vague desires and has only general opinions, without having any precise notion of their own ideals and desires or of the question whether and how it is impossible for these ideals and desires to be fulfilled.
The tragedy lies in the fact that many men struggle to reach the same objective by different roads, each one genuinely believing in his own mission and holding himself in duty bound to follow his own road without any regard for the others.
These movements, parties, religious groups, etc., originate entirely independently of one another out of the general urge of the time, and all with a view to working towards the same goal. It may seem a tragic thing, at least at first sight, that this should be so, because people are too often inclined to think that forces which are dispersed in different directions would attain their ends far more quickly and more surely if they were united in one common effort. But that is not so. For Nature herself decides according to the rules of her inexorable logic. She leaves these diverse groups to compete with one another and dispute the palm of victory and thus she chooses the clearest, shortest and surest way along which she leads the movement to its final goal.
How could one decide from outside which is the best way, if the forces at hand were not allowed free play, if the final decision were to rest with the doctrinaire judgment of men who are so infatuated with their own superior knowledge that their minds are not open to accept the indisputable proof presented by manifest success, which in the last analysis always gives the final confirmation of the justice of a course of action.
Hence, though diverse groups march along different routes towards the same objective, as soon as they come to know that analogous efforts are being made around them, they will have to study all the more carefully whether they have chosen the best way and whether a shorter way may not be found and how their efforts can best be employed to reach the objective more quickly.
Through this rivalry each individual protagonist develops his faculties to a still higher pitch of perfection and the human race has frequently owed its progress to the lessons learned from the misfortunes of former attempts which have come to grief. Therefore we may conclude that we come to know the better ways of reaching final results through a state of things which at first sight appeared tragic; namely, the initial dispersion of individual efforts, wherein each group was unconsciously responsible for such dispersion.
In studying the lessons of history with a view to finding a way for the solution of the German problem, the prevailing opinion at one time was that there were two possible paths along which that problem might be solved and that these two paths should have united from the very beginning. The chief representatives and champions of these two paths were Austria and Prussia respectively, Habsburg and Hohenzollern. All the rest, according to this prevalent opinion, ought to have entrusted their united forces to the one or the other party. But at that time the path of the most prominent representative, the Habsburg, would have been taken, though the Austrian policy would never have led to the foundation of a united German Reich.
Thus the foundation of the German Reich was not the consequence of any common will working along common lines, but it was much more the outcome of a deliberate struggle for hegemony, though the protagonists were often hardly conscious of this. And from this struggle Prussia finally came out victorious. Anybody who is not so blinded by partisan politics as to deny this truth will have to agree that the so-called wisdom of men would never have come to the same wise decision as the wisdom of Life itself, that is to say, the free play of forces, finally brought to realization. For in the German lands of two hundred years before who would seriously have believed that Hohenzollern Prussia, and not Habsburg, would become the germ cell, the founder and the tutor of the new Reich? And, on the other hand, who would deny today that Destiny thus acted wiser than human wisdom. Who could now imagine a German Reich based on the foundations of an effete and degenerate dynasty?
No. The general evolution of things, even though it took a century of struggle, placed the best in the position that it had merited.
And that will always be so. Therefore it is not to be regretted if different men set out to attain the same objective. In this way the strongest and swiftest becomes recognized and turns out to be the victor.

S_ECONOMICS


	Axiom - we build systems that we can’t understand, so we can’t predict all possible causes of failure. That is inherent in the business of building complicated systems. Does that mean we shouldn’t ever build anything of things will always be really risky. the answer is no, There is something you can do. Even though we can’t say all the ways in which it might fail, we can say all the things that must occur to succeed. What that means is that you can actually design a system to detect deviations of all the things that need to succeed. So to succeed, you need to stay within the bounds of certain state variables. You can separate yourself from the worry of all the ways it might fail, to focus on all the things that need to go right for it to succeed. Then you can always detect against that finite set of things that must succeed. - To respond to failure, it takes time. Since response takes time, if the response takes a long period of time, even though you can detect it, you still may not be able to do anything about it - so you have to be able to detect it early enough. So launch abort systems, you need to be able to detect whether or not the ship is exploding, or if the you are losing control so that you will not be able to abort in the future. Of course these are time dependent, because the signal may be sent too late.
	redundancy management - if I have a failure in one of these systems, I have another that can take over. That will only work if that take over and continue happen faster than the failures. - this is a fundamental axiom of control theory. If you are going to detect and respond to a failure, that detection and response had better be faster than the thing you are responding to.
		If you do an investigation, and no one is at fault, you can still fail.
triplex computing - 1:44
	prognostication - failure prediction
failure masking - three identical computers performing the exact same calculations, so the goal is to make sure you have correct computation from the set of three computers, so you could have a voting scheme. The voter says, if any one of the computers gives me a value that is differnt than the other two - so after the voting, you can be assured that you are getting the correct value, even if one of the computers is outputting an incorrect value. Even though the failure is internal, you never see it at the interface level.

temporal redundancy - git/p4
information redundancy - error detection and correction codes - put in extra bits into signal, when you recieve signal, firmware uses the extra bits to detect if there is a bit flip in a certain set of data, so there is enough information there to reconstruct the correct signal.
knowledge redundancy - how does one detect that oneself is getting dementia? You can not be an adequate judge of your own behavior. If your mind is going bad, you can’t use your mind to determine that. To determine if something is wrong, you can’t use the object itself to determine that. Using knowledge separate from the system itself to help make decisions.

Any engineered system has a goal. You can always talk about its purpose. For any engineered system, what ultimately matters is whether it achieves its purpose, or whether it does not. So the first step is to ask, what does it mean to suceed, then put boundaries around those behaviors, and anything that falls inside is acceptable, outside is not.

redundancy plays a central role in fault management.

We have an education bubble. Bubbles are characterized by things costing more than they are worth. They are characterized by intense psycho-social dynamics. Its very hard for people to suggest that you shouldn’t go to the best college you can get into, becaause people don’t know what else to do. Bubbles are characterized by abstracts from reality. Education is an abstract filler. What is it specifically you are learning? You are investing by consuming. Education is an insurance policy - its not worth as much as people are paying for it, but they are scared of falling through the cracks in our society, so they pay more and more for it. In reality, its the opposite of an insurance policy. Its a kind of zero sum tournament where what really matters is getting into the best schools. And then a diploma from a third tier university is really a dunce hat in disguise. Its a zero sum tournament masquerading as a higher education. The homogenization of higher education prevents individuals from asking of themselves, “What are you really good at, that other people aren’t so good at.”

Earth has begun to turn towards the resources that space has to offer. There are many initiatives, both public and private, to exploit these resources. The majority of which, offers itself in the lucrative asteroid mining business. Among these are gold, cobalt, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium, and tungsten. Near earth asteriods have been picked over. A class of easily recoverable objects (EROs) was identified by a group of researchers in 2013. Twelve asteroids made up the initially identified group, all of which could be potentially mined with present-day rocket technology. Of 9000 asteroids searched in the NEO database, these twelve could all be brought into an Earth-accessible orbit by changing their velocity by less than 500 meters per second (1,800 km/h; 1,100 mph). The dozen asteroids range in size from 2 to 20 meters (10 to 70 ft)

In 1997 it was speculated that a relatively small metallic asteroid with a diameter of 1.6 km (0.99 mi) contains more than $20 trillion USD worth of industrial and precious metals.[6][47] A comparatively small M-type asteroid with a mean diameter of 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) could contain more than two billion metric tons of iron–nickel ore,[48] or two to three times the annual production of 2004.[49] The asteroid 16 Psyche is believed to contain 1.7×1019 kg of nickel–iron, which could supply the world production requirement for several million years. A small portion of the extracted material would also be precious metals.
Although Planetary Resources says that platinum from a 30-meter long asteroid is worth 25–50 billion USD,[50] an economist remarked that any outside source of precious metals could lower prices sufficiently to possibly doom the venture by rapidly increasing the available supply of such metals.[51]
Development of an asteroid-orbit manipulation infrastructure could offer an irresistible return on investment.[52] However, astrophysicists Carl Sagan and Steven J. Ostro raised the concern that altering the trajectories of asteroids in nearby interplanetary space could cause a catastrophic collision with Earth. These scientists conclude that stringent controls on the misuse of orbit-engineering technology be instituted.[52][53][54]

	Early in the life of the solar system, dust and rock circling the sun were pulled together by gravity into planets. But Jupiter, the largest planet, kept a number of the pieces from coalescing into another planet. Instead, its gravity disrupted the formation process, leaving an array of unattached asteroids.
	The Main Belt once contained enough material to form a planet nearly four times as large as Earth. Jupiter's gravity not only stopped the creation of such a planet, it also swept most of the material clear, leaving far too little behind for a planet of any size to form. Indeed, if the entire mass of the Main Belt could somehow create a single body, it would weigh in at less than half of the mass of the moon.

At 590 miles (950 km) in diameter, or about a quarter of the size of our moon, Ceres is round yet is considered too small to be a full-fledged planet. However, it makes up approximately a third of the mass of the asteroid belt.

Privatized U.S. corporations have launched and funded space programs geared towards the wrangling of mineral rich asteroids into near earth orbit. Among these are AAMC - American Asteroid Mining Corporation, and GLI - Gold Leaf Industries. These coroporations dominate the space sector, and do so for multiple reasons.
AAMC was created in wake of patent litigation against John Knowles and co., an engineering group that patented an engine that allowed for travel up to ___, allowing trips to the asteroid belt and back in 30 days, in an extremely cost efficient manner. The American government’s anti-trust challenge was settled out-of-court. In return for the government's agreement not to pursue its case against Knowles Co. as a monopolist, Knowles agreed to divest the controlling interest it had acquired in smaller space industry companies, and to allow non-competing independent tech companies to utilize. Knowles co. became a government sanctioned monopoly and was rebranded AAMC. 


Litigation may also make smart-phones dearer. Mr White of Bristol York estimates that device makers already have to pay royalties for 200-300 patents for a typical smart-phone. Patent costs are 15-20% of its selling price, or about half of what the hardware components cost. “If 50 people [each] want 2% of a device's value, we have a problem,” says Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School.  ---- You can attack them by going after earth assets. --- Competitiveness via export/import bank. - See Aerospace Industries Association

AIA is lobbying congress to get bill that allows private resource gathering of M-type asteroids. This has national security interests because it would functionally corner the market on such metals a’la DeBeers monopoly on diamonds. Introduce artificial scarcity/market fixing, etc. Necessary to do it before Eastern nations do. Private American corporations want splitting market off the table because it would have a destabilizing effect on the economy - in order for it to work it would require a magnitude of trust across nation states never seen.

“The Experiment” is one such covert operation. A brain trust including engineers from AIA have banded together and produced an interesting result. This is what Beksinski destroys in the prologue. 

	First they have to invalidate Beksinski’s patent on the engine. Beksinski owns “Trade Secret” on engine, companies in AIA owns patents on manufacturing processes, but have failed thus far to re-engineer beksinski’s device. Beksinski’s trip has generated a kind of space race and focus on law reform. 




Stability means rigidity. Communism would introduce a whole new measure of existential crisis to the modern man. Our current mode of capitalism has abandoned the level of creative destruction that allowed humans to be human. Our corporations have existed for centuries, and there is no identity except through them. They own the capital, the patents, the foundation of our society.
Capitalism - trickle down conflict.

Beksinski. He managed to produce a computational intelligence which far surpasses anything humans could hope for. He at first tries to use the machine to his advantage, to fufill his dream of the dissolution of the nation state model.  focuses on his efforts and its effect on a few individuals on earth. However, as the story progresses, Beksinski becomes more and more convinced he has created ‘god’;  he believes that this is the highest form of intelligence attainable, and that it is responsible for creating universes, and that, somehow, this intelligence has become a prophet through which the intelligence of our universe can commune.
	Intro Conflict: Beksinski attempts to instigate global conflict by exploiting the weaknesses in the nation state model. The focus is on intellectual property, monopolies, international law, space law, and the patent system.
	Climax: 
	Cliffhanger: Moto discoveries strange weapons on Anatolia.

Book 2 focuses on the discovery of alien weaponry pointed towards earth on Anatolia, which is to be revealed at the end of book one. This discovery completely upsets Beksinski’s plan and the development of NWO on earth. Patent voided, treaties enacted that effectively cement nation state sovereignty as nations join together to create Fleet to deal with this external threat. Beksinski becomes ostracized as his dealings with the aliens and the destruction of the Expirement comes to light. Tensions with aliens flare in conflict over resources. Intelligence community plays critical role in analyzing capabilities of aliens and in creation of plans for debilitating first strike on alien industry.

They did so, because they estimated that humans were about to discover the technology within the century, and they wanted to make sure that the right person got it first. They did this because they were concerned that our society was still governed by the nation-state model. The few other societies that had developed such technology had a common law that applied to its own people, and as such they were not engaged in the creative destruction of the capitalist model. They viewed this model as only necessary if nations were at-odds with eachother. At what point can we slow down and gain stability for all citizens?

Great differences exist between Louisianan civil law and common law found in all other American states. While many differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law, the &quot;civilian&quot; tradition is still deeply rooted in Louisiana private law and in some parts of criminal law.
One often-cited distinction is that while common law courts are bound by stare decisis and tend to rule based on precedents, judges in Louisiana rule based on their own interpretation of the law.[15] This distinction is not absolute, though. Civil law has its own respect for established precedent, the doctrine of jurisprudence constante. But the Louisiana Supreme Court notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines: a single court decision can provide sufficient foundation for stare decisis, however, &quot;a series of adjudicated cases, all in accord, form the basis for jurisprudence constante.&quot; [16] Moreover, Louisiana Courts of Appeals have explicitly noted that jurisprudence constante is merely a secondary source of law, which cannot be authoritative and does not rise to the level of stare decisis. [17]
Property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law are still strongly influenced by traditional Roman legal thinking. Louisiana law retains terms and concepts unique in American law: usufruct, forced heirship, redhibition, and lesion beyond moiety are a few examples.
Due to the civil law tradition, Louisiana's constitution does not contain a right to a trial by jury in civil cases, although this right is contained in the Louisiana Revised Statutes. Additionally, appellate courts have a much broader discretion to review findings of fact by juries in civil cases.[18] Also, damages are apportioned differently from in common law jurisdictions; specific performance is almost always available, and juries may hear cases that would be considered equitable in other jurisdictions.
In commercial law, the 49 other states have completely adopted the Uniform Commercial Code standardizing the rules of commercial transactions. Louisiana enacted most provisions of the UCC, except for Article 2, which is inconsistent with civil law traditions governing the sale of goods. However, several articles regarding the incorporation of terms into a contract have been adopted into the Civil Code. Louisiana also refers to the major subdivisions of the UCC as “chapters” instead of articles, since the term “articles” is used in that state to refer to provisions of the Louisiana Civil Code.
Legal careers are also molded by the differences. Legal education, the bar exam, and standards of legal practice in Louisiana are significantly different from other states. For example, the Louisiana Bar Exam is the longest of any state, at 21.5 hours. The Multistate Bar Examination is not administered in Louisiana.

The kinds of changes that the Aurignacian people were experiencing in France were typical of the unstable world of northern Eurasia during this time. An excellent and dramatic example of these changes is provided by the pollen record from the Lago Grande di Monticchio in southern Italy. The pollen record spans the past 100 thousand years and so includes the period between 50 and 30 thousand years ago. The site records constant and rapid shifts in the landscape around the lake, from steppe through wooded steppe to forest and back. It is precisely these kinds of changes that were happening across many areas and to which the people of Eurasia had constantly to adapt and re-adapt. The most striking insight provided by Monticchio is the speed of change as the major vegetation changes were taking 142 years on average. This means that one generation of humans might have been living in a forested landscape, their children in wooded steppe, and their grandchildren in open steppe.
       	The kind of brusque ecological ghanges that we saw in Monticchio were not unique. They typified the contact zone at this time of huge climatic and environmental turnover. The Siberian Arctic was, paradoxically, stable though cold but humans only managed incursions here after 36 thousand years ago. But the animals of the far north did come south and west as their habitat expanded and they came into contact with humans on the fringe areas of southern Siberia and west all the way to France. This edge between woodland and treeless habitats waxed and waned many times along a narrow belt between plains and mountains. This was the tension zone, in places like the Altai, the Carpathians, and they Pyrenees, wehre humans were being stretched to the limits of their ingenuity and it is right across here that we see cultures and technologies that we define as transitional or early Upper Palaolithic. This was the novelty sector were over and over again, for fifteen millennia, survival battles were won and lost.

The decade that started in 1998 saw a heated debate between scholars in pursuit of an idea. As it turns out it was a sterile debate without hope of being resolved satisfactorily, for the simple reason that both sides failed to recognize the limitations of the evidence at their disposal.

By the time the classic Neanderthals had emerged, during the last interglacial around 125 thousand years ago, they were already a people doomed to extinction. Like the hippos, rhinos, and elephants of the Eurasian forest, the Neanderthals were a population of lifing dead, existing on borrowed time. Like these other mammals, the Neanderthals had a short-lived moment of reprieve as the climate warmed up. The next time the climate would be this generous, 100 thousand years lateer, Neaderthals, straight-tusked elephants, and narrow-nosed rhinos would no longer be. Only their fossils would remain, buried and waiting to be discovered by another human who would ponder the nature of his own existence and presumptuously imagine his involvement in the debacle of his distant cousin, the Neanderthal.


It's probably best not to think of space as a physical object, although to an extent that's more of a philosophical question, I guess. I find that it's usually not helpful to think of space as something physical - something that can be sliced, bent, twisted, and broken like soft cheese - because it often leads people to jump to incorrect conclusions about the nature of the universe. Space is not &quot;sucked into a black hole&quot;, for instance.
When we talk about space expanding or warping, you can think of it as us changing the rules of geometry, rather than us actually bending a physical thing. When space expands, it's the same as saying that the distance between objects is increasing. When gravity &quot;bends space&quot;, we're saying that that there's a sort of &quot;space-time distance&quot;, and that this &quot;distance&quot; between points changes when there's gravity. Or, we're saying that a &quot;straight line in space-time&quot; is something that is affected by gravity.
Thinking of space as a physical object may be a useful analogy, but it may really be best to think of &quot;bending of space-time&quot; etc as geometry just following different rules that you're used to: that angles, distances, and straight-lines do not follow the classical rules.

Heating gas hydrogen and deuterium gas. If you think of the diff states of matter, you heat from solid/liquid/gas, if you heat further, you reach another state of matter - plasma. that is reached as soon as the atoms are split into their electrons and their ions. You separate atoms into pos and neg. particles. The cores lose the shell that is compoosed of electrons. It makes the whole atom neutral. ONce they leave the ion, the whole ion conglomerate. Its like an electron soup where they all float around.  So what are the physicla properties. Its not a gas. Its more accurate as a two fluid model. The charges of the two atoms are now visible. If you have electromagnetic forces, you see the plasma react to tehse fields. A neutral gas doesn’t react to this, a plasma does. You can split negative electrons and positive cores by putting a neg. electromagnetic field around it. THere is a mag. field. particles will actually separate. From that separation, there arises an electric field. There are also acts on itself. There is self effect of the plasma, and that leads to all sorts of new physcis. 

The challenge for fusion reacion power plant, you have to manage the plasma. it is extremely hot, so you can’t let the plasma touch the bucket its in. The temp is above 10 mill degeress, which is hotter than any material, so we need to control it in a way that it doesn’t touch any surroundings. So we generate mag fields to use Lorentz force to manage the particles, and the plasma as a whole. So first there is magnetic confinement. There is a mag field, and the particles are confined in the field lines. So they make a torus mag field. particles are confined in that regard. At this point, there is separation of particles, the ions will drift to the upper, the electrons to the lower, so the

The best theoretical explanation for understanding why neutrinos travel faster than light is the following theory: When Neutrinos are produced at CERN in Switzerland, they travel at the speed of light, but, as soon as they pass the border from Switzerland to Italy, they do not respect laws any more, and they travel much faster than light.

Your second question (serfs answer to lords who answer to kings) is rather easily disproved off-hand by examining Occitania where land could be held in allod (ie. 'of' no one). While the Occitan aristocracy might owe 'feudal' obligations for certain territories and titles they also held lands entirely in their own right not owing services to any king for them. On the issue of serfs and peasants, if the model was as neatly cut as you wish to believe then how could a king demand the homage and fidelity of his entire populace as John of England did in 1209? Surely he would only need the homage of his aristocracy and could rely on the rest through the feudal pyramid. There were also royal dominions (demesne - although like 'fealty' that term is anachronistic; dominion and oaths of fidelity are less loaded and useful) in which peasants answered directly to the king. In no small part 'feudalism' is being discarded because it enables these kind of oversimplifications.
The medieval world was rather diverse. It doesn't fit into neat categories and systems. The chief problem with feudalism is that it is anachronistic on the one hand, and impossible to usefully define on the other. It has little merit either as a representation of what was going on in medieval society up to c.1200x1300 or for systematising that society as historians.
Edit (addition):
This was a working draft of a conference paper I wrote (now discarded because it's far too long) but it explains the role of homage and its multiple functions:
I begin with a description and explication of one of the most famous medieval rituals: homage. Homage was an act in and of itself, but the ritual was often combined with two other distinct and not wholly necessary acts. As you can see from the image here the doer, kneeling, places his clasped hands between those of the receiver, while doing this he would utter his intention to become the man (hominium) of the receiver. Then, standing, the homager would recite an oath of fidelity, while touching a holy relic or the Gospels to sanctify his oath. Finally, the doer and the receiver would kiss. These rituals are layered in nuanced meaning carefully weighed for the public that would witness them – a vital mechanism for enforcement in a non-documentary legal culture – but even when legal apparatus began to take a written form the ritual remained popular and public.
Homage was done in this manner but there were a host of performative variables which are almost invariably lost to us in the dry charter source which survive. Did the doer bow their head in submission or meet the gaze of the receiver? Did the two share a cup or dish at the feast to further demonstrate their friendship, if a feast held at all? Yet its meaning was not solely constricted to one interpretation or used for one purpose. Homage can be somewhat anachronistically systematised into four key archetypes: 1) feudo-vassalic; 2) peacemaking; 3) recognition of status or rights; and 4) lateral agreements. So what do these archetypes mean? Well, they encapsulate the entire scope of high medieval politics in the Middle Ages.

Peter Thiel - 
If you have technological progress, that encourages a capitalist system. On the other hand, if you dont, you end up with much more of a zero sum game, with much less progress, and someone’s gain is someone else’s loss. In this scenario you get a bull market in politics, where people try to use government to get things for their particular interest group, and the whole thing can spiral downwards. It can become a vicious cycle where more government regulation leads to less technology, leads to greater demand for politics to redistribute the pie that is no longer growing. Fastest airplanes have gotten slower, medicine/healthcare has seen limited progress over last 20 years, energy has very limited progress. A lot of these sectors correlate with heavy government intervention.

If technology is stalled out, you will see a trend towards more government, even though it is less likely to fix things. 

Our gov is not engineers - substance and building things

“A world in which there is little progress represents a radical departure from the past. The U.S. constitutional system can’t work without growth.

If you are a difficult person there is nothing for you. That sort of a political mechanism works quite well so long as the pie is growing. If the pie is not growing, there is no incentive to cooperate, and to craft new legislation. . We’ve had 200 years of growth in the western world. The only year in which there was strain was when economic stressed constitutional strain. A Republic doesn’t work without growth.

            <Text>At night the dogs howl like wolves. The cats hiss at the emptiness inside shadows. When morning comes, the oxen refuse to get up as if they know there’s no longer any point to pulling a plow. The animals can sense it, the Solitant priests claim. They turn their shaven heads to the west and watch the sun rise with expectant eyes, for it is the sun which will carry the fire that will consume the world and end it.
But there’s always been a dog howling somewhere, and there’s always been a priest pointing at it as proof. 
End of the world? Destruction of all humanity?
Happening soon?
Mandrameen was not so optimistic.
He doubted it would ever happen because there was no profit in it. Folks can’t make money off it, and worse, if it happens, then they won’t be able to keep making money. If a prophecy says that the dogs of Jeket will howl for ten days and nights and then the world will end, then an enterprising man, hoping to protect his investments, could hire a few other men to go and slaughter all the dogs of Jeket. How could a prophecy about howling dogs come true if there are no dogs to howl? 



 the Sand focuses this beauty. There the desert heat pulls the mind out from the body, like a cork from a bottle, and if you are left to linger in the sun, all desires, plots, and fantasies will evaporate. Nothing is left to support a delicate ego. When Nature’s beauty rushes in, it flushes the ego out, it loses it in the wide open spaces of sand and sky. All that’s left for the inner eye to see is the truth about the edge between one’s self and the Universe.
Or so Mandrameen believed. 
It was at least an honest attempt to explain why all religions of the Empire were born in the Sand, and why the beating heart of each of them is the grand city of Jeket, Jewel of the Desert, an oasis in the middle of the world.



That it’s not the end of the world as a whole, but the end of the Hrkan world. Hrkan hegemony over the will be broken.

The only uncertainty for these priests is what comes after. Yes, there will be unbearable pain and gnashing of teeth as has not been seen since ancient days when armies were so large that their snaking across the desert stirred up sand-storms in their wake, but what comes after? Depending on who’s telling the story, it will all end in either the creation of a more perfect world, or the coming conflagration will leave the earth an ashen wasteland, or, some argue, it will all end in nothingness. This divergence in opinion was allowed because the prophecies never said much about what would come after the end, and it wasn’t something that could be deduced by squeezing portents out of lizard guts and stool. The only thing that was certain was that the world was indeed ending. 
Ending soon.

There's other versions of your question which I think are pretty easy to see are not true. Consider all the times that you've realized something but haven't been able yet to put it into words. Clearly in those cases your thoughts are not being constrained by language -- you know something that you can't yet name. Similarly, people throughout history have invented new concepts (e.g. the concept of a &quot;galaxy&quot;) and then proceeded to name them afterward. It is still a deep, open question in cognitive science how new concepts are acquired (or what even the ontological structure of a &quot;concept&quot; is), but it seems clear that they're not completely constrained by language. 

The human language is not a prison for the human mind. The main reason: If necessary, one can dismiss natural language, and choose or invent different means for expressing thoughts or to communicate:
In the field of art, languages like painting, dance, music etc. serve to communicate. These languages continuously expand.

What had so far cooled my enthusiasm for fairy dowsing were the bowdlerized tales of the Brothers Grimrn and the saccharine pedantry of the fairy world of Disney. Surely a truer, more brilliant, more vivieing world of nature spirits must be clamoring to be verified. 

Walking through the woods, I do not see the spirits, but I sense them all around me, and I no longer feel alone. My communion with plants, no longer metaphorical, is actual as I consciously breathe in life from their leaves and return the gift transmuted by my lungs, aware that sylph and undine have transmuted those leaves from sunlight. 

All of nature assumes a magical vesture. Like Aleister Crowley, I swim in nature like a fish in the sea, and nature swims in me like the sea in a fish! Even ticks, fleas, lice, and mosquitoes find an explanation when attributed to the plethora of noxious thoughts produced by humans. No longer do I rail at the inanities, inadequacies, and injustices of a totally corrupt politico-scientific establishment; I am more sanguine now, certain that they, too, will mend their ways. Instead of recoiling at the sight of some physically or spiritually distasteful person, I now rejoice that but for some angelic grace that person could be me and in some distant way is me. And it is sobering to realize that nothing one does, says, or thinks can escape the scrutiny of a vast and friendly audience-eyes wide, staring in wonder from the underbrush-only waiting to applaud the least sign of an upright, noble, or loving gesture. 


 The roots of plants, said Francé, burrow inquiringly into the earth, the buds and twigs swing in definite circles, the leaves and blossoms bend and shiver with change, the tendrils circle questingly and reach out with ghostly arms to feel their surroundings. Man, said Francé, merely thinks plants motionless and feelingless because he will not take the time to watch them.

rishment they die and are replaced by cells designed to dissolve mineral salts and collect the resulting elements. This basic nourishment is passed from cell to cell up through the plant, which constitutes a single unit of protoplasm, a watery or gelatinous substance considered the basis of physical life.
The root is thus a waterpump, with water acting as a universal solvent, raising elements from root to leaf, evaporating and falling back to earth to act once more as the medium for this chain of life. The leaves of an ordinary sunflower will transpire in a day as much water as a man perspires. On a hot day a single birch can absorb as much as four hundred quarts, exuding cooling moisture through its leaves.

No plant, says Francé, is without movement; all growth is a series of movements; plants are constantly preoccupied with bending, turning and quivering. He describes a summer day with thousands of polyplike arms reaching from a peaceful arbor, trembling, quivering in their eagerness for new support for the heavy stalk that grows behind them. When the tendril, which sweeps a full circle in sixty-seven minutes, finds a perch, within twenty seconds it starts to curve around the object, and within the hour has wound itself so firmly it is hard to tear away. The tendril then curls itself like a corkscrew and in so doing raises the vine to itself.

The sundew plant will grasp at a fly with infallible accuracy, moving in just the right direction toward where the prey is to be found. Some parasitical plants can recognize the slightest trace of the odor of their victim, and will overcome all obstacles to crawl in its direction.

To protect themselves plants develop thorns, a bitter taste, or gummy secretions that catch and kill unfriendly insects. The timorous Mimosa pudica has a mechanism which reacts whenever a beetle or an ant or a worm crawls up its stem toward its delicate leaves: as the intruder touches a spur the stem raises, the leaves fold up, and the assailant is either rolled off the branch by the unexpected movement or is obliged to draw back in fright.
Some plants, unable to find nitrogen in swampy land, obtain it by devouring living creatures. There are more than five hundred varieties of carnivorous plants, eating any kind of meat from insect to beef, using endlessly cunning methods to capture their prey, from tentacles to sticky hairs to funnel-like traps. The tentacles of carnivorous plants are not only mouths but stomachs raised on poles with which to seize and eat their prey, to digest both meat and blood, and leave nothing but a skeleton.
Insect-devouring sundews pay no attention to pebbles, bits of metal, or other foreign substances placed on their leaves, but are quick to sense the nourishment to be derived from a piece of meat. Darwin found that the sundew can be excited when a piece of thread is laid on it weighing no more than 1/78,000 of a grain. A tendril, which next to the rootlets constitutes the most sensitive portion of a plant, will bend if a piece of silk thread is laid across it weighing but .00025 of a gram.

supply strength of the long hollow tubes that support fantastic weights against terrific storms. A plant’s use of fibers wrapped in spirals is a mechanism of great resistance against tearing not yet developed by human ingenuity. Cells elongate into sausages or flat ribbons locked one to the other to form almost unbreakable cords. As a tree grows upward it scientifically thickens to support the greater weight.

The Australian eucalyptus can raise its head on a slim trunk above the ground 480 feet, or as high as the Great Pyramid of Cheops, and certain walnuts can hold a harvest of 100,000 nuts. The Virginia knotweed can tie a sailor’s knot which is put to such a strain when it dries that it snaps, hurling the seeds to germinate as far as possible from mother.

Plants are even sentient to orientation and to the future. Frontiersmen and hunters in the prairies of the Mississippi Valley discovered a sunflower plant, Silphium laciniatum, whose leaves accurately indicate the points of the compass. Indian licorice, or Arbrus precatorius, is so keenly sensitive to all forms of electrical and magnetic influences it is used as a weather plant. Botanists who first experimented with it in London’s Kew Gardens found in it a means for predicting cyclones, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
So accurate are alpine flowers about the seasons, they know when spring is coming and bore their way up through lingering snowbanks, developing their own heat with which to melt the snow.
Plants which react so certainly, so variously, and so promptly to the outer world, must, says Francé, have some means of communicating with the outer world, something comparable or superior to our senses. Francé insists that plants are constantly observing and recording events and phenomena of which man—trapped in his anthropocentric view of the world, subjectively revealed to him through his five senses—knows nothing.
The blooms are edible. They taste spicy. 

Fenestrated leaves. 

the problem several minutes, then conceived a worse threat: he would burn the actual leaf to which the electrodes were attached. The instant he got the picture of flame in his mind, and before he could move for a match, there was a dramatic change in the tracing pattern on the graph in the form of a prolonged upward sweep of the recording pen. Backster had not moved, either toward the plant or toward the recording machine. Could the plant have been reading his mind?

 “Maybe plants see better without eyes,” Backster surmised: “better than humans do with them.” With the five basic senses, humans have the choice, at will, of perceiving, perceiving poorly, not perceiving at all. “If you don’t like the looks of something,” said Backster, “you can look the other way, or not look. If everyone were to be in everyone else’s mind all the time it would be chaos.”

During the next few months, chart after chart was obtained from all sorts of plants. The phenomenon appeared to persist even if the plant leaf was detached from the plant, or if it was trimmed to the size of the electrodes; amazingly, even if a leaf was shredded and redistributed between the electrode surfaces there was still a reaction on the chart. The plants reacted not only to threats from human beings, but to unformulated threats, such as the sudden appearance of a dog in the room or of a person who did not wish them well.

For nine hours Backster got an active chart recording from the egg, corresponding to the rhythm of the heartbeats of the chicken embryo, the frequency being between 160 and 170 beats per minute, appropriate to an embryo three or four days along in incubation. Only the egg was store-bought, acquired at the local delicatessen, and was unfertilized. Later, breaking the egg and dissecting it, Backster was astonished to find that it contained no physical circulatory structure of any sort to account for the pulsation. He appeared to have tapped into some sort of force field not conventionally understood within the present body of scientific knowledge.
The only hint as to what sort of world he had wandered into came to Backster from the amazing experiments in the energy fields around plants, trees, humans, and even cells, carried out at the Yale Medical School in the 1930s and 1940s by the late Professor Harold Saxton Burr, which are only just beginning to be recognized and understood.

He looked and said, in his usual disinterested manner, “Seems normal.” 
Moto kept one eye closed as he peered through the lens. He was squinting so tight that his  Looked almost so that his upper lip nocked up to reveal his.
“Are you sure?” Elrahet grumbled. She was never happy.
“It’s hard to tell,” said Moto. “We’re gonna have to wait a bit. I can’t see much more than a few black specks and a cloud of dust. They’re moving fast though, that’s for sure.”
Seb shaded his brow with his hand and tried to spy their quarry. He traced a line straight out from the pass towards the oasis at Gelf, hoping, with his poor sight, that his eyes would stumble over the coming caravan. 
“It should be obvious,” Elrahet said. “A hard tell is a foul tell.” 
“They’re still way far out,” Moto said. “We’ll know for sure in a bit.”


Seb couldn’t find them. His eyes weren’t just bad, they were terribleBut he looked for them anyways. He always looked because he had come to believe, privately, that he had the ability to see the true natures of living things as a glowing aura. He couldn’t see the details, but that was okay because the blur of things far off gave him more important information. 
He’d never actually seen a colorful aura before—black things blurred black, and brown things blurred brown—but he believed that he’d eventually be able to see them because the blessed witch had told him he would. She didn’t put it so plainly, but she never put anything plainly, and if she ever did then there was sure to be layers of meaning hidden underneath the surface. What she did tell Seb was that all his strengths were weaknesses, and all his weaknesses were strengths.

 His near-sighteness was a weakness, and because of this weakness, people didn’t trust his judgment. </Text>

            <Text>Things are so much more interesting when they move. Mandri used to paint pictures of great cormin lizards sprinting along the sand. These were real dynamic pieces that took forever to compose. He’d pull out all the tricks but could never get beyond the mere suggestion of movement. Like, he wouldn’t paint the lizard mid-leap, because if he did that the lizard would, paradoxically, feel static. It would feel flat, like it was fly-swatted onto the canvas. Instead, he’d the lizard it right before it was about to jump. He’d try to capture that coiled energy rippling in the hind legs and tail. It was the suggestion of something about-to-happen. That was always more dramatic than something currently-happening. It still sucked compared to the real thing. It sucked compared to the fact that, when high, he could watch the salt that stained his field ooze up out the ground. Now that was fascinating. The salt had been working its way up into the soil since he bought the place.

‘Do you have any conception of eternity? Kuts on kuts. Eternity. Conssequences.’(mark zuckerberg) I feel like you’re not getting it. Give this to salavan as he hovers over Mandrameen.


“Look, when I work on a painting, sure, there’s some moments of inspiration, and that feels great. Then I walk out of the room for a while. Then I walk back in with fresh eyes, and like I said, half the strokes I thought were brilliant were just wrong. It was, I don’t know… Inspiration is fake, that’s all I know. It’s like puppy love. It’s not real.”
Salavan paces back and forth.
“Yes, what do those fools in the guild say? It about perspiration not inspiration.”
“It is.”
“The problem here, Mandri, is that when you leave the room, you fill yourself back up with bullshit, and so of course, that is all you can see. But I assure you, inspiration, creativity, whatever word you want to use to hide the voice of god, use it - but that doesn’t mean it isn’t there.”
“Let me see your paintings, then, Salavan. Let’s see these works of divine inspiration.” 
“As I’ve already told you, I am not artist.”
“Damn right you’re not.”
“Nonetheless, I am right.”
“If you were right, I wouldn’t have to take your word for it.”
“You don’t have to. Simply kneel, and start painting. Soon enough, you will see the truth.”

“You know, I’m impressed,” Salavan continued. “Perhaps now you realize the strength of your own Will. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it - the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing? And now here you are! Doing it! Well, you tried to. It’s the attempt I admire.” He took a step forward. “But here, let me show you how it’s done.” 
 “Did you ever dream of committing murder?” Salavan asked. He put the knife up against Mandrameen’s throat. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this? It’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan peered into Mandrameen’s gasping mouth. “Yes, I can see it!” Salavan exclaimed with glee. “Hah! I can see it there inside of you now! The way everything is squirming in there.” He set the knife’s blunt edge against Mandrameen’s tongue and pressed down. “Yes! Gods, you really fucked this up Mandrameen. When you pass on into the Hell, that should be your final thought, that this is all your fault.”


“I saw what I saw.”
“I don’t deny that you did, but Mandri, but you did not understand what you saw. Pell was not, as they say, consuming that spark for sustenance.”
“Sure as shit looked like she was.”
Salavan sighed in frustration and rested his hands on his belly.
“Come now, Mandri. Indulge, for a moment, the idea that you have been deceived, that everything you know about Schisol and Solraheen is a lie. The heavens, the earth, the very nature of existence itself, is not what you think it to be.”
“And you know the truth?”
“No living person knows the whole truth, but one thing is certain: the story of how Solraheen came to be buried under the earth is a lie.”
“What are you talking about? I’ve been to Jeket.”
“They let you see Him?”
“No…but I know He’s there.”
“He is there, yes, crushed under all that rock and Fabled Black. But unlike you, I have been allowed into the Jeketian caves, and I have glimpsed His face, and I’ll tell you, He did not look pleased with His situation.”
“Why would He? He’s crushed under a comet.”
“You should see what they do to Him. They inundate his air with deadening fumes. They carve slivers from his flesh to fuel their abominations.”
“You mean the Mazydai?”
“I mean abominations. Think of it, Mandri, if it weren’t for the power of the Mazydai, the Hrks would never have conquered the outland tribes. This story that you’ve heard, that a stone of night fell from the sky and Solraheen saved the world by absorbing the crushing blow with his own body, well, it is simple and neat, but it is not the truth.”
Salavan put his fat finger up on the fresco, and he poked he Schisol’s belly, right where Soloraheen’s sword burst forth.
A click sounded out from under the floor, and a square of stone levered open to reveal a narrow stairway descending into darkness. 
Salavan said, “Before we head down, I must demand from you your utmost commitment. I, unlike the Solitants, value honesty, so my good character compels me to warn you that there is a chance—a chance—that as we attempt to divine your role in the divine plan, you could die. It’s only a chance, and a small one at that. Consider the thought before you join me.”

“Him Who had once throned there between the Cherubim, and Who was still King over Zion.

Here in the impenetrable gloom of the innermost sanctuary, which the High-Priest alone might enter once a year for most solemn expiraion, had stood the Ark, hte leader of the people into the Land of Promise, and the footstool on which the Shechinah had rested. From that golden altar rose the sweet cloud of incense, symbol of Israel’s accepted prayers; that seven-branched candlestick shed its perpetual light, indicitive of the brightness of God’s Covenant Preence; on that table, as it were before the face of Jehovah, was laid, week by week, “the Bread of the Face,’a constant sacrificial meal which Israel offered unto God, and wherewith God in turn fed His chosen priesthood. On the great blood-sprinkeled altar of sacrifice smoked the daily and festive burnt-offerings,…

Prostitituion of the holy office.

 &quot;remarkably absent-minded, in regard to the common things of life,&quot; but &quot;intensely exercised about the higher and eternal realities.&quot; 

The dust of ten centuries wiped from the eyelids of those sleepers, and one of them who thronged jerusalem in the highday of its glory.

Not worthy to loose the latchet of my shoes.

John - he only held open the door of the new Kingdom; himself entered it not, and that was least in that kingdom was greter than he


Durant - nietzche
Greeks - why do you force me to say what is better left unheard? The best is unattainable. Better to be never been born. To be nothing. Then to have died early.
It is only through the aesthetic phenomenon that existence seems justified. The subliime is the subjugation of the awful. Pessimism is a sign of decay. Optimism is a sign of superficiality. Tragic optimism is the mood of the strong man who seeks intensity and intent of experience, even at the cost of life. Tragedy is the proof that greeks were not pessimists. 

If evil were not good it would have disappeared.
Cruelty consitutied the great joy and delight in ancient man. And he believs that our pleasure in the tragic drama or in anything sublime is a refined and vicarious cruelty. Man is the cruelest animal, sayeth Zarathustra. When gazing at tragedies, bul fights and crucifixions, he felt happier than at any other time on earth. And when he invented hell, Lo, hell was his heaven on earth. He coudl put up with suffering now by contemplating the eternal punishment of his opperssors in the other world.

The stench of shopkeepers, the wriggling of ambition, the evil bread. There is no use in such men in having wealth because they cannot give it the dignity of noble use, in the discriminating patrogane of letters or the arts. Only a man of intellect should hold property. At last man becomes a bird of prey. THey live in ambush of one another, attain things by lying in wait. They seek the smallest profits out of every sort of rubbish…and these men call out for laiseez fair, to be let alone, these men who most need supervision and control. Perhaps even some degree of socialism should be justified here. 

A general who uses a soldier on the battlefield, who have the pleasure of dying under the anasthesia of glory, is far better than the employer who uses up men in his profit machine. Observe with what relief a man leaves their factories for the field of slaughter. Napoleon is not a butcher but a benefactor. He gave men death with military honors instead of death by economic attrition. People flock to his standard because the prefer the risks of battle than the unbearable monotony of making another million collar buttons.

            <Title>Temple</Title>
            <Text>Old Elrahet was the new pacesetter, and so their slow march into the evening was a welcome relief to Mandrameen. The canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky overhead dimmed into purpler hues. It was near the golden hour when the path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau. Behind them was the bewildering maze of canyon cracks that stretched out for miles before fading into the dark rift of the Pass. In front of them was a structure that blurred the line between the work of Nature and the work of humanity, for at once it was both a building and a mountain, at once a fat, flat-topped spire of stone and a temple whose walls were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes; circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles, and these shapes came together to roughly resemble faces. Animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval the size of four-floor building demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a crow, and the beak of the crow was the nose of a snarling demon. These designs wrapped around the lower floors, though these were still high up, for the temple sat on top of a sloping hill of rock rubble, rubble laid down by both the right and left despoiling hands: time and humanity.
This was Shulgi, the sanctuary of the Greskalun, and Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders of humanity get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights Shulgi should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered can only heighten the glory of the Hrkan conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the crown of crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays made the structure seem to burst in flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was an empty husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arch windows, each as black and empty of candlelight as the last. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
Moto jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramless column. Then he led them all up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs that led to the temple entrance. And these were troublesome stairs, steep, at least a hundred of them, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms, for every step had it’s own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He supposed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be a number of other substances. Perfumant wine. Red berry brine. Ink. It could be slurried excrement; a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere. Odd that they’d have it running out the front door. It could also be blood. Out of these possible explanations, blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin. It explained why he felt fear when he looked up at the black, yawning mouth that was Shulgi’s entrance, an entrance true to all senses of the word. It was sculpted, using the language of clean geometric, into the stylized head of a viper. When Mandri that this dark stain of his fascination was staining the viper’s gums.
Moto stopped before entering. He drew his sword as if he were about to do battle with the building itself.
“Alright,” he said, “Everyone turn back around… We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside the temple if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Purl was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of Purl’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet bowed and said, “Then take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.” 
Moto stared down elrahet.
“Or,” said Elrahet, “you can run away and explain to Ayram why you left his witch all alone.”
The anger.
“Okay. But if I want to I’m going 
And he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torchsmoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and flew over everyone’s heads.
“I told you it wasn’t empty,” Moto said as he watched the bats swerve along the temple wall and then disappear back into some unseen hole.
Elrahet snarled and said, “Aren’t you a little big to be scared of a few bats?”
“There’s more than bats in there and you know it,” Moto declared. “It smells too foul to be empty.”
“He’s right,” said Purl. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“I suppose you would know,” said Purl.
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind. Mandri was last to enter.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, and thrice as long as wide. The torchlight could only tease the distant darkness. In the middle of this dimness, dugout of the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that filled almost to the brim with white ash. Wind and time had swept some of this ash around the room, trails of it . Frost., painting especially a cross-legged figure sitting on the opposite side.
Moto waved his torch back and forth. He shouted, “Hello there,” but his words echoed harmlessly around the room. The figure, robed in green, was sitting cross-legged, slumped, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was a bald head, almost as pale as Obo’s.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?”
“You’re the one that said ‘hello’.”
“Can I have the torch, please.”
Moto handed the torch to Elrahet, and she walked towards the mysterious figure, but stopped suddenly when she heard the crunch of bone under her shoe. She stepped aside, to reveal the crushed spine of a small creature.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto.
“Or the bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew they were there, he was noticing the scattered remains of small creatures all over the place. Thin bones of lizard legs, bats, foxes, mice, even the shells of beetles. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that figure by the pile of ash and poked him hard with her staff.
The man fell onto his side, the thudding impact kicking up a puff of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is a man, but only just.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe in between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince. Is that what we have here, do you think? Is this young Greskaleen, or a scrounger with a stolen robe?”
Elrahet’s inquisitive demeanor gave Mandri the courage to carry himself into the room. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so long wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were bats and a dead body? Bats were fine, and dead was dead. Aside from the Ayramun, Mandri thought he had nothing worry about. And despite the unnerving sound of little animal bones crunching under his feet, a strange calm washed over him. but then he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, a faint glimmer. There at the back of the entrance hall, shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light, was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a common Old Jandri design, called the closet style, where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling. His golden skin is smooth and his body featureless. His face is round, alive, and enlightened. His pose is rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them and they made this image. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to . More primitive. And it was huge, at least twenty feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a wooden, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. No doubt the source of Mandri’s newfound serenity. Though none of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have expected. A thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to him . What could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin shone was darkly mottled. Tarnished.
Mandri winced at the iniquity. Pure gold cannot tarnish. This meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse: standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine. Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was a narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely—surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s sacrilegious”
“Hornswoggle. The good Lord doesn’t care about gold. Well, he does, but not in the way in which you think. What He really cares about is this man here,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch to a dark lump sitting not ten feet away from Mandri. 
All the Ayramun looked on in earnest at whatever it was Elrahet was pointing at. Purl was the first to realize what it was and gasped. Mandri was the second. Purl’s shock helped him to realize that the protuberance on top of this shadowy lump was an ear. The rest was a mop of dark hair and the back of a neck, albeit a shredded one, with a few links of its vertebral column still attached.
“The Mazyd was right,” Elrahet said. “Though it wasn’t pure hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Mandri . He said, “Are you saying that this green robe guy ate that other guy over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“This place is cursed,” said Moto.
“Cursed!?” exclaimed Elrahet. “Nonsense. This man was one of Solraheen’s champions.”
“How could you say that?”
“Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness. There is no greater struggle. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it took him completely. See here… he was growing horns.”
She turned the man’s chin upright with the tip of her cane, and sure enough, there were two fleshy nubs protruding from his forehead. His jaw lolled open, and a too-long tongue unfurled onto the floor.
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
She held the torch low to the ground, and there, half buried in ash, was a round stomach still full with that final meal. The man had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, though they were still partially attached to the abdominal wall. The stomach was black, nearly as black as fabled black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooking in flames, it seemed to Mandri that it was black for other reasons. If the torchlight was truthful, the stomach was still wet and still subtly contracting.
Elrahet reached down with her blade? and cut the stomach open without effort. 
Divination is a professionalized art of which Mandri knew very little. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance; there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current events, but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on. But when that stomach snapped open, the stomach itself let loose a demonic scream. 
“Oooookay,” said Moto. “We’re not waiting in here.”
Elrahet was not listening. Her blade was sorting through the stomach’s contents, and her sullen face was fraught with worry. 
“Did you people not hear me? I said we’re leaving.”
Seb said, “Don’t have to tell me twice,” and then he scuttled out the door.
“Evidently I do,” Moto said derisively. Then he looked at everyone else who hadn’t budged, and his ire settled on Elrahet.
“Elrahet,” he said, “Please just do what I tell you to do.”
Elrahet snapped and said, “Go look for Ayram.”
Moto’s shoulders sank. He looked despondently up at the ceiling, and tried to rub the frustration out of his forehead. Then he clapped his hands, and said, “Alright. Alllllright. But if a demon falls down from the ceiling and starts making your insides be outsides, don’t complain to me.”
  He threw his pack down, pulled from it a rock crystal spyglass and hurried out into the oncoming night.
Elrahet shouted after him like a worried mother.
“Don’t stray too far!”.
And like every son with his own ideas, Moto ignored her.
Mandri was too fascinated by the stomach to leave. He watched Elrahet fiddle with the black stomach the site filled him with such . Something bubbled up out of the inky muck.
He pointed and asked, “Is that… Is that a…?”
“Yes,” was Elrahet’s reply.
It was a hand.
Mandri decided then and there that the study of entrails was not for him. He set his Obo-stuffed pack against the wall, and joined the others outside on the temple’s doorstep. 
The evening breeze was a revelation. It told of just how foul the air in that hall really was. Mandri took a deep breath of it, hoping to clear the taint of that vile stomach from his senses. He could still smell it. He could still see it in his mind’s eye, and now that he was thinking about it, he could hear that absurd scream.
  He grimaced. He thought of prettier things. The sun was now a bright pink line in the west and that pinkness washed over a smattering of faint stars who were just beginning to twinkle. The fractured face of the plateau did an admirable job of mirroring the sky, dimly, and grounding the scene. The charm of a sunset is in the grounding of it. Paint a sunset sky without a horizon and it’s just a splash of color. A beautiful sunset is always grounded against the glimmering blackness of the earth or ocean. The grounding is what makes a sunset loud, loud in the way a beautiful woman is loud.
All this would have been enough to drag Mandri’s thoughts away from that black and belching stomach, but Seb was sitting at the head of Shulgi’s stairway, sitting on top of his pack with that dead Riga child still bundled to it, and the man was slurping and chewing his borcandi spines with an unusual ferocity.
“How many of those spines do you have?” Mandri asked him. “You’ve been chewing them nonstop since I met you.”
Seb puckered his lips and sent a wad of spit flying down the stairs. He watched it until it disappeared, then said, “I chew ‘em till there ain’t nothin’ left. A single spine goes a day. Seven a week. Got a hundred and two left.” He gave his pack a few hearty slaps and the Riga’s head juddered.
Mandri looked for Moto and found him up above Shulgi’s entrance arch, sitting sideways in the circle of the viper’s eye. His left leg dangled down, his right arm held on to the rock, and his left hand affixed the spyglass to his vigilant, squinting eye as he watched out for Ayram.
The Hrks were easy enough to find. Their orange torchlight illuminated small sections of distant cracks in the plateau. There were two groups of them, one further back, seemingly stuck and not moving, and one maybe halfway out, wandering in the wrong direction. Outside of these two blooms of light, the canyon curves were many times blacker than the night that was creeping in. Trying to find Ayram in them would, no doubt, be a hopeless endeavor. 
Mandri asked Seb, “What exactly is Ayram doing?”
Seb spat again. He always spat before he spoke, like he had to lubricate his lips in order to say anything. 
“Layin’ a false trail,” said Seb. “Helpin’ the Hrks get turned around in them canyons should be easy to do, ‘specially at night. Lots o’ places to get lost. Ya know they don’t call it the Shattered Plateau for nothin’. Its got doublin’ back places, sideways places, and whatnot. Hard to just keep goin’ straight, ya know?”

“You’d have to have the eyes of a bat to find Ayram in those canyons.” 
Moto sneered down at him and said, “He’s right there.”
Seb grunted in surprise and said, “That was quick.”
Mandri spun around, expecting to see Ayram charging up the steps, but he wasn’t. Mandri scanned up and down all the cracks that weren’t so obscured by canyon curves, but saw nothing. 
“He’s so god-damned fast,” said Seb as he rolled his disbelief, jealousy, and admiration into a sigh. This was, Mandri supposed, the closest Seb could come to actually feeling something resembling respect. It made Mandri want to find Ayram all the more. He’d never seen a giant sprinting. Ayram doing anything was a physical feat,  and so Mandri primed his eyes for movement in the chasm shadows.
Still, he saw nothing.
Moto said, “If I didn't know better, I'd say that he's spooked.”
Seb twisted around and said to Moto, “What makes you say you know better?”
“It's Ayram. The man doesn't get spooked.”
Mandri, eager to be included, said, “I don’t see him. Where is he?”
Seb pretended to wonder if Mandri was blind, then pointed out at the shattered plateau, and said, “He’s right there.”
“I don’t see—oh.”
The reason Mandri hadn’t seen Ayram is because Ayram wasn’t weaving his way through the dark canyons, he was out on top of the plateau, looking a bit like a flea on the back of a scaled lizard hide. He was sprinting towards the temple, leaping across the canyon gaps as he went. Some of these gaps were larger than Mandri thought was possible to traverse, but as Ayram jumped, he stabbed the ground with spud bar and practically threw himself across. The speed and power was incredible, even viewed so far away. 
“Shit!” 
The voice was Moto’s. He’d seen something. He champed down spyglass so that he could clamber out of the snakes eye, and when the distance was manageable, he jumped down. His brow was writ with urgency. He grabbed Mandri under the arm.
“Get inside,” he said.
“What is it?”
“Damn it! Get inside!”
Moto threw Mandri backwards and started to manhandle Seb.
Seb shook his arm free from Moto’s grip. “What’re you on about?”
“Do not argue with me, Seb. Get inside, or I’ll make you.”
“Alright. Alright. Don’t touch me.”
Seb stood up slowly, and took his time getting his pack up off the ground. All the while he was staring off to where he’d last seen Ayram.
“What’d you see?” said Seb.
Moto’s was at an end. He put a shoulder into Seb’s chest and lifted him up off the ground. Seb, being almost half Moto’s size, didn’t fight it, though he did make it as hard as he could letting his heels drag.
Moto marched right past Mandri and gave him a look that could boil bone.
“If you don’t get your ass inside,” he said, and he left Mandri to imagine the details.
Mandri gathered himself up and took one last look out at the shattered plateau. Ayram was still hurtling towards the temple, though he was rapidly approach a crevasse that would, surely, be too wide for even him to jump. 
He didn’t slow down.
“No way,” Mandri muttered.
Afore the gap, Ayram’s stride lengthened into a bounding sprint—one, two, three—his fourth step was right on the edge of the canyon, and with it he launched himself into the air. His momentum was incredible, his form compact, as if he were an arrow shot from a bow.
Suddenly, out of the south, a beam of yellow light exploded into the night and it zipped right towards Ayram. So brilliant and sudden was this flash that Mandri couldn’t help but blink.
When he opened his eyes, Ayram was gone. A cloud of dust swirled in his wake. There, too, running south along the plateau’s criss-crossed face, was a long black scorch mark of freshly smoldering stone. And there, at its distant end, was a shrouded figure standing all alone.
Moto’s hand grabbed the neck of Mandri’s robe and pulled him into the temple, and without so much as a word of warning, Moto dropped him on the floor.
“What was that?” Moteah asked. She had seen the flash but not the source.
Moto shouldered his pack and said, “That was a burst of Mazydfire”.
“How close?”
Moto did not answer. He and in brusque he said
If , she turned to the others and said, “We need to move.”

            <Text>Conference of the Birds
Attar

His date of birth is given by different authorities at various times between 1120 and 1157; modern writers have inclined towards the earlier date. Two manuscript copies of The Conference of the Birds give the date of its completion as 1177, and on internal evidence one would judge it to be the work of a writer well past his youth; this also suggests that a birth-date closer to 1120 than 1157 is likely 

Attar’s travels seem to have been undertaken more in the pursuit of knowledge than patronage; he boasted that he had never sought a king’s favour or stooped to writing a panegyric (this alone would make him worthy of note among Persian poets). Though The Conference of the Birds is about the search for an ideal, spiritual king, Attar obviously had a low opinion of most earthly rulers; he usually presents their behaviour as capricious and cruel, and at one point in the poem he specifically says it is best to have nothing to do with them. The knowledge he particularly sought was concerned with the biographies and sayings of Islamic saints; these he collected together in his prose work Tadhkirat al-Auliya (Memorials of the Saints), which became an important source book for later hagiographers.

 After his wanderings he settled again in his home town, where he presumably kept his daru-khané. There is some evidence that late in his life he was tried for heresy – reading The Conference of the Birds it is not difficult to see why, though the accusation was made against a different poem. The charge was upheld, Attar was banished and his property was looted. Edward G. Browne* points out that this was a not uncommon fate for Persian mystical poets to endure, and that in his last book, Lisanu’l Ghaib, Attar ‘compares himself to Nasir-e-Khosrow, who, like himself, “in order that he might not look on the accursed faces” of his persecutors, retired from the world and “hid himself like a ruby in Badakhshan”.’ 

Sufism was an esoteric system, partly because it was continually accused of being heretical, partly because it was held to be incomprehensible and dangerous if expounded to those who had not received the necessary spiritual training. It was handed down within orders of adepts, who were forbidden to reveal the most important tenets of belief (though some occasionally did), from sheikh to pupil (throughout The Conference of the Birds the word ‘sheikh’ denotes a spiritual leader, not a secular chief). Different sufis living at different times have clearly believed different things, and most sufi authors tend to retreat into paradox at crucial moments, either because they feel their beliefs are genuinely inexpressible by other means or because they fear orthodox reprisal. 

The doctrine is elusive, but certain tenets emerge as common to most accounts. These, briefly, are: only God truly exists, all other things are an emanation of Him, or are His ‘shadow’; religion is useful mainly as a way of reaching to a Truth beyond the teachings of particular religions – however, some faiths are more useful for this than others, and Islam is the most useful; man’s distinctions between good and evil have no meaning for God, who knows only Unity; the soul is trapped within the cage of the body but can, by looking inward, recognize its essential affinity with God; the awakened soul, guided by God’s grace, can progress along a ‘Way’ which leads to annihilation in God. The doctrine received its most extreme expression in the writings of the Spanish Arab pantheist Ibn Arabi, a contemporary of Attar, who maintained that the being of creation and the Creator are indivisible 

sheikh was Majd ad-Din alBaghdadi (died 1219) of the Kubrawiya order 

. Both, significantly enough, were representatives of the more extreme, antinomian and, to many of the orthodox, scandalous tendencies of sufism. 
He broke with the sufi tradition of secrecy and openly taught mystical doctrines; his most famous pronouncement, made while in a state of religious exaltation, was ‘I am the Truth’ (or even ‘I am God’: the relevant word, haq, can mean either ‘God’ or ‘truth’). He was imprisoned for eight years, then tried and condemned to death; he was flogged, mutilated, hung on a gibbet and then decapitated; his body was burned and the ashes were scattered in the Tigris. 

The statement ‘I am the Truth’ was considered a declaration of the non-existence of the Self which has been re-absorbed into the true reality, i.e. God; his death was seen as a warning of the world’s hostility to sufism, which became ever more secretive, paradoxical and esoteric.

The poet Hafez goes so far as to imply that Hallaj died because he had revealed what should be hidden; that is, though to the orthodox his death may have been a punishment for blasphemy, to the sufis it was a punishment for the revelation of a mystery 

. Like Hallaj, Bistami is said to have attained a state of annihilation in God, and like Hallaj he proclaimed the fact in utterances that scandalized the orthodox (‘Glory to Me! How great is My majesty!’ – he claimed to have had a vision of the throne of God and to have seen himself sitting on it). 
However, he escaped outright condemna tion, perhaps by feigning madness, and died in 874 in Bistam. His tomb was made into a very beautiful shrine by the Mongol Ilkhan Uljeitu in the early fourteenth century; much of this shrine still exists. A 
characterized by ghalaba (rapture, ecstasy) and sukr (intoxication); whereas that derived from al-Junaid is based on sobriety (sahw)’ 
Sufism was never simply a doctrine to which one intellectually assented; it was also a discipline for life, and its adepts followed a carefully prescribed ‘Way’. To quote Trimingham again, ‘[readers unacquainted with the writings of sufis] could have no better introduction than Attar’s Manteq at-Tair (The Conference of the Birds) where the seven valleys traversed by the birds of the quest are: Search, Love, mystic Apprehension, Detachment/Independence, Unity, Bewilderment, and Fulfilment in Annihilation 
The purpose of the discipline… is to achieve purification. The aspirant has: to purify his nafs, i.e. his personality-self, from its inclination to shahawat, that is, the thoughts and desires of the natural man, and substitute these with love (mahabba); then he must be cast into the flames of passion (ishq) to emerge in the state of union (wusla) with transmutation of self (fana) through the gifts of dazzlement and wonder (haira) to everlastingness (baqa).’ Attar’s poem then is a description of the stages encountered by the adept of the sufis’ Way. 

Though Attar treats his material in an entirely different way from Sana’i, it is possible that a shorter poem of Sana’i suggested the device of the birds to him. In Sana’i’s Divan there is a poem in which the different cries of the birds are interpreted as the birds’ ways of calling on or praising God. A second source may have been Kalila and Dimna. This extraordinarily popular work, also called The fables of Bidpai, originated in India and was translated into many languages. The Persian texts of Kalila and Dimna which survive are relatively late prose versions, but Rudaki, who lived early in the tenth century and was one of the first poets to write in Persian, made a verse translation of the work, which Attar could have known. Significantly enough, Rudaki used the same couplet form as Attar was later to use for The Conference of the Birds; but a direct influence is impossible to prove, because all but a few fragments of Rudaki’s poem have been lost. In Kalila and Dimna animals talk and act as humans; the fables usually have a moral point to them, and their narratives are allegories of human characteristics and failings. This is precisely the method of Attar’s Conference of the Birds, and the two works also show a similar kind of folksy humour. 

Another work which probably influenced Attar when he came to write his poem is the short Arabic treatise The Bird by Avicenna. This is the first-person narrative of a bird (clearly representing the human soul) who is freed from a cage by other birds, and then flies off with his new companions on a journey to the ‘Great King’. The group flies over eight high mountain peaks before reaching the king’s court; there are a few moments when Attar seems to echo Avicenna’s imagery. 

For example, Persian has a phrase exactly equivalent to the English ‘Be a man!’ (i.e. ‘Pull yourself together and face danger bravely!’); Attar often uses this phrase because he clearly has his true, human audience uppermost in his mind rather than the birds to whom the stories are supposed to be addressed. 

The obscurities are there to ‘allure’ the mind, and the ambiguities of the allegory are the ‘dark similitude’ which ‘will stick faster in the heart and head’. For example, Attar will tell a story about two people, one of whom is clearly God, the other the aspirant sufi, but just as the reader has worked out which is which he will find that he has to change his mind or suspend judgement; the long story with which the poem closes is a good example of this. The reader’s attempts to explain the allegory to himself are what make it ‘stick fast’ 
the Self is seen as an entity dependent on pride and reputation; there can be no progress until the pilgrim is indifferent to both, and the commonest way of making him indifferent is the experience of overwhelming love. Now the love Attar chooses to celebrate (and the stories that deal with love are easily the most detailed and the longest of the poem) is of a particular kind; it is always love that flies in the face of either social or sexual or religious convention. It may be love between a social superior and inferior (e.g. between a princess and a slave); it is very commonly homosexual love; or, as in the longest story of the poem (pp. 57–75, about Sheikh Sam’an), it may be love between people of different religions. In each case the love celebrated is seen by the world as scandalous (it may be objected that homosexual love was not seen by medieval Islam as particularly scandalous, but it is forbidden in the Koran (iv. 20), and in The Conference of the Birds the anecdote about Shebli in the brothel (p. 93) shows that it was commonly thought of as shameful). The mention of scandal reminds us of the ‘scandalous’, i.e. blasphemous, aspects of the Khorasanian tradition of sufism to which Attar belonged; the ‘scandalous’ loves which Attar celebrates, their flouting of convention, are the allegorical counterpart of this spiritually ‘scandalous’ abandonment. 

Attar’s concern to demonstrate that the sufis’ truth exists outside of human conventions also appears in his predilection for stories in which a poor, despised person (a dervish or beggar) is shown as spiritually superior to a great lord or king; and, in common with other sufi poets, Attar will use words like ‘fool’ or ‘idiot’ to mean ‘wise man’ or ‘saint’. The most extreme examples of such an attitude occur in the section where he has pilgrims insulting God. Like many religious poets he loves paradox, as when he has a saint praying that God curse him (because the curse is God’s and thus preferable to a blessing from any other source), and this is part of the same habit of mind – the need to insist that ‘normal’ apprehensions and expectations are questionable, to turn them inside out. 

Readers acquainted with medieval European literature will not find Attar’s method unfamiliar; parallels such as The Owl and the Nightingale and Chaucer’s Parliament of Fowls immediately suggest themselves. Indeed, it is remarkable how close Attar’s poem frequently is in tone and technique to medieval European classics. Like Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, it is a group of stories bound together by the convention of a pilgrimage, and as in Chaucer’s work the convention allows the author to present a panorama of contemporary society; both poems can accommodate widely differing tones and subjects, from the scatological to the exalted to the pathetic (and, occasionally, it must be admitted, the bathetic); both authors delight in quick character sketches and brief vignettes of quotidian life. 

His obsession with idolatory is part of a general Islamic concern, but in The Conference of the Birds, as in a great deal of sufi poetry, the true idol to be destroyed is the Self. 

weeps blood 

Further, narrative poetry depends on what the American poet Turner Cassity has called ‘recitative’. We are used to short poems and expect them to function at a maximum of emotional intensity, like the arias of grand opera. One cannot maintain such intensity over hundreds of pages, and it would be wearying if one could. Narrative poetry needs its workaday recitatives between the arias, its simple conveying of the story from point a to point b. The heroic couplet has been one of the most successful means of effecting such ‘recitatives’ in English. For these reasons – the similarity of the English form to the Persian (which gives the translator at least the chance of reproducing something of the tone and movement of the original) and the necessity of some fairly strict formal scheme if the poem’s meaning is not to be betrayed – we have considered that any drawbacks which may come from eighteenthcentury associations are more than outweighed by the advantages. Our method of translation does, however, owe something to the eighteenth century; we have followed, more or less, the guide-lines set out in Alexander Fraser Tytler’s admirable Essay on the Principles of Translation (first published in 1791), with particular reference to the chapters on verse translation. 



Like him avoid cruel Pharaoh’s hand, and seek 
Your promised home on Sinai’s mountain peak. 
There you will understand unspoken words
 Too subtle for the ears of mortal birds. 

The Self has swallowed you for its delight;
 How long will you endure its mindless spite? 
Cut off its head, seek out the moon, and fly
 Beyond the utmost limits of the sky;
 Escape this monster and become the friend
 Of Jonah in that ocean without end. </Text>

            <Text>Chapter 4 : Moteah
  
______________


        Mandrameen was a poet, and Seculla was a trial lawyer. It might seem that these two callings are as distant from each other as Man is from Woman, but according to Seculla, they were essentially the same - just like Man and Woman. A poet and a lawyer both peddle in the Truth and appeal to human nature.The poet crafts verse and hopes that it will sing when played on the human heart, and the lawyer does the same, just does it more bluntly, with less rhyming and more certainty. The only real difference is that people’s lives are at stake - that and the fact that the lawyer gets paid by the hour.
        Whenever Mandrameen would lay with Seculla, he’d tease her about this. He would say, with a great deal of comic exaggeration, that if a lawyer is just a poet working for money, then a lawyer is no better than a whore. Money cheapens Virtue. A whore cheapens Honor. A lawyer cheapens the Truth. 
Seculla would wave him off with her usual air of grace. She’d argue that there’s no such thing as the Truth. A single murder recounted by three different witnesses will result in three different stories. Unless there’s a bloody knife in hand, we’re all invincibly ignorant. Almost everything boils down to a he-said she-said, yet everyone picks a side. They choose who they want to believe and then invent a rationale for it later. At least a lawyer’s accounting of the Truth is put through trial and error; that alone is enough to make it more valuable than anything any poet has ever written. 
It is little wonder that the two disagreed on how Jeketian society should be structured. Mandrameen believed that all human beings have certain fundamental rights, and that the Law should emanate from these and protect them. Seculla would say that it didn’t matter what anyone thought the law should be, there’s only what it is - a practical thing, a subject to circumstance, politics, and power. She contended that no one has anything by natural right; you only have what you can take for yourself, and you’ll have it for as long as you can defend it. There are no noble laws written on the hearts of men; there is only the law of self-interest.
Perhaps if Seculla had been alive to see the dynamics within Ayram’s band, she might not have been so quick to doubt that Humanity has an intrinsic moral compass. Perhaps if Mandrameen had seen it, he might not have liked the direction that the compass' needle was pointing, for it didn’t point to Liberty or Virtue, it pointed to Ayram. He was a Law unto himself. Within his band there was no contest of wills, there were no practical concerns of property or freedom. Everything was Ayram’s. Not just whatever gold and wealth they found, but every mind, every body, every husband, child, and wife; it was all offered in submission - and that was the thing - Ayram hadn’t taken it, it was all willingly given. 
It was strange to Pyetle, but he could see the natural sense of it. Ayram was just that big. He seemed ageless. In the evening, at the golden hour, when they climbed out of the pit and headed south over rolling dunes to where the horses were hidden, Pyetle thought he could see Ayram’s shadow extending out to the horizon. There was room enough in it to fit all of them.
Moteah trudged up and down the dunes at Pyetles' side. She was his minder.
“The time’s come, Pyetle” she said as Pyetle paused to catch his breath. “We’re going out to the Sand. There ain’t no place there for outsiders, so, you need to make a decision.”
“A decision about what?” Pyetle asked.
“Are you with us?”
“Well, yes,” he said. “I’m here. I’m with you.”
“No, Pyetle. Being with us means being one of us. There ain’t much of a distinction there, but - We don’t take on passengers.”
“You’re telling me to pull my weight.”
“Kind of. I don’t know why Ayram brought you here. You ain’t no killer, and you too old to learn. You don’t offer to help with anything, so you can’t be a roper.”
“A roper?”
Moteah nodded. “A roper. It’s what I call it. I’m a roper. We tie the group together, keep things running smooth.”
“Ah.”
“Every now and then, someone tries to run, and I rope them down.”
“You don’t need to threaten me. I’m not going to run anywhere.” 
Moteah laughed. “It’s a figure of speech, Pyetle. Can I call you Pye?”
Pyetle shrugged.
“Alright, Pye. What I mean is, sometimes some people forget what we doin it for, or they get sad, lonely, or just sick of it - the Sand ain’t a fun place to be - and that’s when I step in with my sunny disposition.” She looked at Pyetle and put on a big smile. Pyetle couldn’t help but smile back.
“You’re in charge of morale?” Pyetle asked.
“I ain’t in charge of nothing. I do what I can for people cause I want to. You have to want to do it.”
“You don’t think I’m that kind of person?”
“Obviously. That’s why I’m talkin to ya. If you ain’t good in a fight, then you need to be good out of it. So Pye, what good are ya?”
“Well… I know bean-curd.”
“Bean-curd?”
“Bean products, but mostly bean curd.”
“You a cook?”
“No. It’s more the buying and selling of it. I would buy soy-bean in bulk from farmers out in -”
“You a middle-man?”
Pyetle nodded. “It’s not as simple as that, but...I guess it doesn’t matter. Not many beans out here.”
Moteah laughed. “Not much buyin or sellin either.”
“I guess I could help out with whatever you need help with.”
Moteah shook her head. “Nah. We’ll find somethin. Ayram put you here, Pye. I learnt a long time ago that he knows best. But still, you need to make a decision to buy in - not just ‘cause we don’t tolerate outsiders. It’s for your own safety.”
“Safety from what?”
“There be things in the Sand that only Ayram can save you from. He won’t save you if you haven’t taken the oath.”
“And what does that involve?”
“It ain’t nothin serious. Well, it’s serious, but I mean, it ain’t nothin too painful.”
“Too painful?”
“It’s a blood oath, Pye. There’s gonna to be blood.”
Pyetle grimaced. “I don’t suppose I have a choice?”
“Oh, we’d kill you if you say no. But you shouldn’t take the oath just because you don’t want us to kill you.”
Pyetle laughed.
“What?” Moteah asked. “You’ve got to be doing it for the right reasons.”
“What reasons are those?”
Moteah shrugged. “It’s different for everyone.”
“Why did you join up?”
“Nah. That’s between me and Ayram.”
“So I either take the oath, or you kill me. That just doesn’t seem like… Well, let’s say I took the oath, but I just said the words without meaning them.”
“There’s no words.”
“Well, ok.... Let’s say I just went through the motions.”
“It ain’t that kind of oath. It’s more… how should I say it… It’s more primitive. Maybe oath ain’t the right word.” Moteah stood up. “You got until we reach them hills over there.” She pointed ahead to the tall foothills of the Junei Mountains. At their pace, they’d reach them by nightfall.
“Is that where the horses are?” Pyetle asked, eager to get in a saddle.
Moteah nodded. “Just about.”
“Well I can already tell you,” Pyetle said as he stood up. “I’m in.”
“Alright.”
Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
        “The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Urghiz is a long way off.”
“Yeah.”
        “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.”

            <Text>‘Believed it provisionally’- seb’s theory about ghosts and faces

The ambush sightspot was a wide midcliff ledge that offered a privileged view of the Junei Pass. It was the last sheer cliff of the Hias, with a tall rock face that went straight down into the clay. It was the perfect spot to keep a watch on the Junei Plain. To the left you could see it snaking up into the mountains, and below and to the right the road cut through the ravine where the ambush lay, where Gugi had found the body, and then you could see every inch of the road as it wound around some foothills, black screes and outcrops of rock, before coming, at last, to the colorful Junei plain. Once out there the road gets lost in the shifting sands, but since it runs straight west towards the Wadi of Gelf, it’s easy for the mind’s eye to follow.
Gugi was up there next to Seb. He had claimed that he could see the coming caravan in the distance. “Way far out”, he said. There were two other Ayramun up there on the ledge, two of Ayram’s nearest:  the Zosan Moto and the bloodwitch Elrahet. Ayram himself was somewhere doing whatever Ayram thought was best. Seb told Elrahet that Ayram ought to know that there was a dead boy on his road, but Elrahet said not to go looking for him. She said, “Ayram will come if he needs to come”, and that was that.
Moto was eying the distant caravan through a rock crystal lens which magnified the distance several times over. That glass was a small treasure, a clear little oval. Moto kept rubbing it with an oil cloth to keep it from fogging up.
He looked through it and said, in his usual disinterested manner, “Seems normal.” 
Moto kept one eye closed as he peered through the lens. He was squinting so tight that his  Looked almost so that his upper lip nocked up to reveal his. Brilliant white teeth. Those teeth were such a contrast to his black skin. They flashed whenever he talked. Seb thought that when Moto talked, it was like he was flapping a torch. 
“Are you sure?” Elrahet grumbled.
“Hard to tell. Gonna have to wait a bit. Naught but a few black specks and a cloud of dust. Moving fast though. That is for sure.”
Seb shaded his brow with his hand and tried to find their quarry. He traced a straight line out from where the Scuttle road emptied into the Junei, hoping, with his poor sight, that his eyes would stumble over the caravan as they traced that line towards the horizon. 
“If it’s hard to tell… that’s not a good sign,” Elrahet growled. 
Gugi ease Elrahet’s worry. “They’re still way far out,” he said. “We’ll know in few fingers.”
Seb’s couldn’t find them. His eyes weren’t just bad, they were terrible. If a thing was up close he could keep it sharp, but‘way far out’ and ‘not too far off’ were smashed together into a blurry haze he called ‘out there somewhere’. He looked for them anyways. He always looked because he had come to believe, privately, that he had the somasight - the rare ability to see the glowing aura of color that encapsulates living things. 
Whenever he had the time to stop and stare like this, he’d do it. He thought the great distance, the detached of distance, might make it easier to see a person’s aura. There’s none of the fakery to get in the way. See, he’d never actually seen an aura before. Be he knew he had the somasight. He knew it because Ayram had told him it was so. Ayram didn’t put it so plainly, but Ayram never said anything plainly, and if he ever did then there was sure to be layers of true meaning hidden underneath the surface. No, Ayram had told Seb that all his strengths were weaknesses, and his weaknesses were strengths. From there it was a few rock solid bounds of logic and reason to figure out that blank is blank, blank is blank, and that blindness is a strength because leads a person to somasight.
If anyone else had said that‘strengths are weaknesses, and weaknesses are strengths’, Seb would have disregarded it, because on the surface, it’s just twisting words. That’s the kind of weak thing that tradesmen and slaves and philosophers do to make them feel better about their lot. But you don’t hammer and twist words around until they mean what you want them to mean. Strength isn’t a weakness, strength is strength. Yes, if you change the context around then strength can become a weakness. Put a muscle-bound man in the water and he can’t swim as fast as a leaner one. But that’s a matter of becoming. And besides, that whole strain of thought is just way too simple. Even children know that things are context dependent. There’s no great wisdom in it. Ayram dealt with wisdom. He dealt with the Truth. He’s a man who knows, more than anyone knows anything, that when you are strong people rely on you. He’s not a man to dress up hardship pretend its all roses. The cold hard fact is that when you can’t see, people don’t rely on you. Sure, being blind means you don’t have to stand on watch for hours, and sure, Seb took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, but to call his nearsight a strength because it made him unreliable… well that was just twisting words. When you’re strong you don’t need to twist words. Ayram dealt with things as they were. He was the strongest man who had ever existed - of that, Seb was certain. Ayram’s hands were almost as wide as Seb’s chest and he was taller than any rumor. Seb had seen Ayram wrestle down a caldrian ox by himself. So for a man like Ayram to say a thing like that, to say‘weakness is a strength’, then there had to be an underlying truth. Something practical. Something Specific. Purposeful. Ayram only ever speaks to bend the world to his will. He has the  the cosmic mechanical nature of things to do it. Ayram was setting Seb down a path. Seb was sure of it.
One day Seb realized that the only other person he’d ever known who’d had vision worse than his was Seculla. Seculla wasn’t completely blind but she was as good as completely blind. She could only see splotches of light and shadow. But if she were looking at a living thing, if she stared at it for long enough and got all glassy eyed and inattentive, then she would begin to see bands of radiant color resolving into the outline of the thing. It was an invaluable skill to have, especially out in the Sand. The Ayramun used her to ascertain the true character of those they’d meet; red for killers and the like, green for gentle folk, gold for the merely curious, and so on. 
Using Seculla as an example, Seb figured that maybe normal sight gets traded for somasight. Or maybe somasight is in everyone, but you’ve got to lose your normal sight to get you ready to receive it, because maybe you’ve got to want it badly and no one could want a thing as bad as someone who’s got nothing at all. This had to be what Ayram was getting at. Seb’s own lack of sight would lead to him having somasight. And it wasn’t a coincidence that Ayram had found Seb and Gugi just a few weeks before Seculla had died. The timing of all that was a clue. Seculla was the only Ayramun with somasight, and with her gone there was no one else who could fill that role. Ayram had chosen Seb for this purpose. Ayram was setting him down that path. It all fit. It was only a matter of time and effort. 
Whenever Seb tried to see auras, he’d mimic what he’d seen Seculla do. She would stand as still as a statue and stare without focus at living things. She’d get all shaky and sweaty as if she were killing herself with the effort. Seb wasn’t sure what was going on inside her head. He had to guess. On the outside it seemed like simple concentration, like she was narrowing the world until it was just her and the person and then she’d command them to reveal their true nature.
So there he was, staring at the caravan that was crossing the Junei plain. Staring in its general direction. His let his eyes cross just enough so that the colorful landscape doubled and blurred until the distant gypsum dunes dissolved into each-other. When the edge between the sand and the sky softened into a gradient of yellow-to-blue, that’s when he began to strain, because at that point there was nothing else in the world but him and the distant caravan. Well, the distant caravan wasn’t there, but he knew it was there, and knowing it was there was enough to make the connection. Or so he figured.
For this he bore the look of a man possessed - jaw hanging loose, breath heavy, muscles tight, skin tingling, repeating in his mind the words that should manifest his will: Show yourself. Show yourself. Show yourself. He could feel the energy screaming out of his eyes. He was scouring all the world with it. He trembled as Seculla trembled. Sweat beaded on his brow. 
Then he caught a faint whiff of an odor. A foul odor. Was it him? It could be the dead boy. He took another sniff and then he was sure; it was him. He mumbled a curse. Things like that made it hard to maintain a general lack of focus.
There were other distractions. There were birds chattering up on the cliff behind. Evidently the sight-spot was was little too close to some nesting brightbeaks. Then there was the bitter flavor and texture of the belti spine as it rolled about in his mouth, and Belt juice stimulates saliva, so he kept having to swallow to keep his spit from dribbling down his chin. When you’re that far up inside your own head, nothing breaks your concentration more than having to swallow. It becomes a conscious act. And somehow it’s loud, like thumping on a soggy drum. Then there were, of course, the itches. On the thigh. That was the worst place to get an itch, the thigh. It feels like an ant bite. Maybe it is an ant bite. And once that thought creeps up, you can’t not scratch it.
The worst distraction though, by far, was Elrahet. The bloodwitch was pouring over every pore and of the dead boy, looking for wounds, mumbling her guttural bloodspeech as she did it. Once or twice she gave a curt shriek and then she would hound Gugi about something or other. Seb tried to cuff out the old crone’s ravings but it was no use. Her grating voice could rattle through rock.
Then she wanted Seb’s attention. 
“Seb!”
“What?”
“Seb, you ass!”
“What?”
“Listen to me when I’m talking to you.”
“I am.”
“You smell like a donkey’s teet.”
“I know.”
“Do something about it then.”
“It’s hot.”
“So what it if it’s hot? Splash yourself in musk oil, or whatever you ejits do these days.”
Bloodwitches were cantankerous creatures. Elrahet especially so. You had to let it go because she was old as old can be. Seb had never figured her exact age. Numbered age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. There’s no number for the age of a grain of sand, and Jandrimun like Elrahet were just as elemental. Her features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree. She was shrouded in layers and layers of brown rags. If she went swimming in the ocean she’d blend right in with the seaweed. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable cracked-back lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The dead lizard was two heads taller than the dead boy, counting from its nose to the nock of its tail. It’s scales were red, it’s belly was white, and it was washed and ready for ritual. Two red lacquered bloodbowls were sitting on either side of its belly. Like most bloodwitch tools these bowls had an ill look. They’d been fashioned into scowling creatures. They stood on four short peg legs and the bulk of the bowl was their stomach, which flared out into an oblong, shallow pan. One of them was packed flat to the brim with a red, waxy substance that Elrahet called solrashesh. She said it was the pulped flesh of an ancient king, mixed with lyme and bonepowder. 
These two bowls came with oval lids, and on the top of each lid was a knob, and these knobs were sculpted into the shape of human heads. Flayed human heads. Bug eyed and teeth gnashing. Seb thought that they might, if the right words were uttered, come alive and start nipping at his ankles. It was rumored that they had auras as vibrant as living things, a darkly red aura, almost black, some might say cursed. But they were sacred things. Elrahet proclaimed them righteous things. She used them to wield the Spark of life, to heal, and to pull the magic out of stomachs. Evidently Elrahet had been about to do just that, pull the magic out of the lizard, when Gugi had come and plopped a dead young man right beside it.
The sight of the boy had deeply disturbed Elrahet. She knew immediately, as Gugi knew, that this was Mandrameen, the son of Salavan Saran, and Salavan was Shagota’s Chancellor of Minerals, and Chancellor of Minerals was the man who’d given the Ayramun the tip that a great bounty would soon be rumbling down Scuttle Road.
 Elrahet probed Mandrameen’s naked body for a sign what had gone wrong. She picked through Mandri’s mop of hair like a mother looking for lice. checked his skull for any fractures or . She wiggled his head to make sure his neck was . Once violence was ruled right out, she checked for signs of the occult. She squeezed any birthmark in between her bony fingers as if to rub it off. She traced the outline of any abrasive welts that might reveal will of the earth. She made sure that all the hairline scratches were just bushmarks and not symbols spelling out a curse. All blood witches were driven by inscrutable purpose, and Elrahet especially so, but wha. 
When Elrahet realized Seb was near, and she commanded him to describe exactly how he’d discovered the body. She probed his story with same intensity, asking for clarifications on this and that, but there wasn’t much for Seb to say. He had simply happened upon the boy. When it was clear she couldn’t wring anything out of Seb, Elrahet’s perpetual sneer got a little deeper, a little more. Seb felt whenever she was dealing with him, she was sneering with effort.
If the body disturbed Moto, he did not show it. Not much disturbed Moto. His handsome face rarely deviated from a look of smug disinterest. Seb thought that Moto was too good looking to be an Ayramun, and too fastidious. Or maybe he was just too well-kept. He was the only one to keep his dress clean and clever. He wore a long, burnt-orange tunic over a padded white shirt, and he kept the tunic tight at the waist with a long red-sash. Tied into that red sash was a brown scabbard. Inside that scabbard was long, thin, and elegantly curved sword that had a name. The sword’s hilt was capped in etched silver, it drew the eye, and the rest of the look complemented it; a pair of white trousers tucked into brown leather boots that held an impossible level of shine considering the desert clime. 
There were little silver metal buckles on his boots, his scabbard, and on the left shoulder of his tunic near the neck. Seb believed these buckles to be entirely decorative. The scabbard needed them, perhaps, but Seb had seen Moto slip out of those boots without unfastening them, and then slip right back in just as easy. Maybe the tunic’s buckles were functional too, but they could easily be a bit of threaded string instead. The choice of silver buckles was just that - a choice, something that set him apart. Decoration. All the other Ayramun looked like proper desert bandits. 
If Seb was in charge he wouldn’t have allowed it. It set Moto apart. Ruined the cohesion. Life in the Sand demands cohesion. Moto might be the best swordsman in the world, but that had no bearing on unity.
Even the way he sat annoyed Seb. Moto was there near the edge of the cliff, sitting on a rock with his elbow on one knee, hunched over, eye glued to the rock crystal lens, and he kept his other leg stretched out like he was. It was like he didn’t that Seb could come up right behind him and push him off the cliff. Seb could end him right there. For all Moto’s flair and, Seb could end him here. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. Could do it while Moto slept. While he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.
“You want to take a look?” he asked. Seb was practically breathing down his neck.
“No.”
“You mind shuffling back? You smell.”
“Sorry.”
Elrahet snapped, “I told you to take care of it.”
Seb said, “It’s hot.”
“What does that matter?”
“I get to smelling when I’m in the sun like this.”


She leaned down again to spy the distant caravan through her scope. From this perch high in the strata of a sandstone cliff, she could pick out riders. Her eyes were still sharp. She could even count their number, all the way back to the rear of their column. 
“There’s seventy-two of them,” she said. “And there’s something unnatural as well. I don’t like this.”
“We’ve not had a lick of blood for two weeks.”
“Be quiet. What are you even doing here. Go away.”
Moto said, “What do you mean ‘there’s something unnatural’?”
Moto’s eyes were sharp as any, but without aid of a scope he could only make out the dust cloud the quarry was kicking up - it billowed high into the air. It shone bright as the early morning light picked it out against the darker hues of the fleeing night. 
“There’s an odd fix about them.” Elrahet said.
“An odd fix? You’ve counted seventy-two. That’s exactly how many Salavan said there’d be. This is the right time and place.”
“I don’t exactly trust salavan considering his boy has shown up dead on the road. But even without that, something is off.”
Moto kept silent to give Elrahet time to study the caravan. It would be stupid to ignore the mood of a woman whose misgivings had saved them time and time again.
“It’s the way they ride,” Elrahet concluded. She moved aside to let Moto peer through the scope. “Have you ever seen a caravan guard ride three by three like that?” she asked. 
Moto bent down on one knee and put his eye to the rock crystal lens. The wagons and their guard quickly came into focus.
“I have, but not out here,” he replied. 
Elrahet repeated her stance. “I don’t think we should go for it.”
Moto shrugged her off and took a moment to absorb the details. 
There were eight wagons, several more than the average for a gold train. The tight discipline of the riders made it easy to count their number: three by three as Elrahet had said. Hardly the ragged band of backwash from the Hrkkan conquests that passed for caravan hands in this part of the Sand. Ayram couldn’t make out any insignia or banners that might identify them as professional soldiers. Still, they were quite far out on the Junei plain, and the old rock lens was getting a little foggy. 
Moto compared what he saw to the lay of the ambush that Ayram had set up below. It was the most ideal spot to bushwhack such a heavily guarded merchant caravan. It was one of the few short and straight ravines through which a road actually passed. Its slopes were steep so his people up on the banks would be high enough to have a clean shot at the whole enemy column, provided the whole column could actually fit inside. It would be tight. There weren’t any  trees for cover, but there were plenty of boulders and prickly brown bushes. And those Ayramun that were no good with a bow were skilled at burrowing into the slopes.
Once in the ravine, the caravan could only go forward into the mountains, or back out into the sand. The way into the mountains was easy enough to manage with caltrops buried in the sand, and the road wasn’t wide enough for the wagons to turn around and beat a hasty retreat. Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Moto was not so sure. There was a good deal more of them than there were Ayramun. Three to one. And if they were Hrkkan Zikar’s… well he’d fought them before, and they had a way of wriggling out of your grip.
Moto said, “I’d take them for Hrkkan riders, but they’re wearing that woolen garb.”
Gugi suggested, “It could be that the they’ve been drilling common hands.”
“That could be.”
Elrahet said,“It could be that those really are  Hrkkan troops.”
“But they’re wrapped in white wool,” Moto said.
Seb felt compelled to chime in. “I’m wrapped in wool and I’m half-Hrk.”
“Really? Half-Hrk? When did that happen?”
“You can’t tell?”
“You used to be a Hrk,” Elrahet corrected.
Moto shook his head. “A Hrkkan officer does not drop his company’s colors for convenience. Even in the Sand.”
“The Sand makes converts of us all,” Elrahet said. 
Moto gave a subtle sigh. “The point of their armor, their colors, it isn’t about comfort,” he said. “For them it’s hardly even for protection. It’s about distinction. It’s a certain type of man that seeks out life in the Hrkkan cavalry, and once he gets the colors .” 
Out of everyone there on that cliff, Elrahet seemed the most apprehensive.“Still, they could be fighting men,” she said.
“They could be rabble, they could be Hrkkans,’ Moto said.
“Would it change your call?” Elrahet asked it as if she already knew the answer.
“If they are Hrkkans then they have skin in the game.”
“They won’t run when the killing starts,” Elrahet grumbled.
“And the way we’re set up -”
“This only works if they try to run.”
“It’s only completely safe if they run,” Moto corrected. 
“Then it’s decided,” Elrahet said. “It’s off.”
Moto gave Elrahet is sidelong glance of disbelief. “It’s not for you to call. We are Ayramun. Not Elrahetun.”
Moto took a moment once more to eye the caravan through Elrahet’s scope, trying to find some detail that might still swing his decision. 
The information they’d been given by Salavan was accurate - the caravan was here as predicted. And the Ayramun were eager, rested, and ready. The long shadows of the rising sun would keep them hidden until the most opportune moment. There was even the off chance that the witch’s magic might work. Most importantly, their secret way into and out of the ravine was a hidden crevasse which remained unknown to the Empire, and every day that Ayram delayed he risked its discovery. If found, this stretch of the Junei would be closed to him forever.
“Disciplined riders aren’t enough to call this off,” Moto decided, and handed the glass back to Elrahet. 
“But what of the boy?”
“What of him?”
“It was Salavan that told us there’d be gold train bumbling up this road. Now we find his son dead. Dead in the very spot where we lay our trap. Is that not enough to call this off?”
“Sure. It is strange. But eh. I don’t know.”
“It’s just a dead body,”Gugi said.
Elrahet gives Gugi a whack.
“If Ayram ever makes you Nearest, then you can speak up. Until then, shut it.”
“Perhaps he is right,” Moto said to Elrahet. “You looked the boy over. Found no foul play.”
“I found no sign of murder, yes. No sign of curses, yes. But the fact remains that the boy is dead. Freshly dead. ”
“Perhaps he crawled up in that bush himself. Perhaps he was looking for us. Trying to join up. Run away. You know Salavan doesn’t treat his family right.”
Seb saw the logic of it. The thought seemed right enough. Playing with it happened to trigger another explanation, an explanation that was more in line with the budding sense of paranoia.
He wasn’t one of Ayram’s Nearest, but he felt compelled to speak up. “If the boy was looking for us, maybe he was trying to warn us of something. Maybe Salavan sent him out here to warn us not to attack.”
Gugi’s face took an incredulous turn. “Why would Salavan send his own son to tell us that? And send him on foot? Without a horse? That would be a death sentence.”
Seb shrugged. He knew the idea was crazy, but the uneasy silence that followed showed that it had legs. Everyone’s face that the idea was stirring up fear. Elrahet’s face especially, because her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow would send it cracking into sharp relief.
There was a story written on the dead boy’s face that none of them could read. There simply weren’t enough clues. His skin was raw and peeling. Sun blistered. His lips were ashen and cracked. He bore the calm expression of death, careless and serene, the kind of rested ease that everyone desperately wants but aren’t willing to go that far to get. Set against the stress of the moment that ease was unnerving. For Seb it was annoying. Whatever the boy’s motivations were, he had failed miserably and now the Ayramun were bearing the cost. Let it never be said that once you’re dead you’re done stirring up inconvenience.
Elrahet gave a little huff and said, “There’s only one way to be sure of his purpose.”
That was her final word. It sent a shiver down Seb’s spine, because when a bloodwitch says ‘there’s only one way to be sure,’ that means blood is about to be spilled.
She took the two bloodbowls from beside the lizard and placed them next to the boy. Then she knelt down and pulled a thin needle-wing bone out from under her rags. She stabbed the tip of it down into the bloodbowl which held the sehsli, and in so doing filled the hollow bone with a measure of that blessed flesh. Then she used two fingers to pull the boy’s jaw open, and she leaned close to his mouth, muttered a warding spell, then began to probe his throat with the sharp tip of the wing bone. Once she found the precise spot with which to inject the seslsi, she jabbed down, pierced the decaying tissue, and then blew hard on the back of the bone, so hard that the force of her wind expelled the blessed flesh from out of the bone and into the boy.
 Elrahet sat back on her heels and from her voluminous rags she pulled out a half-moon knife, pulled its sharp edge in-between her fingers, and then asked for a volunteer. She was looking at Gugi and Seb.
“What do you need?” Gugi asked.
“The boy is dead, but his vessel remains intact. It needs a Spark. One of you must give it.”
Elrahet held Seb and then Gugi in her gaze. On each she lingered for a spell, holding them in turn so that she could project a sense of her confidence into them.
When neither of the two men stepped forward, Elrahet stressed the imperative word.
“Must,” she said. “You must give. This is a command. Em bestet buguul.”
Hearing this, both Seb and Gugi knelt where they stood. They touched their foreheads to the earth in supplication.
It was Gugi who spoke first. “Take my Spark and release me from the struggle.”
Seb snuck a sidelong glance at his brother. Gugi’s eyes were closed and he . 
Elhrahet stood and setpped over to Gugi. She knelt in front of him. She set her hand on the back of his head. “I will shepherd your Spark and I cherish willingness with which it was given. Now there’s not much time. Do we not have time, Moto?”
Moto looked again through the lens. “They are coming on quickly,” he said.
“So they are,” Elrahet said. Then she quoted a proverb favored by the Ayramun. “Even the turning of the world conspires against us.” She stroked the back of Gugi’s head. “I am afraid that we cannot stand on ceremony.”
Seb lifted his head and watched as Elrahet peeled a sliver of selshi from the contents of the snarling bloodbowl. She brought the selshi to her mouth, whispered a prayer, then placed the selshi on her tongue and swallowed.
The was the f 
Elrahet closed her eyes, opened her palms to the sky, and sucked air into her chest in short, powerful sips - five of them. She held the wind in her lungs for a moment, then exhaled slowly through pursed lips. She repeated this breathing ritual five times, and at the end of it she had achieved the heightened state of Culrisar, defined as such by the Bloodwitch creed: Nothing but the body and the means to move it. 
Seb wondered how it worked. A long time ago he’d had it explained to him. The I/Me/Mine which defined ‘Elrahet’ was gone, along with all thoughts and urges that obscure the present moment. This was necessary if one were to handle the Spark of the Divine. But it didn’t make sense to Seb. How could a Bloodwitch know what she was doing if she, herself, her desires, her sense of duty and the whole rolling ball of past events was dissolved away? If there is only present, wouldn’t she forget what she was doing? Wouldn’t she be incapable of carrying out a task such as this?
It did not make sense. Yet there she was, gripping the hilt of the half-moon knife with serious intent, and when Seb looked into the her eyes he saw only himself reflected. He did not doubt that the Culrisar was real - there it was. The definitive proof could be seen in the way her fingers, lumpy knuckled and wrecked with uncontrolled trembling, gained calm and strength and precision. It was her right hand which gripped the knife, and swing it around in the air, hand trembling eliminated. In fact her whole posture was , back straight and . She was a different person. Possessed, perhaps. 
Maybe the witch had become a vessel for a ghost. Witches never talked about ghosts, but they talked about fleshy vessels all the time, and vessels are for holding things. Holding the Spark, yes, but what else? If the witch had left her own body, then who, or what, was moving it?  It was a frightening thought, but it seemed to clarify the incongruity of Elrahet’s aged bones contorting about with such dexterity. And her face didn’t move. It did not frown or smile or grunt with the effort. She was like a minstrel’s marionette, limbs dancing as if weightless, face painted on. The thought Seb took from all this was that ghosts couldn’t control faces; if that was how it was, if there was ghost in Elrahet now, then ghosts couldn’t control faces. It was a bit . Made Seb proud. The little self-indulgence didn’t last long, for his focus was drawn to the sight of Elrahet setting the crest of the half-moon blade against the back of Gugi’s neck.
Elrahet spoke in a voice that was not her own. It was a younger woman’s, clear and fresh and brilliant. “Gugi Adeyongee,” she said. “Do not seek, for if your heart is kind you will be found.”
Then Elrahet put her thumb on the flat back of the half-moon blade and pressed down. She pressed the metal down with care and let up as soon the blade cleaved the skin in two. She then angled the blade cross-wise to that first cut and pressed down again. There was hardly any blood, just a two thin red lines, an ‘x’. It was so clean that it was as if she’d imprinted that crimson sigil on the surface of the skin with printing block instead of cutting the flesh open with a knife.
Elrahet took in a deep breath. When she exhaled she sucked in her stomach to push all the air out of lungs. As soon as she was sure that there was not a thimble of air within her, she bent over and put her lips to the wound she’d marked on Gugi’s neck. 
Then she breathed in his spark. 
It was quick, sharp inhale. Gugi gasped. His back spasmed and arched. His arms, his fingers, and his toes curled in towards his body as his muscles fought to keep the Spark’s threads from being yanked out. Though no one could see it, his face was pulled into a grimace of utter astonishment. 
This struggle did not last long. As quick as the tension had come, it left. And so Gugi’s prostrate form went limp and tipped over into the dirt.
A strange coldness washed over Seb. He knew that it was his brother’s heat being extinguished. That warm aura that he only noticed when they were huddled together against the chill of night was gone. Elrahet had taken it, she’d breathed it into her lungs. Gugi’s spark was in her lungs. Seb could see its soft orange flame flickering under her skin. Her whole neck was glowing, glowing so bright that Seb could see slivers of her spine’s shadow in her throat. Her cheeks were awash with light. Her pupils were bright as the sun.

            <Notes>He then clambered up the scree, both hands free, easily balancing Mandri’s light weight. In fact, Mandri felt so light that he thought this giant of a man could have thrown him up to the cliff’s edge with one arm. That would have been as comfortable.
When they came to the cliff face Ayram let out a shrill whistle, and a rope came tumbling down from above. Ayram twirled this scratchy rope around Mandri’s waist, deftly knotted it with his long, deft fingers, then tugged it tight, and then Mandri was off.
Mandri bounced along as the rope pulled him up the cliff face. Along the way caught sight of people down in the ravine. The sight of their little heads popping out from behind rocks and boulders, or the lip of the ravine on either side of the road, was shocking. They’d been there the whole time, and he’d walked right through the middle of them.</Notes>

            <Title>Ambush</Title>
            <Text>

The hours before an ambush were unbearable for Seb. Giddy anticipation always came to him too early, and this turned into an angry impatience when time dragged on. He knew this was all a symptom of elevated expectations, but he couldn’t help it, the future was coming, and it came with a certain surprise—death or glory.
By Seb’s logic, an ambush was always more of a surprise for him than it was for the poor sods he was ambushing because he had been thinking about the moment for days. His expectations were so built up that they’d become a solid edifice of dread. When the moment finally came and things played out differently—and they always did—the exhilaration of finding himself still alive was overwhelming. Meanwhile, a traveler in the Sand, especially a Hrkan traveler, they’re always expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland folk, so it’s no real surprise when outland folk materialize out of a dark valley shadow. To add to that, being surprised at being ambushed is necessarily a short-lived surprise. Sometimes it was permanent if an arrow implanted itself in the forehead, as that tends to fix the face into a look of permanent surprise. Semi-permanent, actually, because eventually the lizards will stroll in and strip the flesh from the skull and that look of surprise disappears into their bellies, then gets excreted out as that white uric acid.
This Junei ambush was different because the ambushee had a fighting chance. Seb was filled with dread before an ambush with the surest odds, so this one was killing him. The plan to take out the Mazyd and his Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or all the Ayramun would be killed. A Mazyd Lord could wipe out an entire army by himself. Even with him taken care of, there’d be the fifty-to-eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. 
Fifty-to-eighty.
Maybe ninety.
There were only thirty Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb’s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly five-to-one, misses to hits—depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. He didn’t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren’t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous.
He knew he wasn’t the only wracked with anxiety because of the rest of the Ayramun were quiet as the mute. The three lizard brothers never stopped joking around, and even they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren’t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they’d find humor in risking everyone’s discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn’t have helped it—even they were keeping low and moving slow, naught but skinny shadows being whipped along by Moto’s whistled calls. They behaved because the rumor was that a Mazyd’s eyesight was nearly as good as Moto’s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazyd’s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazyd truly was in their midst, then his superfine perception was something to worry about. Seb knew that they were close enough because he sneaked a peek over the lip of a ravine and could pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.
A whispered shout from behind him.
“Seb!”
It was Moto.
He flashed an irate at Seb, and Seb hissed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked down into the ravine. Moto was the only one allowed to peek over the hills and down into the plain. He was the only one allowed because he’d said he was the only one allowed. Seb , then joined the rest of the Ayramun as they weaved their own trails towards hiding places that they’d scouted out before hand.
It was a decent ravine, long and steep-sided. It bowed to the left, which was good, because it meant that Seb could loose his arrows from safe behind the bend. The arrows would go up and over and he could rapid fire without any fear of being spotted. Still, he didn’t think it was as good as springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper, like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills because he said that everyone expects to be ambushed inside a bottlenecked pass, and since the plan to take down the Mazyd hinged on the element of surprise, the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the dark and ominous gap in the mountains that was the Junei Pass.
Seb didn’t like the logic. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A ravine was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could just scramble up those ravine slopes and escape. It’d happened before. It was like kicking off the top of an ant hill—all of a sudden it’s a free-for-all in all directions. In the panicked confusion some poor gits would run right up to Seb’s own hiding spot. Most times that was fine, he’d pop out and gut them, but if that certain someone was a Hrkan skila, then close quarters with his prey was the last place Seb wanted to be.
All this stress was made worse by the look on Moto’s face. The man was peering through his lenses, and his squinting eye was so bugged out that he looked like he seen straight through the stomach of Solraheen. 
Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, “Shit.”
Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a bucktoothed, ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto’s adumbration too, and he asked the man, “What is it?”
Moto said, “They’re headed for a different route.”
“What?” Papi squeaked.
“We need to move.”
“They’re not coming through here?”
Moto ducked down from the lip of the ravine and tucked his lenses back in their bag and pocketed it. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, “They were going to come through here, but now they’re not.”
“They changed directions?”. Papi’s eyes were wide as the moon.
Moto didn’t answer. He was back to brooding.
Papi said, “If they changed direction, then you think they know we’re here?”
“We need to move,” Moto said again. “We need to hop over a few hills.”
Skinny Dill’s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. “We can’t move now!”, he said. “The Mazyd will see us.”
“We can move if we’re careful,” was Moto’s retort. He gestured behind him, , and said, “The caravan is still a ways out.”
Dill’s upper lip curled into a skeptical scoff. He said, sharply, “If you can see the Mazyd, the Mazyd can see you.”
Papi’s said, “We’ve should wait for Elrahet’s smoke.”
The rest of the thirty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the ravine, and every single one of them were staring up at Moto. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Dill’s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. A swell of anxiety washed through the ravine, bringing whispers and . Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and made to crawl up over the ravine.
“Papi’s right,” Seb called after him. “We wait for the fog to move.”
“Damn waiting for that old woman!” Moto blurted out. “If her shits not here by now, it’s not coming. We need to move.”
“What about Ayram?” Papi asked.
“Yeah,” said Dill. “Where’s Ayram?”
“Let Ayram worry about Ayram.”
Seb whistled to grab everyone’s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, Seb pointed up to the Hias mountains behind.
There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a grey, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there, and it was moving fast down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet’s magic was working.
The snooty look in Moto’s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb over, and Seb scurried up. Moto said to him, “The fog is going to make it hard to mirror that caravan. I’m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path they’re headed for. I’m putting you in charge until I get back.”
Seb nodded, but Dill overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over, then said, “You can’t do that. Only Ayram can put someone in charge.”
“I don’t care who’s in charge,” Moto said scornfully. “Don’t move from this ravine. Don’t even think about it.”
There wasn’t anything in Moto’s words for Dill to argue with, though the wild look in Dill’s eyes and the spidering veins on the sides of shaven head said he didn’t appreciate the tone. Dill was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was a short list: Ayram, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him, but Seb was sure that Dill had never countenanced the thought. He was certainly nowhere near a match for Moto, but Dill always had that wild look in his eyes, the same look Seb got when he got to thinking about serving Moto his comeuppance.
Moto was blissfully immune to it all. He didn’t care that Gil was shooting him the evil eye. He scuttled down the ravine bank, and at the bottom he dusted off the ass-chaps of his orange robe, did a glancing head-count to make sure all the Ayramun were paying attention, and then he broke his own enforced silence by saying, “My fellow foolhards—sit tight, I’ll be back soon.” He turned around and ran north around the bend and towards the plain. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out of his sleeve. Seb was chewing through his spines at a prodigious rate, such was the stress. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much-begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man up top, Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Dill would be the first to act up, because when Dill rambled back over to his boulder he was muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.
“Loosen up, Dill”, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal’s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Dill; a mocking shot at his self-importance. Dill sized up this affront with a puffed-up chest, and said, “Big show for a small woman. Better be careful, ‘cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I’m shooting.”
“Same goes for me,” said Forty, tongue half-in-cheek.
Seb interrupted them both a dismissive, “Pipe down, Sol’s sake.”
Forty gave Dill one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet’s mist bleed out of the mountains. 
In truth, the humidity had already reached them; it was invisible, but Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer a mere mist, congealing as it was into clouds of fog, and a fog organized by magick’d purpose was no mere fog, it’s vanguard mist spooled out into slender smoky tendrils that slid down into the hills like snakes. Some of them twirled up into the darkening sky and there the wind caught them, lifted them up higher, and splayed them out like fingers. A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” Papi said excitedly. Seb found himself agreeing. This was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If he could see it, then a Mazyd could see it too. He might see the unnatural forms, see how the fog had a mind of its own and he might get spooked. To make matters worse, high above the mountain peaks, near where Seb assumed Elrahet’s cave was nestled, there was an invisible fissure in the sky from which gray clouds were creeping out. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the Elrahet’s lizard.
It wasn’t long until the fog swallowed the Ayramun’s ravine completely. Visibility diminished to a point where Seb’s near-sighted eyes were on equal footing with everyone else. The iron mist was so thick that Seb could hardly see the bend in the ravine. He looked anyways, because he expected, at any moment, Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. This didn’t last long, for the raindrops swelled and in half-a-hand they were no longer prickling but splattering. There wasn’t any rain cover in the ravine.
“A bit much, isn’t it?” Papi said as he sheltered his bow with his short brown cape. “Don’t she know I can’t shoot good in the rain?”
“It’ll stop soon,” Seb said.
But it didn’t stop.
The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their limits. Streams poured down the banks of the ravine, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured it was more water in one short span than this stretch of the Sand had seen in a decade. It brought out the lizards—or rather pushed them out. A little grey bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb’s foot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn’t notice Seb’s heel come down on it’s head. 
Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.
“Might as well be swimming,” he said. “Damn this goddamn rain!”
The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.

CRACK-BOOM!

A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun. 
Papi looked like he’d shat himself. “Elrahet’s never conjured more than a mist!”, he squealed.
Mizm, a grey-scruffed old-timer stationed across the ravine grumbled out, “That old witch is gonna get us killed!”
“Where’s Moto?” came another ragged voice out the rain.
“Screw that,” said another. “Where’s Ayram?”
From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the ravine weren’t anything new, but the stress and seriousness was reaching new heights. If it weren’t for the rain dampening folk’s fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl. One man accused another of being a ‘pimpled frog-catcher’—a slur implying Hrkan whoredom—and 
Seb didn’t begrudge them their bellyaches. This whole situation was a raw deal. He wasn’t prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under his butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter his bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow’s flight because Seb had never done shot in such conditions. He knew enough to know that it was not good, and not good for an ambush where everything has to go right was downright bad.
Seb winced at the thought.
Downright bad?
Horrible that he should think that. 
Things weren’t bad. They weren’t good, either, but they weren’t bad.
This kind of thinking, this of breaking the into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, this was a symptom of expectations.
The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.
He closed his eyes and whispered a prayer to repress these bubbling expectations:
	
	A well without water is filled with purpose,
	An arrow in the dirt has hit its mark,
	There is no darkness below the surface,
	For every path is planned by the All-White Spark.

Seb drew his shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful, too—to what end, Seb wasn’t sure, but now that he was looking for purpose he could sense that a great and perhaps terrible purpose was brewing here. The Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny. And there were no bit-part players here, for poor and lousy as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all people were descendants of the first man and woman, meaning a thousand generations of toil had birthed them. A thousand generations of struggle lay behind each of these soggy, grumpy faces. At the dawn of creation they were made heirs to the All-White Spark. Each of them were necessary beings, godlike in their way, as all things are, for if but one of them was missing then things might not happen as they were supposed to happen. And that meant that each death that was coming would be necessary, too, Seb was sure of that, and he was sure that it would end in death, for the weather and mood was much too awry for unqualified optimism. Maybe not everyone would die, but some would. Maybe he, himself, would die, though he’d prefer it if his contribution to the Divine Plan involved living to a ripe old age.
Was that an expectation, ripe old age? If he was destined for an early grave, was it wrong to want to avoid it? Does right and wrong have anything to do with it?
His thoughts were pierced by the three-chirp alarm of the Red-Winged Tresset coming from around the bend. The ravine went silent, and all eyes peered into the mist.
Then came the sound of two running feet splashing in the thin ravine stream. 
Out the fog came Moto. 
He motioned for everyone to join him. All the Ayramun filtered down into the ravine’s belly and crowded around their temp? Leader, whose face was alight with excitement. He surveyed the dour faces around him . though this was tempered when he the soggy 
“What’s wrong with you people? We’re about to bag us a Mazyd and you look mad about it.”
Tizm, an old, buck-toothed wonder, kicked at the boot-swelling water, pointed to the sky and shouted, “The old witch has overdone it!”
A refrain of mixed agreement broke out. Some shushed, and others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, “People. Please.”
“Please my ass!” said Tizm. “This rain is gonna ruin everything.”
“The rain is perfect,” said Moto. “It’s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.”
“The Hrks?” asked Papi.
“Yes. It’s Hrks we’re hunting.”
The admission that it was Hrks, not Blackwood Jandri men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. “They’ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,” he said. “Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world.” Seb knew this was all a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he’d do this thing where his face smiled and his voice whined as if he were already pushing back against people’s doubts. “We’ve got to hurry,” he Moto.
Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, “What’s this about Hrks?”
Moto raised his voice above the rain. “The Minder and his Mazyd didn’t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.”
Seb as another round of and epithets broke out, followed by another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm the gathered with nothing but a pleading gesture. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.
Moto said, “The fact that it’s Hrks doesn’t change a damned thing.”
Dill, his bald head sticking up defiant in the rain, like a veiny, boiled egg, spoke up, saying, “All the better! I’d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man.” 
Moto said, “They’re bedded down like rabbits in that long, straight ravine.”
Moto’s words were a for Seb, and as with all revelations, the first step is doubt—it couldn’t be the same ravine where Gugi had found that dead body. He blurted out, “The one with all the karkle bushes?”
“They’ve all got karkle bushes in them.”
“The one we’re standing in don’t.”
“Look,” said Moto, “All we have to do is sneak up and shoot them. It’ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it’s raining hard, but you won’t need to feather a Hrk at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won’t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.”
“Where’s Ayram?” asked another.
 A quiver of frustration flashed in Moto’s face and he shot a quick, pleading look to the heavens before he said to those gathered, “This is happening whether you like it or not. And it’s happening now, before this rain and fog let up. Now let’s get moving.”
He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back north. After the briefest hesitation, big Dill marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were small, sad herd of outland folk, a jumble of soggy wool and tired feet splashing in the building stream.
Seb kept to the back as they climbed up and out of the ravine and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with suspicion, for Providence was at work in that mist. Unlike the Providence that people pray for and expect, this Providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. He’d once heard a priest say that while Gods provided the good, they also had to make room for it by taking things away. Removidence is what it was—that’s what Seb called it. Or Destructidence. There wasn’t an established word for it, which in itself was a telling sign of the times, for it showed that people only cared about their relationship with the divine when they got something good out of the deal. The Ayramun were no different.
When Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe, it wasn’t to share in the . The skinny man’s face was agog with fear.
Seb asked him, “What do you want?”
“Ya know where we headed, right?”
“I do.”
“It’s that cursed ravine, the one where I found that dead body.”
“I know.”
“You should say somethin’ to the others.”
“Why not you?”
“I don’t ever say shit so no one’s gonna listen to me.”
Seb chuckled and said, “They won’t listen to me either.”
“They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people gonna die if we get down in it.”
“I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it.”
“Yeah, but I was just sayin’ shit. What do I know about curses? For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.”
Seb said, “Are you tryin’ to get out of payin’ me my burgeons?”
Gugi’s face at the thought that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse’s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the of a sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.
Moto , voice low, he asked, “You the two that scouted out this ravine, right?”
Gugi and Seb both nodded.
“Any thing we should know about it?”
Gugi was quick to respond, saying, “Other than it’s cursed and we shouldn’t be here, no.”
“Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?”
Seb said, “That’s the ravine where we found that dead body.”
“Okay, what I meant was, I need to know the lay of the land. I can’t see through this damned mist, so I don’t know if there’s an easy out for them up one of the slopes.”
Gugi was aghast that Moto had brushed off the word ‘curse’ so easily. He said, “Moto. I’m tellin’ you. That place is cursed. It’s gonna get us killed.”
“So what? If it’s cursed for us, it’s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they’re sitting in it.”
“Yeah, but we the ones who found the body! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us—Me!”
“Seb, is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might be too easy for them Hrks?”
“If they’re in that long, straight stretch, it’s mostly steep, but there is one little nook on the eastern side that’s like a natural stair.” 
“How wide?”
“Not that wide. It’s on the southern end.”
Moto paused to think, then said, “I want you two to go south cross to the other side of the ravine where it’s safe. Then work your way back and then set up where that stair is.”
“Just us two?” Gugi asked.
Moto turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not enthused to be at her brother’s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more upfront about it.
Moto said to her, “Get Dill and eight others to follow Seb and Gugi. You’re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we’re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. When I whistle, it starts.” 
Moteah snuck away, gathered up Dill and the nearest eight Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn’t about to take charge, so Seb took the initiative and led them all south towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a few-score yards away to his right. When they were far enough south that the walls of the ravine weren’t so steep, they made a safe and unseen crossing to the western side, and once there, they headed back north, keeping low and quiet, again giving the ravine a wide berth. Seb stopped when he found himself crouching in the very spot that he’d been standing in that morning when Gugi called out to him about something he’d found. He listened hard and could hear the contented snorts of wagon horses that had been expecting a scorching day.
Seb crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind him did likewise. He ambled over to the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine’s lip. From there he could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine’s stream, and if a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. He didn’t dare peek over the boulder to get the lay of the scene, but when he realized that there weren’t any Hrkan voices in the air, curiosity got the best of him. 
Seb steeled his nerves and peered over the boulder and down into the ravine. Right below him were two horses still hitched to a wagon, and behind them were two more horses and another wagon, and whatever was behind them was lost to the mist.
So far as Seb could tell, there was nothing in the wagons. Nothing lying around the ravine, either. Not one person in sight. Not one red-tufted, white shawled, black-bearded Hrkan skelsi was huddled up in that ravine.
Seb turned to his troupe behind him, and the confusion on his face must have been easy to read because Dill shot out an impatient snort and came scampering up to Seb’s rock. The man kept his cheek tucked against the rock’s hump as he peered around it.
Upon seeing the Hrkless ravine, his confusion surpassed Seb’s. Something about the way  a bald head fails to wrinkle up when the forehead gets . Bald as he was, he had that much more forehead to wrinkle up. He muttered a single word as his eyes searched for some sign of the Hrks: “What?”
Moteah joined the two men at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn’t show the slightest hint of surprise.
Dill asked her pointedly, “Where are the Hrks?”
“Why would I know?” Moteah answered.
Judging by the , Dill clearly didn’t believe her. Seb had his doubts as well, but he could never tell what Moteah was thinking because she never let her thoughts show. 
Dill said to her, “You should know because Moto’s the one who went scouting.”
“Do I look like Moto to you?”
“Yeah, you do,” said Dill. 
This was true. Moteah and Moto weren’t twins but they were near enough that everyone knew they were siblings at first sight. Dill emphasized this by saying, “If Moto sprouted tits I wouldn’t be able to keep you two apart.”
Moteah sneered, but Dill kept on going. “Actually, it’s the other way around,” he said. “Flat as you are, you’d be the one who’d have to sprout a chest.”
Moteah’s brow tightented, right back into that severe look of discontent she always wore. She looked like she could kill Dill without so much as a . Dill was, daring her to try. Seb intervened by pointing north, in the direction of the Junei Plain, and saying, “There’s a shallow overhang in the ravine down there. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.”
Dill asked, “But why would they leave their horses here?”
Seb took another quick peek at the horses to confirm his suspicion. There were rocks binding the wagon wheels in place. He said, “Them horses ain’t going nowhere.”
“Moto said we should wait for his signal,” Moteah said.
“Signal to do what?” Dill asked. “There’s no Hrks here, so what are we ambushing? The horses?”
Moteah sighed and said, “We wait for Moto to chase the Hrks our way, and when they come, we kill them.”
Seb thought he saw a flaw in the plan. “But Moto doesn’t know where we are, right?” He looked to Dill for confirmation, and Seb realized that he didn’t quite know what . “We need to let him know where we are.”
Dill nodded in agreement. “I’m going to whistle him.”
“That would be stupid,” said Moteah.
“And why’s that?”
“Because The Hrks might hear.”
“What Hrks?” Dill’s voice was getting louder with each exchange. Getting up above the sound of reason. “How can a Hrk hear a whistle if thy ain’t around to hear it?” he asked. And before Moteah could even her dismay, before even Seb could his amazement, Dill put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out an alarm, bright and sharp. The sound carried out through the sheets of rain and probably carried a quarter mile.
Down in the ravine, the horse’s ears swiveled as they lifted their heads from the rainwater stream to stare skeptically at Seb’s rock.
Nothing else happened.
The soft rain sprinkled down around, and the eerie mist was as placid and silent as ever. Seb supposed that this silence was a good sign, because if there were Hrks resting nearby they’d have been stirred up immediately.
Dill growled a curse under his breath and smacked the boulder with the side of his fist. “Horse cock,” he said. “This amateur shit is gonna get us killed!”
But his frustrations were allayed by the sight of movement on the other side of the ravine—to Seb’s eyes they were naught but dark shadows in the distant fog. Dill took them for Ayramun.
“See!” he exclaimed. “Problem solved. All it takes is a little bit of—” 
“Quiet!” Moteah snapped.
“What’s your ?”
As quickly as Dill had whistled, Moteah stood up, arced her bow, and loosed an arrow right at the other side of the ravine. 
A clean, dry,  gull-feather arrow with a down-spout nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah’s arrow disappeared into the mist without so much as a whine. A handclap later, and the arrow found its mark as one of the distant shadows yelped, then shuddered, then sank down to the ground.
Dill grabbed Moteah’s robe as she nocked another arrow, and before he could berate her for going and killing an Ayramun, a shout of alarm rang out across the way—not an Ayramun’s shout. This was loud and , and , and it was followed up by the Hrkan horn of war. That the horn’s bellow thrilled the air and made Seb’s .
BWEEEEEEEEoooooooooooo
At the horn’s urging, the shadows across the ravine all stood up, and came sprinting towards Seb’s rock. Five men came tumbled down into the ravine, and by the time they scrambled to their feet, ten more were jumping down, bearing flashes of the white tunic under their dark cloaks - the white tunics of the Hrkan skelsi.
Dill and began to 
Seb and Moteah joined him. 
Slaughtering these Hrk like, bursting out of the fog was long, thin beam of golden Mazyd fire shot out of the fog. It pierced right through Dill’s bald head, leaving a hole the size of an eyeball. Swiping, cut a swath of carnarge.

 Moteah turned to the and shouted, “RUN!”


  body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 



Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his throat began to glow.


An arrow came whistling, 
A swipe of burning Mazydfire swiped at the fog. Heads and limp bodies. Seb crouched tight. Plays dead.

Shadow of a giant.

Insert Mazyd and his Minder. Fake wooden hand, white.

Seb notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, arrow drop. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his Tresset-feathered arrow would trill with excitement when released, but wet as it was it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, impaled itself in the back of Hrkan Skelsi.
The man dropped to the ground.
A shout, and moved towards Seb.
Fear
“Stop! Stop, I said!”

Pointing at Seb. “You knew that man was there, didn’t you? We walked right by him. Why didn’t you kill him?”
“He was playing dead.”
The Minder’s heavy brow at this flat truth. He’d been expecting more, at least honor his authority by trying to lie. He looked at Seb, and then back to his Mazyd, and asked, “Did I tell you to spare all those who play dead?”
“No,” said the Mazyd.
“Did I give any order that could be construed as a grant of mercy to any of these people?”
“No.”
“No? I thought not. Obo, this is the third act of disobedience in as many days. And this one’s gotten one of Captain Trez’s men killed.”
A grey-bearded soldier, who Seb presumed to be Captain Trez, was standing behind the Minder with crossed arms and fire in his eyes.
The Minder said to his Mazyd, “I worry, Obo, that you have matured too quickly.”
The Mazyd , and said “I thought that—”, but his Minder slapped the words out of his mouth.
“Did I tell you to think?” the Minder. The answer was obvious in the disgust .
The Mazyd bowed his head and took a respectful knee. “I’m sorry,” he said.
 “I don’t accept your apology.” 
The Minder held up his and said, “Here. Someone hit him for me.”
Captain Trez took it and grabbed the rod and 
“Not the face, you dimwit. Hit him on the shoulder or something.”
The captain swung and brought the rod down hard on the Mazyd’s shoulder socket. The whole arm sunk down, went limp, clearly dislocated, but the Mazyd’s face was unperturbed. Seb cringed more than the Mazyd did.
The Captain stepped back to admire his handiwork, then said, “They don’t make Mazydai like they used to. Each new breed is more impudent than the last.”
“Yes, well, the guild aims for a balance between intelligence and docility. Just my luck that I was bonded to one that is neither intelligent nor amenable to instruction.”
The Mazyd in full prostration.
“I am truly sorry.”
“Oh, shut up. We’ve more to kill.”


Soldier steps in front of them, addressing the Minder.
“Lord Kinri!”
“Yes?” said the Minder.
“What should we do with the outlaw?” The man was pointing to Seb, who was rooted to his spot in fear. The Minder, amused, turned to Captain Trez and said, “I dare say your men are no better. Your man here can’t even kill a bandit without wondering if it’s the correct thing to do.”
“My man’s not dumb,” said the captain. “He’s only following orders—your orders. If you recall, you held them back.”
“My point, dear Trez, is that a little inference and initiative can go a long way.”
“If he were clever he’d know what I wanted done.”
“We Skelsi do not operate on assumptions of authority. Do we?”
“No sir!”
“Your men obey you out of self-interest. That’s the most reliable. Smart and self interested, that is the goal. We could accomplish so much more with these Mazyd if we didn’t have to keep so tight a leash.”
“I should say it’s not working.”
Walking, struggling with each step, as if laden with chains.
“What are you doing?”
Walk right by Seb.
“Stop!”
The Mazyd did not stop.
The Minder pulled himself up to his full height height, and shouted, “STOP!”
Every single muscle in the Mazyd’s body stopped midstep, as if a and frozen him still. Fell over, stiff as a board. Eyes blinking in their sockets.
The Skelsi hurried over and fetch him, and on the way, one of them picked up Seb.
“You’re losing your grip on the creature.”

            <Title>Lessons</Title>
            <Text>Morning came to Mandri like a brick. Not a hangover, it was the heavy lethargy of the deepest sleep. 
He sat up, stretched his arms, and found himself back in the original temple basement. How he’d gotten there, he did not know. The previous night was a feverish sleep, and he wondered if his journey with the god’s eye burgeon was but a frightful dream. And he couldn’t have dreamed up what those burgeons had made him see.
He closed his eyes and tried to remember.
There was some kind of geometric pattern, shimmering lines of immanence extending out from his eyes.
And then…
And then…
And then he realized that he was alone.
He opened his eyes again and saw that not a single Ayramun was present. Not even Obo was there, only the ashy coals of the fire, and the lingering smell of smoke.
Mandri startled to, jumped up, thinking he’d been left behind. His sleep crusted eyes were able to filter through the dim blue light of morning and see that the Ayramun’s packs were still there. He hadn’t been left behind, he’d been left out.
He looked around and saw that the hole in the wall that he and Seb had passed through in the night was indeed there. He figured that maybe the Ayramun had gone into it, to some secret chamber, but as he didn’t have a light to follow, he decided instead to climb the ladder and see what was going on outside.
He hoped they were up there having breakfast. 
He climbed up the ladder’s rungs and found that his legs were remarkably lively. Only a hint of the soreness that he’d been dreading.
Must have been the burgeons. He decided to ask Seb about it once he got the chance, and maybe ask how he’d ended up . Maybe it was best to pretend that he remembered everything, including walking back himself, because he didn’t want to give Seb the idea that he couldn’t handle those burgeons. He wanted to try them again.
When he pulled himself up onto the cobbled stone of the temple floor.
There was no altar or kneeling stone. Only that hole in the ground with the ladder. Maybe there was a dead desert father in a crypt down below. Before Mandri could wonder too long, he heard faint voices whispering the air.
He stepped out of the temple and onto the sandy dirt, and he saw, on top a hill to the west, the Ayramun. The were all there, standing with backs turned, facing the wrong way if they wanted to watch the rising sun.
Mandri scrambled up the hill to join them, and as soon ,
There appeared a heavy cloud in the distant west, which was black towards the horizon, but this cloud was a churning pillar, a super-cell the size of several mountains, and its upper reaches pierced the shadow of world’s edge and so that the sunlight lit it red against the fading of the night.
Mandri gasped at the awesome magnificence. Little westwind zephyrs tickled his skin, and this humbling awe he was faded into a prickling terror as he realized the storm was coming right for him. 
“Holy shit,” he muttered.
Seb was standing next to him, and he chuckled. “Yes, it’s quite a development, isn’t it?”
It was more than a development. It was the mythical Mukghal, the vengeful wind. It was a favorite subject for many a desert landscape painter. And though there were many, the images they made all came out looking the same - walls of sand in lurid purple, lit up by jagged spears of lightning. Twisting funnels creeping down towards the ground, in the foreground, a sympathetic figure, a human or a green, trembling tree. The point to put the audience there, to suggest the scale, because naturally, the meager frame of the canvas could not truly mimic the real thing.
Mandri always accepted that these painting had a certain appeal, but he also always suspected that the reason all of these paintings fit a certain style was because none of these artists had actually seen a Mukghal with their own eyes, and so they were just copying eachother. What Mandri saw before him now would stun the world if put down in paint.
But this was nature. It couldn’t be put down in paint. Even if it could, it’d still be missing the scale. The absurd scale. 
Obo was there up on that hill, sitting next to Seb. He was as taken by the sight of the Mukghal as everyone else.
“That is unnatural,” he said. Mandri looked at Obo and saw a seriousness in the Mazyd’s expression that he didn’t think was possible.
Seb hocked a wad of borcandi juice at Obo’s robes. He said, “Of course it’s natural. Everything that happens is natural.”
Obo was undeterred. “It’s coming from an impossible direction.”
Moto looked down at Obo, “What would you know about it?” he asked.
“I’ve read every book and scroll that accounts the weather in this part of the world, and every Mukghal for the past thousand years was born abreast the Gonigal Sea. They form when the high Gohal winds stop blowing - it’s like taking the lid off a pot of steaming water. And the Gonigal Sea is four days to the south. And that’s not to mention that Mukghals certainly don’t look like that.”
Moto was unimpressed. “Clearly, they do look like that.”
“Have you ever been caught in a Mukghal?” Obo asked him.
“No. Have you?”
“I have. And it wasn’t a solid wall of sand racing across the desert. The first thing I knew of it was when my own dust overtook me. Then it was a mist of sand, and as it rolled by I was swallowed up in red haze, and what’s more is that I survived it. If I’d been caught in a thing like that, then the whipping sand would have lashed the flesh from my bones.”
“All those books in Jeket, and I guess you don’t know shit.”
“Tell me, how should such a storm take form over mountains? I’d be interested to hear how you finesse this discrepency.”
It was Elrahet who answered. “It formed in the west because it’s not a Mukghal.”
Moto looked at the witch with bewildered eyes, and asked, “It’s not?”
“It’s not,” Elrahet grumbled, and then she turned her back on the storm and everyone else and began to waddle down the hill.
“What is it?” Moto asked, but she didn’t deign to answer.
Moto turned to Ayram.
“What is it?” he asked.
Ayram, who’d been brooding at the sight of the great storm, grunted, then said, “If Elrahet knows, and no one else does, then it’s probably got to do with the blood-ripe stomachs.”
“What are we going to do?” Moteah asked.
Seb said, “We can’t possibly travel with that storm on our heels.”
Ayram gave Seb annoyed tsk, despite the fact that he agreed.
“We’ll stay down in the hole and pray these hills don’t get swallowed up by sand.”
“That would throw off our timing. Hrks might reach the before us.”
“They might.”
Purl said, “We could always try the paths under the earth.”
Elrahet, who had made it down to the bottom of the hill, heard what Purl said, and shouted back, “No tunnels!”
Seb said, “There’s got to be another way.”
“We could try for the Kari plain,” said Moto.
Ayram shook his head and stroked his beard.
“Could try the Goree Pass,” said Seb.
“The Goree Pass…” Ayram muttered, his fingers twirling the tips of his beard like they were weaving a fresh idea. 
“The Goree will never work,” said Moto.
“It could work.” said Seb. Mandri waited for the grungy man to expound upon his argument, but Seb just stood there and looked at Ayram like a dog waiting to be fed.
Moto said, “If those demon children can track the Mazyd from anywhere, then they’ll sense his coming and be at the Goree Pass long before we get there.” 
Ayram was now clawing at his beard. Mandri was amazed at how the hairs sprung back into that bread-loaf shape.
“Maybe they won’t,” Ayram said.
“Why wouldn’t they?”
“If this storm curves north once it passes, then it’ll get in their way.”
“What if it doesn’t curve north?”
“Then we’ll have to think of something else.”
With that, Ayram turned and side-step-shuffled down the hill, and Moto stamped after him like a little brother.
Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed most unaffected by current events. She was sitting at the hill’s crest, side-legged, with one hand locked in support, and the other drawing shapes in the sand. She’d do a little doodle and then watch the wind whip it away.
Seb was watching the storm with a rapacious grin. It was odd , but that’s how it was, the man looked like he wanted to be inside that storm.
Purl was sitting next to Moteah, cross-legged, taking in the wind, squinting as she did, her brown, sun-kissed hair blowing past her shoulders to reveal the cutest little ear. Mandri thought she looked quite fine in her quiet contemplation. There were clearly thoughts running through her head, and that’s something that’s difficult to capture. Too often a portrait ends up making a person look like a block of painted wood or a Sparkless husk. Eyes end up belying nothing in particular, staring at the viewer with the blankness of a cat. To combat this, Mandri liked to give the sitter a clear and cogent thought, it didn’t have to be anything grand, something simple that he could will into the persons face so that they ended up looking like a bright and living thing. Simple things like, “I can’t wait to eat that tomato,” or, “” Some sitters didn’t need it, especially those who’d mastered the art of looking serious, as Purl had. Purl had mastered the art of looking serious, and gods, that was sexy as hell.
That last thought came to as a surprise. It was the first libidinous thought he’d had since he’d risen from the dead. Perhaps that meant the succor of salt that Moteah had snuck int his food was wearing off.
“Anyone else hungry?” Mandri asked.
“I’ve got some sticks in my bag,” said Moteah.
“Do you have anything green?”
“Green, like what?”
“I don’t know. Something pulled from the earth instead of backed.”
Seb winked and said, “I do.”
“
Seb grinned, scraggled beard, then took off for the temple and mandri made pursuit. 



Just before they were to cross the temple threshold, Moto blocked the entrance with his sword.
“Where are you two going?”
“Just going to snack.”
“Hold on, Mandri, come here.”
“Give me a minute, I’m going to get something to eat first.”
“No you’re not,” Moto said with stern that brooked no argument. Then pulled a Hrkan sword from its scabbard and threw it a Mandri’s feet. It impaled itself into the sand and swerved give.
“You’re not going to try and teach him, are you?”
“We’re going to need every arm we can get.”
“I think I’d make things harder for you all.”


Mazyd- “I want to see this.”
“Good, you could learn something too.”

You hrks. So driven by purpose, filled with the will of solraheen. Your men ran. Cowards.
They weren’t cowards, they were simply unprepared.
“Neither cowardice or bravery are desired in a soldier. They are both symptoms of unpreparedness. We want our soldiers to be prepared and confident.”
“Did you read that in a book?”
“I wrote it in a book.”
“Well it’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
“You can be as prepared as you can possibly be, but still face bad odds. Then it takes bravery.”
“Is that if you’re facing bad odds, then you’re unprepared.”
“You think life gives you a choice in the matter?”
“I do. 
“Alright, lesson number one, Mandri - don’t listen to the Mazyd.”


“Can’t get caught.”

Desert storm.
Where’d you guys go? Oh no where.
Blinking Tears of Schisol out of vision.

ENDS with Seb Dropping the Goree Pass hint.




That swing. You just swung. Why?

Yeah but when I paint, I make mistakes. Seems like I cant do that in a fight.




End training session with: The way a good army should be structured, is that the commander needs be prepared, and the soldiers need be brave, trust their commander. There is simply not enough time to train a soldier in everything.
Typical of old jandri battle tactics. That is why your empire fell. A commander’s job is prepare his troops for whatever it is they may be facing. A commander’s job is to remove all bravery and all cowardice from their men. Warfare, like all practices of men, is simply a matter of execution.

The most valiant warrior is the the tax gatherer.

Almost everybody thinks that what they do is the most important thing in the world. The librarian thinks they’re guarding knowledge. A book on the shelf is The last stand against darkness. The comedian. The king thinks that if he did not exist, society would crumble. The leisure thinks that if they don’t enjoy life, then no one is. 



Bullo 
“So, you’ve got to get thinking about it. When you don’t have the time to work hard, you’ve got to work smart. So let’s get you thinking about it. First, you got to define your goal. What is your goal in a fight with blades?”
“Survive.”
“Ha! That’s right! Usually folk say, ‘stab him in the gut!’, but that discounts a perfectly viable strategy in any battle: simply run away.”
“I can do that.”
“And you should! Always run away, if you can. I’m not just saying that because you’re you. If you pulled a blade on me, I’d run away. If it came down to it, a fight between you and I, I’d kill you a hundred times out of a hundred, but I’d still prefer run away.” 
“Why?”
“Because swords are gods-damned sharp, Mandri. Doesn’t take much for a blade like that to find the bone. Doesn’t take much for rot to find the smallest wound, either.”
“But if you beat me a hundred times out of a hundred…”
“A hundred times out of a hundred, yes. But a thousand times? A hundred thousand? I’m sure you’d get lucky in a few of those. The point is that there’s always risk and it’s never worth taking if you can just run away. I’ve seen men as skilled as the caliphants of legend get stabbed in the belly by raw recruits. It happens. Happens more often when you’re getting long in the tooth. You understand, eh? You and me, we can’t get away with things we used to.”
“Well I don’t think I need a lessons in running away.”
Bullo chuckled.
“Sure. Sure. But in the event that you can’t run away, the goal has to become clearer than simply surviving.”
“Kill my enemy before he kills me.”
“So bloodthirsty. You could settle for incapacitate.”
“I suppose I could.”
“You must consider that many killing blows don’t kill quickly. There’s only a few reliable spots that will end a duel rightly. The heart,” He pounded his chest. “And the head.” He tapped his skull. “Of course you’ve got to consider armor in all this. It’s why Drekkan Socars wear breastplates and helmets and not much else. I’ve heard Drekkan Commissars say that the reason they don’t outfit their troops with more protection is because there’s not enough iron to go around, but really it’s because the Drekkan king can afford to lose a man so long as he takes an enemy down with him.”
“Thats inconsiderate if of the Drekkan king.”
“When a Drekkan soldier’s life gets cut down to minutes, he’s taught to spend them with reckless abandon, to do whatever he can to make sure the enemy whose blade is stuck in his belly goes down with him. You might not believe it, but they’ve got a whole discipline that teaches them how, if you get cut down this way or that, sword or spear, what’s the best thing to do to get ‘em back.” The Drekkans can afford to think like that. They can afford one-for-one trades.”
“But Jandrians are mostly known for slings and arrows. .”
“The Drekk can afford twenty-for-one trades. That, and they’ve got these things called shields…”
“Right.”
“Anyways, the point is, it’s much easier to incapacitate, and then you can do what you will…. Eventually, if we ever get there, you’ll learn enough that your goal will become to simply take what your opponent gives you. Every style and stance is presenting something as a target. But for now let’s just say our target is the sword arm. Generally speaking, its the closest part of the enemy to your blade, it is the enemy’s threat, and if struck down the threat is nullified.”
“There’s three parts to an arm: the shoulder, arm, and hand.” He tapped each part as he was wont to do.
“The hand is simple. It’s basically just a bundle tendons and bone. If it gets cut almost anywhere, prettymuch, then the hand goes to shit. If I can’t grip my sword, you’re going win.”
Mandri nodded. 
“The hard part about the hand is that its a small target that moves quickly. The shoulder however, is tied to the body’s core, and moves slowly. If I hack your shoulder here,” He patted the meat of Mandri shoulder, “You won’t drop your sword, but you won’t be able to raise it. You’ll still be able to stab with it, but swinging is out of the question. So remember that: hit the shoulder and he can still stab. Of course, if you get lucky and sever the nerve here, then the whole arm goes to shit.”
“I’d be lucky just to land a single blow.”
“Sure, sure. I know this is a lot to take in, but these things need to be rolling around in your brain. When the time comes, you’ll see, the mind has a way of digging these things up. Just remember the key things at least: Sword arm,” he patted his own right arm. “Close but fast,” he held up his hand. “Far but slow.” He held the shoulder.
“What about the rest of the arm?”
“The rest arm’s a funny thing. Before we get into it, we’ve got to touch a bit on the art of swordplay.”
“Nothing artful about killing.”
“When I say art, I mean a way of thinking about solving problems. It’ll be easier to compare it to something more familiar, like music. In music there is only one thing: the single note. In painting its a single brushstroke - you take this one thing, and you put a bunch of them together to form something a more complex. In swordplay it’s no different. The single thing is the pose. String them together and you’ve got movement. It’s much like dance.”
“No it isn’t. I’ve seen women dance, and I’ve seen men fight. One is a planned display of beauty, the other is nothing but a rude, chaotic frenzy until one gives a brusque heave and dies.”
“You wouldn’t judge the entire art of painting from a child’s scribblings, would you? No.”
“They were two lorldy princes.”
“You’re point?”	“Surely they were trained in your art from the womb.”
“If you ever find yourself in a suit of armor fighting similarly armored prince, then I’ll be sure to give you a lesson in that brutish form. In the meantime, you need to be thinking about it like this - thinking about the aspects of the form. In music there is melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, how loud or soft it is, and every single note of the composition affects all of these aspects simultaneously. That’s the important thing. If you want to compose a song, you need to be thinking about how the next note you place is going to affect not just the melody, but also the harmony, the rhythm, the texture, the loudness, and more. If you’re song sounds bad, and you don’t know the aspects of a note, you’re not going to be able to make your song much better. You might fiddle around for a little bit, but you won’t make much progress. You certainly won’t make anything interesting. That’s what this brand of thinking gives you: a framework to help you creatively solve unique problems.”
“I’m following.”
“Again, it’s the same with all art forms. You paint a painting, with every single brushstroke, you’re making a statement about color, about edge, value, and more. If you’re a painter you need to be aware of those aspects, because you’re going to make a bad painting, and you need you a way of thinking about it to fix it, or else you’re just fiddling around. It same in a fight. If you’re in a fight and you’re just fiddling around, being ‘rude and chaotic’ as you say, then you’re going to have a bad time.”
“That’s all well and good,” Mandri said, “but I am an old, old hat. ”
“Well let me finish now that I’ve gotten started.”
Mandri laughed. “Okay. Yes, continue.”
“So what are the component parts of a duel? It’s these: distance, timing, balance, momentum, risk, and most importantly, the opposition.”
“Indeed.”
“Every movement you make affects all of these things simultaneously. I take a step towards you, and I am changing the distance. I am playing with risk. I have shifted my center of balance. I am changing momentum because with this step, whatever actions come next must flow from it. After it all, perhaps during, you will react.”
“You can’t possibly be thinking about all these things. Not in the middle of a duel. There’s no time.”
“These and more. Really theres no end to the aspects of any art, because after all, it’s all made up. Just stick with the basics, drill them, and you’ll be competent enough to hold your own.”
“Can’t you just show me a few moves?”
“It’s an art, Mandri.”
“An art? I’m not trying to express myself here. My aim is to survive.”
“I know. But ‘a few moves’ aren’t going to keep you alive. You need to be able to react to whatever is going on. To do that you need to be able to solve novel problems. Creativity, Mandri. Creativity is what will keep you alive. To be creative, you need to be thinking critically about what it is you’re doing. That’s what art is, that is what fighting is; creative problem solving. You need to be thinking this way and so we’ll practice it. Now stand up.”







“ , you’ve won if you can bring your blade to a narrower angle than the opponent. Because that means you’ve got a quicker path to the belly. 
So, let’s just stand here , sword to sword. 
Pytele copies the pose
So here, we’re even. Now if I pull my sword to swing, you’re winning. One step and stab and I’m dead. If I take a step back, and out of your range, it doesn’t matter. This is the first beginner lesson: you start the swing out of range, finish it in range. If you’re going to give the opponent the angle advantage, then stay out of range. Like so
Alright, back to the the start. One way of gaining advantage might be to simply knock the opponents sword, like so:
My sword’s on the line, yours isn’t, so I’ve won. But theres an easy counter, I’m sure you can think of it. Yes, you can simply move the sword out of the way, but you’re moving the sword off the line. You’re giving it up without me hitting it. 
A practiced swordsman will know all the moves, all the tricks and traps. So if you run into one, your best bet is to simply maintain a safe distance. You should run, if the mood calls for it.
How do I know if my opponent is skilled?
Oh, you’ll know in an instant whether or not your opponent knows about the line, about distance. The number of men I’ve killed with their sword out to the side like this, mid swing, its absurd. It’s like they’ve got this thought that if they start their swing first, that means I’ve got to parry it. It doesn’t enter their minds that I could just take a step forward, close the distance myself, and then stab them.

But if enemy know about distance, about the line, you should probably run. Everyone else, the mere fact that you’re considering it means your much more likely to win. And this is the thing about fighting - about everything really - it’s more about knowledge and experience than your god-given physical tools. I’m one of the smallest in the Ayramun, but no one here would fight me.


Strength, agility, these only come into play in bouts of similar skill.

Keep your hand like the head of a hawk. Always pointed towards its prey. Nomatter how the body moves, keep it pointed towards the prey.

Stab instead of slash. Stab - less of the arm is exposed to the enemy than a slash. Stab requries less energy. Is easier to perform in tight formation as it limits possibility of wounding allies. A slash is more likely to be stopped by armor or bones, difficult to land a lethal blow. With a stab, a cut no deeper than 2 inchens can be lethal.
Stabbing saves a lot of force.

STAMINA - use heavier training tools to increase muscle growth. 

Daily practice vaulting on and off a horse.


The roar of sand in the air was tremendous, and every now and then a gust of wind would and blow through the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and as it did, it blew though the hole in flower as if it were the hole of a flute, and the sound was whistling whine that through the cave like the labored fits of a pregnant dog.
As the wind intensified, whine became a monotonous hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated further into the cave to get some sleep. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed. Obo couldn’t be bothered by anything, and Mandri was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the sandstorm’s fury. To him it was intoxicating, being so near to such an awesome power.
He asked Obo, “How long do you think I could last up there?”
“Exposed, you would die in minutes.”
Mandri walked over to the ladder and the moment he put his foot on the bottom rung, Obo asked, “You’re not trying to kill yourself, are you?”
“I want to see what it feels like. And I want to see it’s insides.”
“It will feel like torture, and it will look like nothing at all.”
Mandri continued on to climb, and when he got to the top, he stuck his hand up to test the air.
Sand blasted into his palm like a hundred bee stings.
“Agghh! God damn! That hurts.”
Obo laughed. “Told you so.”
Mandri climbed back down and sat near the fire, massaging his prickled hand. Red welts the size of pinpricks dotted it.
“I can’t believe they’re trying to kill Solraheen,” Mandri said. “If He could make this storm, then just imagine the kind of power He has.”
“Solraheen didn’t make this storm,” Obo said. “As I’m sure you are aware, He is incapacitated at the moment.”
“He might not have made this particular storm, but He made… you know… he made the structure for it. The possibility for it.”
“You think of him as a designer.”
“Yes, and it’s pure creativity, not the impression of creativityLike when artists work, we’re just moving things around. Like Moto was saying earlier about swordplay - his medium is movement. A painter just moves paint around. None of it is real creativity. What it is, is manipulation. But Solraheen, he created the wind, he created the sand, and from these, he created this storm. And why would anyone want to kill a being that could do that? That kind of creativity is the only thing that makes life worth living.” 
“Mandri, Solraheen is not a god.”
Mandri laughed. “What is he, then?”
“I’m quite sure, but by my definition, God is that which is necessary, and tell me, if Solraheen were a necessary being, then could he be killed?”
“I’m not going to answer that question, because I think the premise is a load of shit.”
Obo pressed on, and asked the question again. “Do you think Solraheen can be killed?”
“Look forget I asked. I don’t really care about what you believe.”
“Why not? If I were human, would you care then?”
“Probably not.”
“Everyone thinks that because I don’t have a Spark, that means I’m incapable of faith, or belief. But I do believe in something.”
&quot;What?&quot;
&quot;How?&quot;
‟OUch?”
“I believe that there exists a thing which lies outside the bounds of logic and reason, beyond understanding. You might call it the Demiurge, or the the Uncaused Cause, or God. I am not certain of it’s existence, but I believe that it is there, because I, too, am forced to confront the simple absurdity of existence.”
“You mean like when you close your eyes and think about how everything would make so much more sense if nothing existed at all?”
Obo nodded. “A pure sea of nothingness. A void, with no people, no earth, no Solraheen. Nothing sprouting up. No being.”
“Indulging that feeling is a bit childish, isn’t it?”
“Not at all.”
“I’m not going to get into it with you.”
Mandri got up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb’s pack, because a drop of God’s Eye would significantly improve the day, but of course Seb had probably expected this and brought his pack with him. So, Mandri was forced to lay there sober and watch the hole and listen to raging of the storm.
He could hear the sand scratching at the bricks.
He could hear excited whispers coming from the Ayramun.
An hour passed hour like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. The gusts were getting so strong that over the wind’s howl and the sizzle of the sand, there was the unmistakable grind of rock sliding atop rock.
Mandri looked to Obo, and who seemed unconcerned.
“The wind is lifting the dome,” Obo said.
“Should we be in here?” Mandri asked.
“I think we should be fine, but my forecasts have been wrong of late.”
Mandri stood up and backed away from the hole, and as he did, an especially forceful gust blew into the temple above, sending such a shrill whistle that stressed the acoustic , but only for , for it was silenced by the crashing of stone. 
A wisp of sand fell down, as if it were the dying breath of that great sand storm. 
The whistle and concomitant collapse had caused all the Ayramun to stir.
It was Ayram who first came bu.
Now that the howling wind was gone, the Ayramun filtered back into the pitted room.
Brooding Ayram kept him company. Ayram , as the storm ground down the rocks above. 
It took a full day for the storm to past, and in it’s dying wake, Ayram climbed up the ladder with his spud bar and punched a hole into the fallen dome. A stream of sand came pouring down, but Ayram persisted through it and banged his spudbar around, widening the whole, until a great avalanche dumped down.
Ayram’s firm grip kept him locked place, and once the pour had subsided, climbed up and out, then called his people to join him.
When Mandri emerged into the fresh desert air, he was stunned to find himself at the bottom of a conical pit. Ayram was standing out alone, trying to reckon the storms track.
He said it was headed north to northeast, and that they’d be making for the Goree Pass.





Look up how harmattan is formed.
 The camel becomes pregnant without the intervention of the male. 
The eyes become red, swelled and inflamed, the lips and skin parched and chapped, while sever pain the chest is invariably felt in consequence of the quantities of sand unavoidably inhaled. 
Burgeon Binge

It strips the air of moisture. Humiidity falls from 80 to 10 percent within hours. When the gale is in full cry, visibility is reduced to a few yards. Sand penetrates everything. Grit in food, grit in water (milky grit) , grit on the shets. If you close the windows, the temperature can climb steadily and reach 120, 125 degrees, when the air sears the lungs.


Sandstorms can be black as night or a lurid yellow or a bleak greay the color of old ash. They may hiss or roar, rumble like thunder; the air is oven hot and crackles with static and a hand run ofver a canvas tent pops and sparks like methane breath on a smoldering coal tip; nerve-ends tingle with electricity and firefly sparks jump and snap. The camles squat in teh sand, their backs to the wind, and close their long-lashed and double lidded eyes.
A static charge in the air. Everything sparks. Dog Cant be stroked without producing crackling sparks.

The reason the world is full of shitheads is because its impossible to do anything that doesn’t trample on someone else’s desires. So its either do nothing, or be a shithead.



The &quot;I am a violent animal&quot; and &quot;don't poke the violent animal!!&quot; talk always cracks me up because you know what happens when a violent animal shows up in a populated place? It gets killed. Not really a flattering metaphor. 

Never let the sun set on an unlanced boil.

Only time you worry about a soldier is when he stops bitchin.

Dont realize you have toenails until sand gets under them.

Fear bone- when it comes, you got to take a breath. You gotta breathe. You got to meet it on. Just don’t think.

My lord this is nothing but a game we play here. A game with wooden armies and paper flags. Tis but a block of wood you hold in your hand.

Its good he’s lashed to your back, because god knows your spine needs stiffening.

I can control whether or not these people get a window into my soul.

There is no cookie cutter for that timeline, when you wash out. But when you out of time, we all know it. So I just go hard until that point we know it. Sometimes, the reality is its got nothing to do with the person we talking about. Someties its about whats going on around you. Sometimes whats going on around you buys you time, sometimes it chews up your time. I think thats why we got to come with an edge every day, because thats something you don’t know. You aint completely in control of. It should keep you up at night.

I appreciate the will of men more than talent. Some of the guys id say you guys wil prolly laugh at. I appreciate ordinary men with regular skillsets that play the game at a high level.

The yougestguy is in the best position because he doesnot’ understand the gravity of the situation.</Notes>

We eventually succumb to time, it’s true, but time depends on us. We carry it in our muscles and genes, pass it on to the next set of time-factoring creatures, our brown-eyed daughters and jug-eared sons, or how would the world keep going. 

“This girl she be real quick.”
A murmur of assent.
“She be a running fool this girl.”
Heads bobbing above the comic books.
“Why did her mother go away?”“She be a addict. They un, you know, predictble.”
All street, these kids. No home or school. Edgar wanted to gethm in a room with a blackboard and then buzz their heads with spellinga nd Punctuation.

Egar knew about Ismael’s early career… He’d marked subway cars all over the city, his signature running on every line, and Edgar believed this was where he’d started having sex with men, in his teens, in the tunnels. She heard it in the spaces in his voice.


Simeon Biggs, Big Sims, was famous in the firm for his midbody girth. He was fat, bald and fifty five but also strong, with a neck and arms resembling rock maple. If he liked you enough he might trade chest thumps or invite you to race him around the block. 

And he told farish how people claimed to have been present at the game who were not and how some of them honestly insisted they were there because the event had sufficient seeping power to make thme think they had to be at the polo grounds that day or else how did they feel the thing so strongly in their skin.


She intended to meet her own end with senses intact, grasp it, knkow it finally, open herself to the mystery that others mistake for something freakish and unspeakable.

Sister grace believed the proof of god’s creativity eddied from the fact that you could not surmise the life, even remotely, of his humblest shut-in.

Out here the wind was a force that seized the mind. Yuo left the high school a quarter of a mile behind still hearing the big flag snapping and the halyard bating nautically on the pole and you powered your car into the wind and saw dust sweep across the road and you drove into a white sky feeling useless and dumb.

Buds place could have been something blown in from teh hills. It had a look of being depositied in a natural spree, with lumber warping in the yard and sprung open doors and an unfinished porch on cinter blocks - one of those so-low porches the house looks sunk in the sand.

Richard thought bud kept this dog basically for the juvenile thrill of having a chained beast that he could feed or starve according to his whim. 

If aetna ever had a clue to what he felt, what would she think? The fear this quiestion carried made him experience actual physical symptoms, a heat, a flush across his upper back, and a tightening at the throat. 

The only person he ever talked to from the heart was sue ann. She made him feel real, talking on the phone. She gave him the feeling he was taking shape as himself, coming into the shape he’’d always been inteded to take, the thing of who he really was. It was like filling out - did you ever feel things pouring out from the center of who you are and taking the shape of the intended person?

His gun was his father’s old .38. It did not have massive knockdown power and it did not shoot through concrete blocks or make fist-size holes in silhouette targets. It just killed people.

Astonished his heart.

He heard the rain dripping off the eaves and hitting the pie tin where he left food for a stray cat when he remembered.

She ran her hand through his fire-resistant hair (toupee).

…the more I looked at it the more I thought of jimmy. The towers and birdbaths and fountains and decorated posts and bright oddments and household colors, the green of 7-up bottles and blue milk of magnesia, all the vivid tile embedded in cement the whole complex of structures and gates and panels that were built, hand-built, by one man, alone, an immigrant from somewhere near naples, probably illiterate, who left his wife and family, or maybe they left him, I wasn’t sure, a man whose narrative is mostly blank spaces, date of birth uncertain, until he ends up spending thirty-three years building this thing out of steel rods and broken crockery and pebbles and seashells and soda bottles and wire mesh, all hand-mortared, three thousand sacks of sand and cement, and who spends these years with glass specks crusting his hands and arms and glass dust in his eyes as he hangs from a window-washer’s belt high on the towers, in torn overalls and a dusty fedora, face burnt brown, with lights strung on the radial spokes so he could work at night, maybe ninety feet up , and caruso on the gramophone below. 

Jimmy was an edge-seeker, a plamist, inferring the future out of his own lined flesh, but he looked at his hand one day, according to my little brother, and it was blank.

When sims laughed I saw his mouth cat’s cradled with filaments of gleaming cheese.

‘I thought terrible substances were dumped routinely in ldc’s”
An LDC, id just found out, was aless developed country in the language of banks and other global entities.

He sat across teh table, meat face and wide body, the jut underlip, the odd little unlobed ears, round and perfectly worked, the tiny mannered ears of a sprite child.

He had a hard grin that mocked whatever facile sentiments ou might be tempted to shelter in the name of your personal conspiracy credo. 

A man and woman walked across the lobby and I watched her carefully. Maybe it was the hip-sprung way she moved, high-assed and shiny, alert to surfaces, like a character in a b movie soaked in alimony and gin. 

I felt a flare of competition, a duress of the spirit that warns against the shame of losing, and I hurried to catch up.

A hole covered across much of the sloped bottom by an immense shimmering sheet, a polyethylene skin, silvery blue, that caught cloudmotion and rolled in the wind. 

Detwiler tilted his chin, marking the small measure of amusement hi might attach to this remark. He had the canny self-assurance of an industyr maverick, the outsider who tries to roil the works, japing every complacent rule of belief. And he looked remade, retooled, shaved head and bushy mustache, a guy in firm control, with a workout coach and a nice line of credit, in a black turtleneck jersey and designer jeans. 


A bird flew across the width of the crater, a finch or wren, moving with the nervous fleetness, the urgency of sundown.

He talked in his talk-show way, focused, practiced, generically intimate. He was a waste hustler, looking for book deals and documentary films, and I dont think he cared whether we were two people listening or half a million. 

Choppers… and they passed above us with a rackety blast that sucked the air out of the car and left us limp and ducking.

Ruddy white-haired guys with big ravaged noses, patriarchs of this or that industry. 

I gleaned from the boys what it must be like to grow into this kind of world, how commensurate to one’s expectation of what is due - the world that moeny makes and erect bearing and clear speech and college emblems on the beds and a sense of birthright and usable history. 

She sat on the shady side of the table, hands flashing when she reached for her coffe, and when the umbrella edge lifted in the breeze her face caught contour and warmth.

It was possible she wasn’t here for sex at all but only back matter, the kind of supplementary material that fills out an experience.

I’m not saying sex is our divinity. Please. Only that sex is the one secret we have that approximates an exalted state and that we share, two people share wordlessly more or less equally more or less, and this make it powerful and mysterious and worth sheltering.

Sex is what you can get. For some people, most people, its the most important thing they can get without being born rich or smart or stealing. This is what life can give you thats equal to others or better, even , that you don’t hae to go to college six years to get. And its not religion and its not science but you can explore it and learn things about yourself. 

Dont look at me so closely. Youre looking too closely.
How else do I know you?
You don’t know me. You don’t want to know me. We’re in the desert here.
Dont look at me
Who will I look at?
I didn’t come to this freaking outback to be analyzed.

Head erect, her mouth pursed in mock self-rigteousness.

I felt a breath of estrangement in the room and thought she might be a voyeur of her own experience, living at an angle to the moment, and recording in some state of future-mind. But then she pulled me down, snatched a fistful o fhair and pulled me into a kiss, and there was a heat in her, a hungry pulse that resembled a gust of being. We were patched together grappling and straining, not enough hands to grab each other, not nearly sufficient body to press upon the other, we wanted more hold and grip, a sort of mapped contact, bodies matching point for point, and I raised up and saw how small she looked, naked nad abed, how completely different from teh woman of the movietone aura in the hotel lobby. She was near to real earth now, the sex-grubbed dug-up self, and I felt close to her and thought I knew her finally even as she shut her eyes to hide herself.
I said her name.
We were hollowed out loike scooped guava when it was over. Our limbs ached and I had a desert thirst and we’d killed the morning off. 
… she fell into pretend sleep, leave-me-alone sleep, but I eased onto the blanket and pressed myself upon her, breathing the soft heat of her brow and tasting at the end of my tongue the smallest beadlets of fever. I heard room maids talking in the hall and knew we were gone from each other’s life, already and forever.

He went through the process in lushest detail, stroking certain words, drawing them out, oozy, swampy, semisolid, thick,slick,sludge.

What gusto he managed to salvage from our punishing run, eyes wide and voice strong - he made it sound like a personal attack.
Outside he caught a wiff in the air, a faint sort of stinkhole odor, barely detectable but odd in its emotional force. 
Maybe there was a shift in the breeze. He noted the smell again and found it moved him in strange ways, one of those smells that traces back through memory, musty and earthy in this particular case, and he felt an unaccountable urge to follow it to its source.

The shock, the power of an ordinary life. It is a thing you could not invent with banks of computers in a dust-free room.

“Pick up your feet when you walk. You’re a healthy man who tries to look sick.”

She did not quibble or carp, she spoke ently to him, she was better than he deserved, writing postcards when she went back home to visit - imagine getting a postcard from your wife.

Then she stopped dead, going rigid in her brilliant slicker.

She said the word with a grimace of susicion, the response reserved for certain smells, clutching up the mouth and nose, beading the eyes agianst the sight of criminal matter at the source.

He realized this was probably a normal part of every early marriage, smelling the other’s smell, getting it over and done with so you can move ahead with your lives, have children, buy a little house, remember everybody’s birthday, take a drive on the blue ridge parkway, get sick and die. But in this case the husband had to take extreme precautions because the odor was shameful, it was intense and deeply personal and seemed to say something awful about the bearer.


His BMs (bowel movements) grew steamier as they traveled up through eastern poland. They argued with workers in a stand-up bar, men drinking morning mugs of beer. They argued with a woman who did ticket prices on an abacus. He was surprised by the heat in the little room, the steamy aura he’d established there, it was heavy and humid, an air mass of sweltry stench - all that radiant energy from a single BM.
Lucky for him that eleanor went first every day. Because she shouldn’t have to confront this, an english girl with hair that’s nearly blond. He made sure she never passed a toilet he’d just used.

He grunted on the seat until all the elements issued - earth, air, fire and water. 
The deeper into communist country, the more foul his BMs.

Avram was a dedicated communist with a beetled brow and he spat little word-flecks of contempt at the u.s., the system is corrupt, we will eat you for lunch, you ar a what-do-you-call-it kind of culture, a mickey mouse culture, and that night marvin had to make an emergency visit to the hotel toilet, where he unleashed a firewall of chemical waste. The smell that surrounded him was infused with what, with geopolitics, and he waved a towel for five minutes and propped open the window, it kept closing, with a rolled up copy of pravda, he was still loking for baseball scores, and then he went and stood in their room and watched elanor sleep - she came from a gentle rural place and could easily perish from his reek.

It grated on marvin to hear these things from a man so sel-fassured who’s a total nobody, a little guy who pushed upward when he talked, with two false teeth made of stainless steel, he’s the shiniest applinance insight. 

And on his way back to western europe his system slowly returned to normal, branny BMs, healthful and mild.

Marvin do you plan to wear it?
She was talking about his toupee.
I need it for how I see myself.
He also needid it because it took the edge off his large ears and sorrowful marvin nose.


Twenty minutes later they walked along the street, umbrellas up, it was raining lightly, a few panhandlers about, a woman in a mohawk nd white makeup punching a doomsday leaflet into the belt buckle of marvin’s raincoat. Peace is coming - be prepared. Most of the shops were open despite the hour or because of the hour and they were almost all below street level so you peered over a guardrail to see what they were selling, role reversal rubber goods or Endangered fashions - jackets made from the skin of disappearing species.

They went to a hole-in-the-wall place, a lot of cracked plaster and roachy baseboards and a stock of arare recordings. 

A boy walked by in clothes so raggedy he could have been a ticker-tape parade.

There was a place called the conspriacy theory cafe. Shelves filled with books, film reels, sound tapes, official government reports in blue binders. Elanor wanted to have a coffee and brows byt marvin waved the place off - a series of sterile exercises. He believed the well-springs were deeper and less detectable, deeper and shallower both, look at billboards and matchbooks, trademarks on products, birthmarks on bodies, look at the behaviour of your pets.

The largest shop was at street level, a dozen men standing around, furtive, in raincoats, looking at old copies of national geographic. These were used magazines, used and handled, lived-with, and the address labels were attached, machine-stamped and ink-smudged and skin-greasy, and printed on the labels were the names and addresses of real people out there in magazine america, and the men in raincoats stood by tables and bins and read the labels and leafed through the magazines, heads never lifting.
Marvin did not think these men were interested in photos of wolf packs on the tundra at sunset. It was something else they sought, a forgotten human murmur, maybe, a sense of families in little heartland houses with a spaniel flop-eared on the rug, a sense of snug innocence and the undiscovered world outside, the vast geographic. A pornography of nostalgia, maybe, or was it something else completely?
And was there a back room, because isn’t there always a back room, another splintering of desire, a little more refined and personalized, and in the back room weren’t the magazines cased in acetate folders, maybe these were rare issues or rare labels, or maybe the folders themselves were the fetish items here, dust-veneered, handled, nearly opaque some of them, a dullish sort of plastic with a faint odor and propohylactic feel, like condoms for rading matter, and maybe there’s another room where you need to whisper a password and this is the room with folders only, empty folders, ahandled a thousand times, and elanor was completely creeped out by this place, it was more than she’d bargained for, raincoated men with national geographics, furtively thumbing the labels.

Tommy had a smile so slight and fleeting it could only be photographed on film stock developed by nasa.


Odysseus honor is everything, thats why he kills all the suitors and the slaves. Shows he is not to be fucked with.

I’d known sims and glassic a long time and glassic, freckled freestyle brian, a man o fshambling charm, was the guy I talked to when I talked about something. I talked to big sims but maybe I talked to glassic more readily because he did not challenge me with his own experience, he did not narrow his eyes as sims did and fix me in his gaze.



Sims had a derisive smile, a fleer, and it grew meaner by the second.

Guy buys homerun baseball to “commemorate failure.” A relic of failure, not success. Love that.
“To commemorate failure. To have that moment in my hand when branca turned and watched the ball go into the stands - from him to me.”
“Even his name. Somber ralph Branca. Like a figure out of an old epic. Somber plodding Ralph slain in something something dusk.”
———MOVe this To SALAVAN AND PYETLE! - maybe have this be the introduction of the knife.
“What’s it like to have to live with one awful moment?”
“A moment in a game,” she sade.
“Forever plodding across the outfield grass on your way to the clubhouse.”
Sims was getting mad at us.
“I don’t think you fellows see the point.” The way he said fellows. “What loss? What failure are we talking about? Didn’t they all go home happy in the end? I mean branca - branca’s got the number thirteen on his license plate. He wants us to know he was the guy. Branca and thomson appear at soprts dinners all the time. They sing songs and tell jokes. Theyre the longst-running act in show business. You fellows miss the point.” Making us sound like scrubbed boys in preppy jackets. (Mandri) “Branca’s a hero. I mean Branca was given every chance to survive this gae and we all know why.”
A little pall fell across the table.
“Because he’s white,” Sims said. “Because the whole thing is white. Because you can survive and endure and prosper if they let you. BUt you have to be white before they let you.”
Glassic shifted in his chair.
Sims told the story of a pitcher named donnie moore who gave up a crusical home run in a plyoff game and ended up shooting his wife. Donnie moore was black and the player who hit the home run was black. And then he shot and killed hiimself. He shot his wife several times, nonfatally, and then shot himself. He took a dirt nap in his own laundry room, sims said. … Donnie moore was not allowed to outlive his failure. The fans gave him every grief and there weren’t any skits at the baseball dinners.

Farish sat in a thoughtful knot, arms and legs crossed, body twisted toward the window, yielding to the power of our differences.

Dark deni twill of the outer cloth.

Her skin was Camay-pure and her hair was dark and straight and she usually wore it short because short was easy. Her voice was shaped, it was deep and toned, sort of vowel round and erotic, particularly over the phone or in the bedroom dark, with brandy static in it or just hte slightest throat thing of night desire.

This is how brian relieves the pressure of being brian.

When Lainie had her baby, her girl, I felt a soft joy settle in my chest. Or a solace, maybe, an easing of some perennial clutch or grab, some taunt of malehood. All these women now, from my mother in her pale green room to this raw arrival kicking in mortal fret, all gathered near the chimneypiece. It was a kindness that the child should be a girl. I felt an expansive ease, an unthrobbing of some knot in my body. I watched her naked in her mother’s arms, swimming in a ribbon of light.

Marian leaned into me and laughed, watching the land surface expand around us. It was first light, a foil shimmer at desert’s edge. At three hundred feet we caught a mild westerly and drifted toward the eyelid slice of the sun. 

We leaned close, my arm around her, our thighs pressing, and we were rocked and whirled, although not turning - whirled within ourselves, blood-whirled into a quickened sense. I had my free hand around an iron bar, part of the rigid frme connecting the basket to the load cables, and I could feel the metal breathe in my fist.

Flipped the pages with a crispness that would have seemed short tempered to someone who didn’t know her habits.

How an idle thumb likes to worry the scuffed horsehide. You squeeze a baseball. You kind of juice it or milk it. The resistance of the packed material makes you want to press harder. Theres an equilibrium, an agreeable animal tension between the hard leather object and the sort of clawed hand ,veins stretching with the ffort. And the feel of raised seams cross the fingertips, cloth contours like road bumps under the knuckle joints - how the whorled cotton can be seen as a magnified thumbprint, a blowup of the convoluted ridges on the pad of your thumb. The ball was a deep sepia, veneered wit hdirt and turf and generational sweat - it was old, bunged up, it was bashed and tobacco- juiced and stained by natural processes and by the lives behind it, weather-spattered and charactered as a seafront house.

You used to have the same dimensions as the observable universe. Now you’re a lost speck.

Injured surprise - won an argument didn’t even know you were having.

His mind is in the throes of this and that. He ses the food inthe plate and has to remind himself what it’s there for.

Brian was shamed by other men’s obsessions. They exposed his own middling drift, the voice he heard, soft, faint and faraaway, that told him not to bother.


The swerve of her thigh lines hidden under her shirt.

He puts the plate in the sink when he’s finished and then decides to wash it and dry it and he does this fastidiously, plus untensils. He knows he ought to fix the drip in the faucet but we can save that for a day when there’s a little free time. He puts the plate in the cabinet, whisper soft.  
— this almost is purely scenesetting, even from delillo.

Ivie comes in and does not look at him. She has a way of not looking at him that ought to be studied by science. Thats how good she is at doing it, sweeping the room with her look but missing him completely - a thing science ought to investigate for military use.


A depth in her eyes that she dared her sons to interpret - th egnaw, the rankling pain that sits inside the good-natured telling. And the voice in its factual carry, vowels extended and bent a bit, a sound out of the old streets, the old demotic song gone to the near suburbs now, and a slight irish pitch teasing the piece from somewhere deep in childhood.


She got the italian without the family, the boy who just showed up, like a shadow off a wall. She didn’t mind that at first. She liked it. She didn’t want relatives turning up with a pastry in white boxes. She liked his slimness, his lack of attachments. But then she began to see what this meant. The only thing preserved in the man’s dark body was a kid in empty space, the shifty boy on the verge of using up his luck.

Every subject, ground down and sifted through, yielded a little nicky, or a version of the distant adult, or the adolescent half lout looking to hit someone. These were the terms of kinship.

He made dinner for them and they kept a fan going because the air conditioner seemed to be running at half strength.

Mercedes was heavy, disposed to gesture, swaing in the chair, hand-sweeping, but ably taking care of feeble eddie, the imposter, the aching and stiff-jointed and gasping man. The old eddie of the subways was a robust guy, selling tokens from a booth in that cinema dimness of bad air and sprocketing trains, immune to the h ell rattle of the express, and she tended him now with expert love, with knowledge and command, and when she got mad at something it made albert want to hide because he was a coward of blunt emotion, things met head-on and direct.

He had no idea how to cut hair. He’d done eddie’s hair a number of times but hadn’t worked out a method. He paused often to study the effect, snipping, stepping back. Mercedes did not stay around to watch. Working slowly, snipping. The idea was to get the hair off the guy’s head and onto the floor. Mercedes did not seem to think this was a thing she had to see.
— convert to ‘the idea is to get the guy’s blood out of his body and onto the ground.

Righteous eyes.
Biggest difference is you see in old people what they were’

He could know her, almost know her, feel her innocence through the music, know the girl again, the spinsterly twelve-year-old who walked behind her parents in the street, he could see her in the face of the somber older sister, she was almost there, the girl, in the pouches and moles and smoky hair.


He hadn’t realized she was still alive, sister edgar, how remarkable, the same blade face and bony hands, hurrying, a spare frame shaped by rustling garmets.

When klara left him it turned something loose, a rant, an unworded voice that incited feelings so varied and confused and bled-together, so resistant to separation and scrutiny that he felt helpless in its surge. It was a hindrance to living. It made him distrust the man he was supposed to be, soft-spoken, well-spoken, gently reflective. Oh that btich and how unworthy of him to think of her that way. 

A woman marooned in introversion.

Shake his muscles loose.

The old nun rose at dawn, feeling pain in every joint. She’d been rising at dawn since her days as a postulant, kneeling on hardwood floors to pray. First she raised the shade. That’s creation out there, little green apples and infectious disease. Then she knelt in the folds of the white nightgown, fabric endlessly laundered, beaten with swirled soap, left gristled and stiff. Sister alma edgar. And the body beneath, the spindly thing she carried through the world, chalk pale mostly, and speckled hands with high veins, and cropped hair that was fine and flaxy gray, and her bluesteel eyes- many a boy and girl of old saw thsoe peepers in their dreams.



Sister grace believed the proof of god’s creativity eddied from the fact that you could not surmise the life, even remotely, of his humblest shut—in.

And edgar thought of all the infants in limbo, unbaptized, babies in the seminether, and the nonbabies of abortion, a cosmic cloud of slushed fetuses floating in the rings of saturn, and babies born without immunes systems, bubble children raised by computer, and babies born addicted - she saw them all the time, three-pound newborns with crack habits who resembled something out of peasant folklore.

They saw a prostitue whose silicone breasts had leaked, ruptured and finally exploded one day, sending a polymer whiplash across the face of the man on top of her, and she was unemployed now, living in a room the size of a playpen.

They saw a man who’d cut his eyeball out of its socket because it contained a stanic symbol, a five-pointed star, and edgar talked to this one, he’d popped his eyeball from his head and then severed the connecting tendons with a knife.

That night she leaned over the washbasin in her room and cleaned a steel wool pad with disinfectant. Then she used the pad to scour a scrub rush, cleaning every bristle. But she hadn’t cleaned the original disinfectant in something stronger than disinfectant. She hadn’t done this because the regression was infinite. And the regression was infinite because it is called infinite regression. You see how fear spreads beyond the push extrusions of matter and into the elevated spaces where words play upon themselves.

Richard thought bud kept the this dog basically for the juvenile thrill of having a chained beast that he could feed or starve according to his whim.

It was empty distraction that forestalls the pain of ordinary talk.


“Not so you notice. Okay. You want to feel your correct age. Get yourself a wife. That’ll doit for you. It’s horrible but true. A wife is the only thing that can save guys like us. But they don’t make you feel any younger.’
Richard fidgeted happily in his corner. He liked the idea of being included in the femal salvation of wayward me.

If aetna ever had a clue to what he felt, what would she think? The fear this question carried made him experience actual physical symptoms, a heat, a flush across his upper back, and a tightening of the throat.
He thought of something else to say.
“Left-handers….

Because this was the only way to escape, to get out from under the pissant details of who he was.

He looked heavenward.



Mouth cat’s-cradled with the filaments of gleaming cheese.

Maybe it was the hip-sprung way she moved, high-assed and shiny, alert to surfaces, like a character in a B movie soaked in alimony and gin.

Manx is surprised by the super’s attitude, knocked a little off-balance. The super seems determined. Should be the landlord’s problem. Why run around doing detective workd? Let the landlord go into his pocket for replacements. Those pockets so deep the man’s knees get skinned by rattling change.
Manx needs a drink. He hurries up Amsterdam past a TV-radio store where a TV is flickering and half a dozen people are watching in the cold.


White noise

The conscientious suntans. The well-made faces and wry looks. They feel a sense of renewal, of communal recognition. The women crisp and alert, in diet trim, knowing people’s names. Their husbands content to measure out the time, distant but ungrudging, accomplished in parenthood, something about them suggesting massvie insurance coverage. This assembly of station wagons, as much as anythign they might do in the course of the year, more than formal liturgies or laws, tells the parents they are a collection fo the like-minded and the spirtually akin, a people, a nation.

Ample women do not plan such things. THey lack the guile for conspiracies of the body.

He’s looking to stare the man down, put the man in his place.

Head is naked and veined and papery. A head like a hatched egg that’s all veined out, and three kids race by, and a face so naked you think you’ve known him all your life, pants cuffed tight, and some kids race by.


That night, seconds after going to sleep, I seemed to fall through myself, a shallow heart-stopping plunge. Jarred awake, I stared into the dark, realizing I’d experienced the more or less normal muscular contraction known as the myoclonic jerk. Is this what it’s like, abrupt, peremptory? Shouldn’t death, I thought, be a swan dive, graceful, white-winged and smooth, leaving the  surface undisturbed?
Blue jeans tumbled in the dryer.






He’d like to see an alka-seltzer is what he’d like to see, sizzling down the length of a cold glass of water.

He paces himself to the crowd, feeling pulled along, feeling frankly happy to be among them, and theyre carrying food and chairs, webbed chairs for the bech that fold up light, and they have sleeping bags strapped to their backs, a dozen college boys with their hair clipped short, and they’re passing thermos bottles that smoke up when you screw off the lid, strong coffee to keep them awake and warm.
He sees fathers and sons standing around the fires to warm themselvse, masses of people if you could count them, and mounted police with horses breathing steam, and he feels a rare elation, a wanting-to-be-among-them, and he is pulled along a little slack -jawed because its a great thing to see, and they’re singing roaring warring songs, they’re back-and-forthing on the street with rough-and-tumble humor, all these ball fans striding toward the ticket lines at two or three in the morning or whatever the actual hour. Manx is wearing a watch that stopped running six weeks ago. This is a situation he will direct his attention to when his life gets back to being regular.

A wrought iron table that’s spored along its curved legs with oxide blight, and mabye those are old french roses climbing the chimney pot, a color called maiden’s blush, or a long terrace with a slate surface and birsch trees in copper tubs and the laughter of a dozen people sounding small and precious in the night, floating over the could soup toaward skylings and domes an d water tanks, or a hurry-up lunch, an old friend, beach chairs and takeout chinese and how the snapdragons smell buttery in the sun.

It was so humid some nights ou could not close your door. You had to shoulder your door closed. Bridges expanded and sidewalks cracked and there was garbage in the streets and you had to sort of talk to your door before it would close for you.

A loser’s bent frame. All head and hands.


And she tried to listen to the woman but could not concentrate because the name lit up her brain, one of those deep sheer flashes that take forty years to happen.

The old muled vowels


Longing on a large scale is what makes history. This is just a kid with a local yearning but he is part of an assembling crowd, anonymous thousands off the buses and trains, people in narrow columns tramping over the swing bridge above the river, and even if they are not a migration or a revolution, some vast shaking of the soul, they bring witht hem the body heat of a great city and their own small reveries and desperations, the unseen something that haunts the day—men in fedoras and sailors on shore leave, the stray tumble of their thoughts, going to a game.
The sky is low and gray, the roily gray of sliding surf.
He stands at the curbstone with the others. He is the youngest, at fourteen, and you know he’s flat broke by the dedgy leaning look he hangs on his body. He has never done this before and he doesn’t know any of the others and only two or three of them seem to know eachother but they can’t do this thing singly or in pairs so they have tfound one another by means of slidy looks that detect the fellow foolhard and here they stand, black kids and white kids up from the subways or off the local harlem streets, lean shadows, bandidos, fifteen in all, and according to topical legend maybe four will get through for every one that’s caught.
 They are waiting nervously for the ticket holders to clear the turnstiles, the last loose cluster of fans, the stragglers and loiterers. They watch the late arriving taxis from downtown and  the brilliantined men stepping dapper to the windows, policy bankers and supper club sweels and broadway hotshot, high aura’d, picking lint off their mo-hair sleeves. They stand at the curb and watch without seeming to look, wearing the sourish air of corner hangabouts. All the hubbub has died down, the pregame babble and swirl, vendors working the jammed sidewalks waving scorecards and pennants and calling out in ancient singsong, scraggy men hustling buttons and caps, all dispersed now, gone to their roomlest in the beatenstreets.
They are at the curbstone, waiting. Their eyes are going grim, sending out less light. Somebody takes his hadns out of his pockets. They are waiting and then they go, one of them goes, a mick who shouts Geronimo.
There are four turnstiles just beyond the pari of ticket booths. The youngest boy is also the scrawniest, Cotter Martin by name, scrawny tall in a polo shirt and dungarees and trying not to feel doom-struck— he’s located near the tail of the rush, running and shouting with the others. You shout because it makes you brave or you want to announce your recklessness. They have made their faces into scream masks, tight-eyed, with stretchable mouths, and they are running hard, trying to funnel themselves through the lanes between the booths, and they bump hips and elbows and keep the shout going. The faces of the ticket sellers hang behind the windows like onions on strings.
Cotter sees the first jumpers go over the bars. Two of them jostle in the  air and come down tiseted and asprawl. A ticket taker puts a headlock on one of them and his cap comes loose and skims down his back and he reaches for it with a blind swipe and at the same time—everything’s at the same time—he eyes the other hurdlers to keep from getting stepped on. They are running and hurdling. It’s a witless form of flight with bodies packed in close and the gate-crashing becoming real. They are jumping too soon or too late and hitting the posts and radial bars, doing cartoon….
The shout of the motley boys comes banging off the deep concrete.
….
..showing the cop a little finger-wag bye-bye.
He surprises himself this way every so often, doing some gaudy thing that whistles up out of unsuspected whim.
He runs up a shadowed ramp and into a crossweave of girders and pillars and spilling light. He hears the crescendoing last chords of the national anthem and sees the great open horseshoe of the grandstand and that unfolding vision of the grass that always seems to mean he has stepped outside his life—the rubbed shine that sweeps and bends from the raked dirt of the infield out of the high green fences. It is the excitement of a revealed thing. He runs at quarter speed craning to see the rows of seats, looking for an inconspicuous wedcge behidn a pillar. He wacuts into an aisle in section 35 and walks down into the heat and smell of the massed fans, he walks into the smoke that hangs from the underside of the second deck, he hears the talk, he enters the deep buzz, he hears the warm-up pitches crack int o the catcher’s mitt, a series of reports that carry a comet’s tail of secondary sound.

In the radio boot hthey’re talking about the crowd. Looks like thirty-five thousand and how do you figure it. 
…the pennant race that has brought the city to a strangulated rapture, an end-shudder requiring a German loanword to put across the mingling of pleasure and dread and suspense, and when you think about the blood loyalty…

An iron mist. 

Iron skies.

Fiona hill on putin:
Don’t get caught up in responding and reacting to what the russians are doing.
Every time we pause, he makes a move. That’s what he’s known for. It’s his trademark. He’s a master of pre-emption. He has lots of contingencies. He tries to lay out as many options as possible. He’s not going to stay still while we move on into a whole host of negotiations, he’s going to keep on moving. He ups the ante. 


The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”
The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”
The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”
Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”
Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”
Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”
The obsession with a plot. “Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged.”
The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”
Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”
Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”
Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”
Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”
Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”
Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”</Text>

Would you mind telling us in your own words what you think it is? Thanks. 
A silly theory that people who refuse the truth made up. 
Ah, so zero understanding of it then. Just covering your ears and saying &quot;nah nah&quot; 
I understand truth.🤷🏼‍♂️ So tell me if we evolved from monkeys then they just magically had a human baby out of nowhere? 

The problem is when we did it to dogs, we also introduced a shit ton of health problems. Work animals which were mostly generated through accelerated selection have done fairly well; but most other domesticated breeds have numerous issues due to the genetic bottlenecks used to isolate the characteristics we were aiming for.
As a result, attempts to control human breeding are likely to introduce long-term problems we will have difficulty correcting for. However, germline genetic modification technology may be able to solve Haldane's dilemma, without requiring the genetic culling and inadvertent losses usually seen in planned breeding programs.
That said, our targets for germline modification at this point is mostly limited to clear-cut genetic conditions that are already quite rare in the population and could be substituted with the common variants resulting in minimal losses to genetic diversity and few ethical concerns; but the concept of introducing engineered novel variants or rare outliers to larger portions of the population is a bit more tricky.

            <Title>Cascading Conflict: The Science of Violence</Title>
            <Text>Integrating complexity science with the study of violence.
Night on bear mountain - emotion, psychology, fear. The ways that we think in terms of violence - blaming warmongering leaders and so on - vs. Looking at fundamental mathematical principles. Trying to suss out statistical regularities, that don’t have to do with that kind of emotion, psychology, or individual agency. Universal laws that move from the micro to the cellular, even further to genes, fundamental principles of energy and matter, all the way to the macro of complex organisms and even social systems. 

- Lewis Richardson spawned this thinking- the coastline paradox - fractals. Scale-free theories. Things that occur at different scales but still occur at regular patterns. Richardson, using very little data and rudimentary math, posited that the frequency and the severity of deadly quarrels of all kinds could follow these universal statistical patterns called power laws that could explain severity and duration. 

Evolutionary thinking: Most people are neo-darwinian in their thoughts about warfare and violence. That goes back to Darwin’s The Descent of Man - in that book darwin describes war as an agent of human evolution, that somehow conflict facilitated a series of transitions into the modern state - borrows from Hobbes Leviathan - primitive state of existence is one of hostility. Elaborated by Herbert Spencer in his Social Statics in 1851 - But really, Darwin’s primary debt was to Malthus - pop growth/distribution of scarce resources leads inevitably to conflict. 
1940s and 50s, game theory pops up. Formal study of conflict of interest. 1960s darwinian theory got integrated with game theory.  Bill Hamilton - 4-fold classification of social behavior - behavior is : cooperative, selfish, mutualistic, spiteful. 

How do you move from selfishness to a state of cooperation?

In the last decades, that question has been revised. Question is probably wrong. Cooperative behavior is as primitive as selfish behavior. Returning to the question of culture. *IF* cooperation is as fundamental as selfishness, what role does culture play? Complexity lens looks for analogies between human conflict and conflict in the immune system. Is conflict just like aging and death? Is conflict just a result of copy-error that doesn’t get repaired? Issues of algorithmic intelligence. Is warfare just an instance of rule-systems gone wrong. We’re miscalculating some solution that manifests as aggression. 

Conflict avalanches in Africa - 
Ethiopia and Sudan - great lakes area 

Analogies in bio systems. If you watch the way these conflict events appear across the map, they’re not appearing randomly, they’re related to one another in some way. If you were to watch the patterns cascade and grow and die away, the system that came to my mind was of the brain. If you look at neurons in the brain and you track their activity, florescent indicator, you see something similar - neurons firing generating cascades of activity. 

Something active - spatial temporal activity - if I were an outsider looking at this abstract data set, I would say that things that are close to one another are related in some way.  What does it mean for two events that occur at different parts in the continent to be related? What you get when join these events together in clusters are these avalanches that move around in space. They grow and die. This is not what we think of as a war or battle. By constructing these structures we see things that are evocative of things elsewhere.

Richardson: once you get to a certain scale (tens of millions of fatalities), events grow in a self-similar and regular way.

Question of resolution of data set - conflict is hard to measure.

Biology avalanches - theres something about collective dynamics that imposes macroscopic regularity. Neural avalanches, Earthquake distributions, fires, - something universal going on with complex structures that take place within space and time. 

Oliver Sax - talked at length about how lesions in the brain change behaviour. 
The two extremes of explanation: biological determinism, and collective constraints is human freedom, where responsibility matters. We can’t *ignore* the limbic system.

Policing works better than pacifying
ONe common observation in primate groups is a division of labor. Individuals are voted into a position of authority that gives them the right to intervene into conflict without retribution.  Infinite debate on who polices the policers, is moot, because in society, that position is assigned to you. 
Pacifying is: “I’m angry.” “Ok, calm down, it’s not worth it, that person’s a jerk, etc”
Policing: intervention into an ongoing conflict. A more diplomatic solution. That kind of intervention can be extremely efficient, You only need a very small number of individuals who do policing in a population - leads to two possible outcomes : utopian outcome- whole population experiences low levels of aggression. If policing fails, where third-party intervention doesn’t work out, you get a police state: where everyone is policing.
On the one hand, policing is more efficient that Pacifying (You don’t need many police). BUT if policing fails, then you have a proliferation of the policing role, which is what you don’t want. 
The key point to policing working, is that the police are voted for. Its an emergent power structure. If the policing is imposed, that’s when it tends to fail. Systems of distributed control internally generate hierarchy - the hierarchy is voted for - thats what makes it work.

Conflict, if it is small and contained, can be beneficial.
You will have differing sources of infromation depending on where you are in the system. At some point, these differing sources of infromation have to be resolved if you are going to make a decision in society. If you are getting different information from different parts of your visual field, how can you reconcile those different pieces of information in order to make a decision about what to do in that environment. That is a low-level behaviour.
Analogy: if you go to a society, people have diversity of experiences, and have different informtion. You have to decide how that is going to be resolved. To a certain extend, some kind of conflict is necessary to resolve that information. There are some systems where noise plays a functional role - What Conflict is? Doesn’t necessarily mean people are going out and fighting.  What does conflict look like in these different systems? Does it make sense to compare conflict of physical information to conflict of physical violence?

Conflict and creativity exist in some complicated relationship. 
Conflict and computation: Ongoing conflict, by virtue of extending sampling, allows you to arrive at a more accurate read on power disparities. Conflict gives you extra time to evaluate the true nature of things. E.G.  We fight, I win, but unclear if it was a fluke, so we fight again. 

Conflict - biological : relative fitness - misaligned interests - for a certain outcome, in order to achieve my goal, you would have to pay a cost, and in order for you to reach your goal, I would have to  pay a cost.
Conflict - violence : conflict that violates a social norm. 
Conflict - warfare : use of technology to achieve objective.
Plants and animals using venom - these are all weapons that look like war.

A bird flock requires only a few to change direction - only a few individuals can stoke the conflict. Thats import because, say, this bird only has local information, but maybe this bird is the only one that sees the hawk. The information that it recieves has to be able to propogate to the entire flock - where almost nobody else can see the hawk. That ability to transmit info over long scales can serve a functional role. 
So what about conflict? Something that we’re exploring. In the context of monkeys, we can push certain individuals into it. 
Policy - when you impose a certian way of making decisions - in a democratic system, it becomes different - there is some sort of weak point; when you have a system that poised at the divide, you have a kind of dictator. If a person at the fulcrum, they can dictate the outcome.  In terms of voting systems, there are various systems that indicitive of who these individuals are.
Alaskan supreme court. There is a dearth of evidence for this pivotal individual - judeges vote together.

“I saw it all.”
Obo smiles.
“Well?”
“I have no idea what just happened.”
“UUUUGH. How could you not? Did you not see it happen?”
“The witch is not what she seems.”
Sigh.  “I know.”
“And What is that?”
“Haven’t a clue.”
“We could ask. That’s some kind of demon, right?”
Elrahet like a feral cat.
Sighs. “I’ll leave you to it.” Walks away. “I’ll tell the others.”
Leaves.
“Hold on. Hoooold on, Buno. I’m expecting you to say a special something.”
Pauses. Sighs. “You were right.”
Obo is like, orgasmic.
“Uh, Obo—what was that?”
“That, my beloved Mandri, was Mazyd Buno.” Waiting mischievously for the next question. “For those of you who are confused, He and I are two of five Mazyds who have managed to hide some measure of autonomy from our Minders. I hatched a plan to win all of it. Dear Buno didn’t think it would work. And yet…would you like this back Purl?”
Drops the hand on the floor.
No control.
“You planned all of this?”
“Of course not. It was an absurd plan based on rumors, but lets just say I was desperate, and what great deed was done without great risk?”
“Our deal.”
“Our deal. Yes. Yes.”
“You will kill Solraheen?”
Smile of a whose been caught.
“Remains to be seen, doesn’t it?”
“We made a deal.”
“We did, but you see…I feel bad about this, I do. But you see, I could die tomorrow and I will have accomplished nothing. I’m not a selfish person, I don’t want the one spark. I want to free all of the Mazyd, and I don’t yet have the knowledge to do that. For that, I need you. You, Elrahet, are the most precious thing to me in all the world…This life you’ve given me, think of it as a tasting, as a proof of concept. I’m interested what you have to offer. What comes next, we can haggle over the details.”
“What’s next is you kill Solraheen.”
“This is a dilemma, isn’t it? I kill Solraheen for you, and you’ll have gotten what you want so you can decide not to honor your debt. Conversly, if you give me knoweldge of the spark, I have no compelling reason to help you. Having no higher authority to appeal to in case of a breach of contract, and no real reputations to maintain, we find ourselves at an impasse.”
“I’ve already done what asked you asked, and you changed your stance.”
“Precisely. How could you trust me?”
Moto, “There’s no point in arguing with him. He’s not going to do it.”
Elrahet - get him to understand why she wants solraheen dead.
“Like I said before.
Come, you want to know who I am? Come.
Say a good by to ayram.
Get my blade. Moto tries, Obo succeeds.
“I loosened it up.”
Mandri gets the burgeons.
They disappear down the hole.

That over there is chopper.
Chop!?
No! No chop. No chop.
Aw.
Don’t say the word chop around chopper. Unless you need something chopped. And if you need something chopped you better find him and let him do it or else he’ll get all fussy.

Not many of us left since yesterday.

The man walking in front of Mandri, the short and stout man who was carrying the ‘unconscious’ Mazyd Oro, his name was Hill. The rude, scraggly man walking behind Mandri, the one with the torch, his name was Bib, and according to Bib, these were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don’t bother with ‘why’, or ‘what is going on’, or ‘I can’t see where I’m going’, no, the only thing that mattered was that Hill was in front and Bib was behind and that was the way things were going to be - so stop talking. “Don’t make a peep”, Bib commanded. If Mandri did so much as breathe too loud for Bib’s comfort, well that was sufficient cause for an open handed smack on the back of the head.
Sound carried in that pitch-black tunnel so the going was hard for Mandri. All the while he was stifling groans because his once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods. They were so sore that it felt like his thigh muscles would rupture every time he bent his knees. Instead of striding through the dark like Bib wanted him to, Mandri shuffled through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor. That was hard to do because the tunnel was a dumping ground. There was a horde of trash piled all the way up the low ceiling, and though there was a narrow path through it, it was not a place for unshod feet. Scattered in the sand were picked-clean bones of small animals, splintered balkanut shells the size of skulls, curved clay shards of shattered jars, and all manner of organic waste, the worst of which were the cold and gooey lumps of muck that glistened when they welled up in between Mandri’s toes - Mandri wasn’t sure it was shit until Hill stepped in it, too.
“Godsdamned it! Bib, was this you?” Hill was pointing down at dark stain on the bottom of his hard leather boot.
“Course not,” Bib protested.
“Why can’t you shit in the hole like everyone else?” Hill asked.
“It wasn’t me!”
“It’s always you.”
“It’s always Grungy.”
Hill gave a frustrated sigh and said, “It’s always either you or Grungy, and Grungy’s dead, so that leaves you.”
“It wasn’t me.”
Hill glared over Mandri’s shoulder at the defiant Bib.
Bib shot right back, “And who’s the one putting all this trash in here, huh? You know there’s a pit for all this, too, but you’re too lazy, ain’t ya? Everyone is. You wanna take it out me? No. Get yourself together fore you come and pick on my habits.” 
Hill snorted and turned back towards the darkness and readjusted Oro’s dead weight on his shoulders. Then he set off once again, dragging his right foot in the dirt as he went so as to scrape the shit off it.
This tunnel was the most loathsome place that Mandri had ever been, but that didn’t mean it was the Underworld. On the surface it all fit, the grime, the stifling stench, the cramped quarters, the fact that there wasn’t one thing in this tunnel that was whole, yet with each step Mandri was becoming more and more certain that this wasn’t the Underworld. There was a semblance of organization with the way all the junk was pushed up against the walls to make a path, and that made it feel lived-in. When the trio left this narrow tunnel and came out into a larger one with a swept floor and high ceiling and clean  air, Mandri was sure - this was the regular old world. There’d be no dedicated trash pit in the Underworld. Either every surface would be covered in slop and refuse as an indictment of the waste of nations, or there’d be no trash at all because as disgusting as it is, trash is a sign of plenty.
No, Mandri was convinced, this was not the Underworld.
Did that mean that Mazyd Oro had been telling the whole truth? Mandri wasn’t convinced of that. He wasn’t ready to believe that Oro was a Mazydai. A Mazydai was a being of storied power, yet there Oro was, a meter ahead, all limp and cut-up and shoulder-slung like a sty-pig at a wet market. The torchlight would catch his pale skin, and his back was all torn up by whipping. Hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazydai down so low. It certainly wasn’t these two tawdry bandits that did it. Hill and Bib were as unimposing as sandland folk come, dirty and hungry looking, the kind of folk you feared because they were repulsive, not because they were fearsome.
Mandri snuck a look behind at Bib. Bib had his pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.
Bib sneered and shouted, “Get going!”
He kicked out at Mandri’s heels, as if that would help Mandri shuffle along faster.
Outside of the fact that an objective universe exists independent of his own mind, the only thing Mandri was completely sure of was that these two people had a leader, and that this leader had the strength to bring low a Mazydai and even conquer death. Whoever that person was, it was a man worth meeting. So Mandri steeled himself against the pain in his legs, rubbed his foot in the dirt to wipe the shit off it, and then did his best to keep up with Hill who was finding his way through the dark like he’d placed each shattered piece of pot himself. 
Eventually the going got smoother and the tunnel got even wider and it looked more like an outlaw hideaway. On each side there was a store of chopped lumber and then there were half-empty bags of grain. On from there they came to a kind of barracks -  flat surface was crowded with empty cots and  , even charcoal markings on the walls, Then this dark passage emptied out into a bigger one, where the ceiling was twice Mandri’s height. At the end of this larger tunnel, some fifty meters away, the tunnel gave way to the blinding light of day. Mandri’s eyes were so accustomed to the dark that one quick glance at this spot of sunlight was enough to imprint a white circle into his retina, so that no matter where he looked, there it was, a white blot obscuring everything.
Mandri stopped in his tracks out of instinct and tried to blink out the blindness. This sudden stop caused Bib to bump into Mandri’s back, and for Bib, that was unacceptable.
“Whore’s breath, boy! You’re a pokey ole tacko, ain’t ya?!”
Bib gave Mandri a hard shove that sent Mandri sprawling right into Hill’s legs, sending them both tumbling to the ground. Mazyd Oro, who’d been content to ride Hill’s shoulder, had his unconscious ruse upset by the sudden lurch. He yelped and went tumbling along with the others, splaying his elbows out to brace his fall, careful to keep his bandages out of the dirt.
Hill waddled back to his feet and then turned towards Bib and said in the most matter-of-fact tone, “Bib, you are a got-damned idiot.”
Bib brandished the torch towards him in a state of alarm. “Hill! He’s awake! The Mazyd’s awake!”
Hill looked down and there at his feet was Mandri grimacing, clutching his wrist against his stomach as he’d jammed it against an up-jut of rock. 
Mazyd Oro wasn’t there.
Hill spun around towards the entrance, expecting to see, but no one was there.
Then he heard a thud from behind and Bib give a yelp.
When Hill spun back around he caught a glimpse of a naked, pale figure sprinting into the black depths of the cave with exceptional agility, leaping from rock to rock.
“Aw, Shit!” Hill exclaimed. “Shit! Shit! Shit!”
Hill drew a short sword that was hidden under his cloak and his took off into the darkness after Oro, shouting orders to Bib as he went. “Stay here and go get Ayram!”
Bib stood and stared in disbelief into the darkness. When his wits returned to him, he turned around and took off towards the cave exit. He got halfway when his wits fully returned to him. He sprinted back towards Mandri and ordered him to get up in a tone that was as serious as it was urgent, but Mandri did not move.
“I said, get up!”
“Piss off!” Mandri retorted through clenched teeth. 
Bib let out a little roar of frustration, then reached down and grabbed Mandri by the collar and lifted him up.
Mandri, still half-blind and stumbling, tried to shrug off Bib’s grip.
“I said piss off!”
Bib swung the torch round to Mandri’s face so close that it nearly singed his eyebrows.
“Say one more word and I’ll shove this thing down your throat.”
Mandri let himself be pulled, half blind and stumbling, out into the sun. When they got there, Bib let go and Mandri collapsed and let the warmth wash over him. The orange sand swallowing his knees was hot but comfortably so, like . He dug his hands into it. Mandri wanted to dive into it like a horse-backed lizard.
Bib shouted, “Ayram!”
Mandri looked up and squinted at the blob of shadow out in front of him. 
After a moment of trying to parse the blob of light and shadow in front of him, Mandri realized that he wasn’t quite out of the cave yet, for the tunnel ‘exit’ was more of an entrance into the bottom of a fat cylindrical pit. All around there were walls of sheer vertical limestone rising up a good thirty feet to encircle a pit of orange sand. The sun’s light angled down the sides of this colossal white limestone bucket, leaving half the pit in cold shadow, and half in a dusty, radiant glow.
Bib was shielding his eyes, looking for someone hidden in the cool shadows of the other side of the pit. Mandri saw a few dark and lumpy shapes against the limestone and assumed they were people, but he couldn’t quite make them out.
Bib shouted for his leader.
“Ayram!”
One of the shadows spoke up and said, “He’s not here.” 
“Where in the hell is he?”
“He’s in the cloister with Elrahet.”
Bib dashed back into the darkness of the tunnel, leaving Mandri in the sun alone, spotlighted against the sand.
Mandri squinted into the shadow of the pit and was struck dumb by the glare of strangers descending upon him. 
An attractive Zosan woman stepped into the light. Her smooth, dark face was framed by a white linen scarf that was loosely wrapped around her head and neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige burnoose. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of life out in the Sand, the lady wore it with a hint of regal bearing - she held her shoulders in a kind of self-important sweep that showed she knew how to stand; amongst those obsessed with refinement, even standing is an art. 
Her voice was almost as imperious as her uncompromising stare. 
“You’re the dead boy,” she said. 
Yes, Mandri was the dead boy. It was such a simple matter of fact, but the way she said it made it seem like it was some keen insight that was obvious only to her. 
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. He was anxious not to appear too ruffled. He narrowed his eyes and sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it when he saw the woman smirk.
“I am Moteah,” she said with the same degree of , like this, too, was a revelation. She wrinkled her nose as she looked down on Mandri. Apparently she could smell the death on him. Then she made a show of shaking some thought out of her head, and said, “That man who brought you out here-”
“Bib?”
“Yes. Bib. Do you know why he was so hasty?”
Mandri smiled. “Your other prisoner escaped.”
“The Mazydai escaped?”
“Yes.”
The word was hardly out of Mandri’s mouth when three scraggly men, all wrapped up in deep desert fashion, leapt up out of the shadows and sprinted across the sand towards Mandri. In three strides they brushed right past him, and on the fourth they disappeared into the dark tunnel, leaving cloud of dust swirling in the entrance behind them.
Moteah held her arms up before anyone else could follow. The loose sleeves of her burnoose 
“No one else!” she shouted. “The Mazyd has nowhere to go. Ayram and the others will deal with it.”
All the while her eyes were fixed on Mandri.
Mandri is like, fuck.
“On the off chance you that aren’t a living curse, I’d like to extend you the courtesy of welcome.”
Moteah took a half-step back, bowed at the waist, and flourished her arm in Mandri’s general direction. 
A few chuckles chorused out of the pit’s shadow.
“You will have to forgive my fellow Ayramun for not receiving you warmly,” Moteah said. “After all, you are a harbinger of death.”
“A what?” Mandri asked.
Moteah waved Mandri’s confusion away and turned towards the shadowed side of the pit to address her fellow Ayramun. Her voice rang out louder now so that everyone was sure to hear. “There’s no reason to treat this one here any differently than any other.” 
A rattled old voice shouted out, “At least not till Ayram has sussed him out!”
“So show him respect until-”
A grumbling voice shot of out of the dark. “Show him a dog’s dick, I will!”
“Not till Ayram has sussed him out, you won’t!”
She looked up to the rim of the pit and shouted, “Did you hear that, Sonny?”
A disappointed voice echoed down.
“Yeah, yeah.”
Moteah puffed herself up and said, “I shouldn’t have to say this to you all, but thing’s being what they are… No one gives anyone else any shit unless Ayram says so. That includes this boy.”
She gestured wide towards Mandri. A few unconvinced grunts followed.
“Now,” Moteah said, continuing to address the shadows, “Who has Papi’s clothes?”
No one answered.
Moteah stamped her foot. “The boy needs wrapping before we set out and Papi’s clothes will fit. So, who took them?”
“For pity’s sake, woman. Papi’s been not been dead two days.”
“Where Papi is now, do you think he cares what happens to his clothes?”
“I care.”
“Did you take his clothes, then, Pelt?”
“No. Sob did.”
Moteah head turned to the right. “Sob? Do you have Papi’s clothes?”
No one answered.
Moteah turned towards Mandri and motioned for him to follow her into the shade, and so he did.
 Tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit’s crescent shadow was a burly man stretched out amongst a couple burlap sacks. This man’s head was little more than a wiry bush of black, for between the beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a blotch of skin anywhere. There was a mouth in there somewhere, because sticking out of it was a smoking pipe of freeweed. 
The man was propped up on one elbow. He took one look at Mandri and said, “The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care. I won’t get sick of the whimpering.”
Moteah introduced Mandri to this irascible bush of a man with a sigh. “This is Sob,” she said.
Sob grunted.
“Sob is an idiot,” Moteah said.
“Come off it,” Sob moaned.
“Are those Papi’s clothes?” she asked as she pointed to the bundle of clothes against which Sob was leaning.
Sob patted the bundle with care and said. “They are. Make a nice pillow, don’t they. I’ll give ‘em to the boy, but not ‘til Ayram commands it.”
“Give them here,” Moteah said, undeterred. 
“Woman. What did I just say?”
“You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn’t ready to go when he gets out here?”


“Fine! Alright.” he moaned. “Should have led with that.” 
“I shouldn’t have to lead with anything. You should just do what I tell you to do.”
Sob sat up and made to undo the string wrapping the bundle of clothes under neath him, grumbling as he did it. “You know, last I checked this was the Ayramun.”
“What’s your point.”
Sob gave up trying to undo a troublesome knot. He tossed the wrapped bundle of clothes at Mandri’s feet and said, “Go on. But you need be remembering whose clothes those really belong.”
“I’ve heard,” Mandri said. “They’re Papi’s.”
“No.” Sob scowled. “They’re Ayram’s.”
Mandri looked from Sob to Moteah in confusion.
“They’re not Ayram’s, Ayram’s,” Sob said. “What I mean is that everything’s Ayram’s ‘ere. Clothes on me back. Them clothes there at your feet. The food that’s comin to your belly. It’s all loaned out, if you like. We’re the Ayramun. Everything’s Ayram’s. Not yours, and not Moteah’s either. Don’t go lettin her on about that. But go on.”
Mandri picked up the bundle. He pulled at the plaited hemp string and unrolled the clothes onto the ground. He picked out a few items that looked comfortable. There was a thick white linen tunic that was crumpled with salt and sweat, and some brown leather pants with a black stripe sewn down the sides. There was also a pair of rawhide shoes that, when he put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the shirt had a blood stain around the collar and the the sleeves were a little ragged at the wrists. Mandri didn’t complain though.
When finally had it all on, Sob looked him up and down with a peculiar stare and said, “That’s what Papi wore when he got killt.”
Mandri felt a chill run through his bones.
Sob started grabbing up the clothes the clothes 
“I thought you said they were Ayram’s.”

Sob nodded. “Like Moteah said, the Lad’s dead. He don’t want em.” He pointed to Mandri’s shirt and his lips spread into another warped smile. 
“I don’t know. I don’t know if I’m comfortable wearing this.”
Sob stopped what he was doing to stare at Moteah and say, “Ain’t ya comfortable, though?” 
Moteah rolled her eyes and said, “You’ll be fine.”
“I don’t know. It seems, uh, it seems a bit rude to be wearing these.”
“Ain’t it, though?”
Moteah reassured him. “It’s fine.”
Mandri looked down at the bloodstained sleeves. He wondered if this was some kind of joke. “I don’t suppose you’ve got anything else I could wear?” he asked.
“There’s nothing wrong with those,” Moteah said.
“Hell of a lot wrong with those.” Sob said. Mandri was looking at him all concerned so Sob clarified. “Those clothes have got to be threaded with the worst luck imaginable, don’t they?”
“Don’t get started,” Moteah said.
“Ain’t not matter about startin’, cause as far as them clothes are concerned, well, Papi was wearin’ ‘em, weren’t he?”
Moteah groaned and 
Sob looked towards Mandri and whispered like Moteah wasn’t standing right there and could hear. “This woman don’t know about luck.”
Another Ayramun, a thin, wiry woman sitting nearby, piped up. “That cause she ain’t got any luck.”
“Wrong!” Sob said, clearly sore about being interrupted. “There’s no such thing as ‘no luck’. There’s only good luck and bad luck. No luck at all is just bad luck.”
Moteah rolled her eyes and said, voice thick with derision, “Sob knows all about luck, don’t you Sob.”
“Damn right I do,” Sob said.
Sob reached down into a leather pack at his side and took from it a round pouch the size of his fist. He loosed the string the kept it closed and revealed to Mandri an assortment of rocks and pebbles. “Alright, take one o’ me rocks. As token of respect.”
The wiry woman nearby was. She was looking all surprised.
“These are lucky rocks, boy. Count yourself blessed.”
“Only small measures of luck,” Sob corrected. “Won’t balance out them clothes, but it’s a step.”
“They’re lucky rocks?” Mandri asked as he looked over the stones with a skeptical eye.
“Of course!” The fact that Mandri was expressing doubt seemed offensive to him, and so Sob drew out his frustration with a sneer. “They’ve been tested. And if I say they’ve been tested, they’ve been tested.”
“Tested how?”
Sob threw up his hands. “You dumb?”
“No.”
“How do you test anything? You pick it up, try to do somethin’ with it, then see what happens. If it works, good chance the thing is lucky. If it works ten times over, then its been tested, ain’t it?”
“I guess.”
“I keep the real unlucky rocks, too,” Sob continued. “They’re not as good as a curse pot, but if someone gets to pesterin’ you, and you think they need a spot of bad-luck, slip a bad-luck pebble into their pocket. They’re good for that. Little stones of retribution. I keep mine separate.” Sob then took another pouch from out of his things, and opened it to reveal another bunch of rocks. Each of these had a white ‘X’ carved into them. Sob picked one of them up and smiled at Moteah while he thumbed it’s grooves.
“Ever seen one of these babies, Moteah?” he asked.
She didn’t say anything back.
Mandri, eager to cut through the hostility that was shaping up between the two, decided to distract the hostilities with a question. He didn’t have to put much effort into pretending to care about the answer, because this was a tactic he’d learned from his mother while even in the womb. “The thing I don’t understand is, how does it all work?”
“What do you mean?” Sob asked.
“How does luck move from a thing to a person? You talk about luck ‘balancing out’, so does luck rub off like dust, or is it some kind of ‘aura’ which accounts for all the things on a person, or what?”
“Don’t get him started,” Moteah said, but Mandri’s question had hooked Sob with ease. The poor man jumped right into his theory of luck.
“It’s a bit strange, isn’t it,” Sob said. “You could certainly think of it like luck rubbing off. But I suppose more like a flow of energy. But there’s mechanics to it. There’s little quirks you got to learn by experience. You may wonder why I was restin’ my head on Papi’s clothes, considerin’ they’re unlucky. See, when your sleepin’, unlucky things will drain the un-luck out of ye, and good luck things will drain the good luck out of you. But that’s only when you’re sleepin’. ‘Cause when we’re sleeping we become inanimate things, subject to natural laws. Like how if you’re awake in a river you sink, but if you sleep you float like log.”
“Is that how that works?” Mandri wondered aloud.
“You ever try swimming while sleeping?”
“I suppose not.”
“When we’re awake and moving about and decidin’ things, it’s the normal mechanics of luck. But like I say, there’s quirks to it.”
“What are the normal mechanics of luck?”
“You know - luck. You know how luck works.”
“I don’t.”
“You don’t know… well you are a young fella…”
Moteah snorted. “He’s putting you on, Sob,” she said. “Nobody cares about this.”
“I am not,” Mandri said. “I want to know how luck works. I mean my life’s been shit, and maybe that’s because I’ve not been paying attention to this kind of thing. If there’s mechanics to luck, it’s worth hearing about.”
Moteah was stunned. “Look at him,” she said, pointing to Sob. “Sob’s the unluckiest bastard I’ve ever met. Look at his face. Oh, he doesn’t mind. He knows he’s ugly as hell. Guess how he got those scars.”
“I don’t know.”
“The man was swallowed by an king Kedrakeen.”
“But I survived! Who you know that survived the stomach of a full-grown Kedrakeen? Who you ever hear about do it? No one. None but me because I’m lucky.”
“Lucky to have survived? Sure. Unlucky as hell to ever get swallowed in the first place.”
Mandri was a little stunned by Moteah’s bluntness, but Sob wasn’t. Neither was he offended. His face was alight with relish, his smile was the wry smile of a man whose combantant had just set him up with the perfect stage to make a point.
“But that’s just the thing!” he said, left eye wide with excitement. “You need some unluck to really know about luck. It’s the always-lucky that don’t know a thing about luck because they don’t need to! They putter around, never steppin’ in any holes, and so they think that holes don’t exist! Never trust a lucky man’s ways. But someone like me, I’ve stepped in all the holes, I know my way around them by now. I’ve got Luck mapped as well as anybody whose ever lived.”
“There’s no real thing as luck,” Moteah countered. “And if there is, you certainly don’t know about it.”
Sob turned to Mandri to plead his case. “Son, if I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?”
Mandri knew that Sob was fishing for answer, so he gave it. “It’s luck.”
Moteah interjected. “Luck has nothing to do with it. It’s skill.”
“It’s luck!” Sob retorted. “Skill says whether or not you hit the target. Aim at the neck, and if you’re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it hits a vein or the meat of the muscle.”
Moteah groaned. “No one walks away from a shot in the neck,” she said.
“What do you call this, then?” Sob replied. He pulled at his collar to reveal a long white scar that wrapped round the left side of his neck. “Arrow that did this was shot from just twenty paces. Right through the neck. A mercenary from the Isle of Screte, no less; as skilled as any Aryamun with a bow. But his arrow as unlucky. The sum of the luck between the wood, the feathers, the glue, the string, the arrowhead, the archer, it wasn’t enough to beat me. And half my luck is these stones. I’d wager more than money that my stones is what saved me. Like Moteah says, my natural luck is shit. It’s cause of these stones that I’m talking to you know.”
“Alright then,” Moteah said. “Let’s make a bet. Let me ‘test’ one of your lucky stones’”
“You know I don’t bet,” Sob said.
“But you just said -”,
“It’s not morally right for me to be takin’ advantage of others in matters of luck. But enough talk,” Sob said, eager to move on before Moteah could press the issue. “Go on, Mandri, take one o’ my stones and see for yourself.” 
“Actually I was thinking that I want to get some experience myself.” Mandri said. “Like you say, learn the quirks. I think I’ll just pick up a stone off the ground, then test it, like you say.”
Sob’s face lit up. At least, the left side of it did. “That’s good! That’s the spirit!” Between his exlamations, Sob’s nose wiggled and WRM.
Mandri stepped over to the cave wall and pulled a little black shard of rock from it. He chose that particular piece because it stood out from the red sandstone. He thought it was a piece of jet, but it was quite rough to the touch, didn’t catch the light the same way, and it was shaped like a short, fat, carrot, fitting quite comfortably in his palm. 
“Odd choice.” Sob said. “I go for smaller, rounder stones. Easier to accumulate. But before you get to testin’, you need to be makin’ sure your luck is balanced out as best can be. How’s your natural luck? Naked as you came, how unlucky are you?”
“I’d say I’m pretty unlucky.”
“Are you cursed?”
“How would I know?”
Sob shrugged. “You should find that out, no? But Hill’s cloak is strong, I’ve seen it in action. It should keep you nice and balanced. Keep in mind, though, it takes time to get a feel fer these kind o’ things. You shouldn’t be expectin’ quick results.”
Mandri stuffed his new stone into his pocket. Then he pointed at Sob’s pouch of rocks. “What if Ayram wanted those?” he asked.
Sob cocked his ear. “What?”
“Well, they’re not your rocks, right? They’re Ayram’s. You said everything was Ayram’s.”
“What do you mean?”
“You said that everything was Ayram’s,” Mandri repeated. “ You said that everything is ‘loaned out’. That includes your lucky rocks, right?”
Sob glared at Mandri.
“Now why would you want to know about that?” he asked.
“I was just wondering. You said that -”
“Now hold on. I want to know what you’re on my lucky rocks for?”
“I was just wondering -”
“Don’t be out here wondering,” Sob said, cutting Mandri short. “Wondering about other people and what they’ve got will get you into trouble. So you just worry bout your rocks and I’ll worry bout mine.”
“I warned you not to get him started,” Moteah muttered.
“Get me started?” Sob said in mock offense. “I’m not started. I’m just tryin to keep the boy focused on what’s he needs to be focused on, and that’s his own damned luck.”
“Alright, alright,” Mandri said, trying to calm Sob down. “What should I do then? How should I test my new rock?”
“What do you want to do?”
Mandri thought for a moment. “Well, I’d like to get up and get out of this cave.”
“That’s not how it works,” Sob said. “You don’t wish-upon-a-stone. You’ve got to use the stone to do somethin’ like -”

            <Title>Ayram handed Mandri a few strings of jerked beef. It was a morning present to liven his spirits, and this it did with some aplomb, for the beef was spiced with peppercorn and, at some point in it’s humble existence, it had been soaked in a honeyed jelly.
It buttered him up, but for what?
Ayram said, “If you see a man on our journey through the pass, don’t stop and point. Don’t stop walking for any reason, unless I say.”
“Why?”
Ayram cringed as if Mandri had just spit on his boot.
“Do what I say,” Ayram said, “and do it without question. Once we’re through the pass, you can piss in the wind all you like.”
Ayram stomped off, his spud bar thudding against the dirt. His enormous pack was already fastened to his shoulders, and as he took off south along the edge of the mountain’s feet, and the rest of the Ayramun got up and followed him. Moto stayed behind and gave Mandri a kick.
“Get up.”
Mandri sighed, popped the last pinch of beef into his mouth, and savored its flavors. He stretched the moment with a beatific smile, and just before Moto was about to kick him again, he stood up, then put Obo in his litter. 
As Mandri fitted the straps of Obo’s litter onto his back, Moto said, “One thing that Ayram forgot to mention: don’t talk.” He gave Obo an evil eye and added, “That goes doubly for you.”
“But how will I pass the time?” Obo asked.
“In silence.”
“What are you so worried about? You said that every tribe would honor the sanctity of Goree Pass.”
“Not at night. We can’t be found there at night, so we have to get through it in one day, which will be easy enough if you get a move on, Mandri.”
“Alright, alright.”
Mandri set off at a clip to catch up to Ayram’s column.
They walked for an hour in the blue shadow of the mountains, Ayram the mother duck in front, and Moto in the back, with everyone in the middle keeping a tight formation.
Twice Mandri clipped Moteah’s heels. The first time she ignored it. The second, she stopped and glared at him. Mandri said sorry and spiced it with a sheepish grin, then added that his legs were too used to flat ground. The rocks here popped up like roots, and it was hard to take his eyes off the massive, swooping, wind-carved edifices that towered to his left. The great bulk of the sandstone had such a smooth, cupped curve, that it looked like a giant red wave rolling into the desert.
As they walked south, the character of the stone changed. It was more fractured, split, and crumbly. The ground was littered with boulders, they had to weave up into the foot of the mountain, and weave a trail around scattered boulders.
As far as passes go, the Goree Pass was not easily passable. By the time their course headed east, the way was a maze of swerving stone pillars and water-carved canyons the width of person. Mandri tried to map the place mentally, but gave up the third time that Ayram led them into a dead end. More of a canyon root system, as if a tree the size of a storm cloud grew here, and it’s roots had carved out these paths.
Striated canyons. Flanged red rock. At times the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the mountains stretching up beyond vision, and those mountains weren’t the only thing that took getting used to. The air was buzzing with the faint, wheezing screeches of vultures soaring on thermals high overhead, out of sight, glimpsed, so far out that these shrieks reached Mandri’s ear like whispers. If he didn’t know better, he would have thought it was the haggard language of the rocks.
And there were delights in these canyon paths - pools of water resting in shallow basins, sheltered from the sun, deep enough for Mandri to scrape a handful and splash his face.
 It’s too easy to personify a landscape. Every painter does it. A rolling hill becomes a . A mountain becomes a. to greater or lesser degrees. A landscape has a character. 


Obo gives sharp whistle, Mandri to cringe.
Ayram stopped the march. He stepped out of line and glared at Mandri. Mandri pointed his thumb at Obo. 
“Do I need to muzzle you?”
 Obo’s clarient drawl d, “Could you please pick up that bone over there? On the other side of that rock, there’s a bone that I’d like to take a look at.”
Mandri craned his neck around to see what Obo was talking about. In so doing, around to see.
“Mandri, please turn back around.”
“I want to see what you’re talking about.”
Moto had wandered over to a knee-high shoulder of rock, and he knelt down to pick something up.
A gleaming white ball joint and a short, splintered haft of bone.
“It’s a leg knuckle,” Moto said. He handed it to Ayram.
Mandri said, “It’s called a femur.”
 Elrahet pushed through the gathering crowd and asked, “What’s the matter?”
“The Mazyd wants to look at this bone.”
Everyone looked at Mandri.
“See that fracture?” Obo said, “That’s an unusual fracture.”
“What’s unusual about it?” asked Seb.
Obo said, “Breaking a bone along its length is not easy, not likely to happen accidentally.”
In Ayrams probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “You’re saying there’s been a killing in the Pass?”
Moto pointed at some discoloration on the and said, “Somewhat recent, too, by the looks of it.”
“Not just a killing,” said Obo. “A blow to the leg would not result in a medial split like that. Well, that could happen, but the chances of that would be one in a million. Accidental.”
Elrahet grumbled, “What’s your point?”
Obo said, “I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people... See, that is the kind of fracture a human makes when he wants to gnaw on the spongy marrow.”
Mandri’s mind ran flush with images of a barbarian gnawing on a bone as if it were an ear of corn. He turned around to get another look at that bone.
Ayram tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of his finger.
“How far away are the Hrks?” he asked.
“The only thing I can say for certain is that they’re headed this way, and not just from the east. They’ll be looking to catch us coming out of the Pass from the west as well.”
“Ahhh, fuck.”
“We should be moving,” Seb said. “So what if there’s a bone? It doesn’t mean anything. This is the Goree Pass, no one would dare break its sanctity.”
“Seb, be quiet.”
“But we don’t have a choice! We’ve got to keep going!”
“Seb, another word, and I’m going to get upset.”
Mandri is like fuck. A bit humilitating. Watch Purl, bored.
“There’s a whole mess of bones over here.”
Everyone crowded around Purl. At her feet was a jumble of broken leg and arm bones.
“Someone’s had a fest,” said 
“Moto.”
“Yes?”
“I want you and your sister to scout ahead, the whole length of the pass. If there’s people, if there’s an ambush, I want to know about it.”
“That will take a few hours.”
“We need to know what we’re walking into. The rest of us will find a place to keep out of sight, near this spot.”
“I should go too,” said Seb.
“Two is enough.”
Both Moto and Moteah dropped their shimmied out of their packs and Moto pulled out two long sandstone-colored cloaks, tossed one to Moteah, and then they clambered up the southern slope and disappeared from view.
Ayram led the everyone else back east, where he’d seen a shallow mouth in the base of the northern slope, obscured, in part, by pillar of rock that looked like a giant seed. They all tucked themselves behind this pillar, so that an idle eye of anyone wandering by wouldn’t be able to see them.
Mandri settled in for a nice, long wait.

A fluttered flute of a whistle from the path.
Ayram pursed his lips and came .
Moteah rushed in, crouched, her red cloak bunched up at her feet and in a hurried whisper she said, “There’s an ambush. Only a few hundred yards ahead.”
“How many men?” Ayram whispered back.
“I Counted twelve. Couldn’t be more than twenty in all.”
Moto came stumbling in. “I counted fourteen. It’s an wider valley,” he said. “With a tall slope,” he flattened his hand in the air to illustrate the incline, nearly plumb. “At the top it’s a vertical wall of rock.”
“A canyon,” Moteah clarified.
“And at the bottom of this valley, there’s a boulder the size of Minting Rock sitting right in the middle, plugging the gap.”
“Is it impassible?” Ayram asked.
Moto said, “There’s a narrow tunnel carved into the bottom, tall enough for a horse. The ambush is set on the other side of this tunnel.”
“I bet they’ve pushed that boulder down themselves,” Moteah said.
Moto sighed and squatted down. His face contorted into a look of pained stress. “What’s strange is that there’s a man sitting at the tunnel entrance, pretending to be a traveler. At least that’s what I think he’s doing, cause he’s got a traveler’s pack.”
“It’s bait,” said Moteah
“But what do they need bait for?” Moto asked. “They’ve got the ambush set, just spring it! Don’t need to put a man down in the valley where he’s liable to get pricked.”
Ayram folded his arms.
Scratched his nose.
Rubbed his bushy brow with his finger and thumb.
“Thirty men, you say?”
“Twenty at most,” said Elrahet.
“I counted fourteen,” Moto reminded everyone.
Ayram drummed his fingers against his chin, then tugged at his bottom lip. He was such a perfect picture of indecision, that Mandri nearly asked for a slip of paper so that he could draw it, and not just Ayram, the scene itself. Sometime nature has a way of organizing itself into a natural composition. Ayram there, standing tall, his head the apex of a pyramid of people, all looking at him for direction, and the weight of their expectations sat heavy on his brow.
It was Elrahet who broke the edge. Her words a firm encouragement. “We are going through,” she said.
“They know we’re coming, that much is clear. Still, it is only twenty… though we’ve only five arrows between us.”
He turned his cutting eye to Obo and said, “I don’t suppose you’d be any help.”
Obo lit up with astonishment. A cheeky split his lips as he watched everyone watch him.
“Aren’t I alluring…” he said.
“Right now, they’re sitting there stewing, wondering why we haven’t shown up.”
“And let me guess, you’re thinking we should all amble right on into that trap, spring it, and when all the little weeds sprout out from behind the rocks, have me deal with them.”
“You killed fifty of my own people in a ravine. In the rain. With the light of day, you could kill twenty freaks with one flick of your neck.” 
“I admit that I could, but I’m surprised you’re willing to put all these lives in my hands.”
“I’m not. It’ll just be you and me.”
“Oh?”
“I’m going to carry you into that ambush, and when those demons pop out of their hiding places, you’re going to blast their heads into oblivion.”
“Is that what I’m going to do?” said Obo.
Ayram and knelt down .
“You’re going to do it, because there’s no scenario here where you betray me and walk out alive.”
“I thought you understood that threats have no effect on me.”
Ayram. 
“It’s either you agree to do it, or you die.”
Obo contemplative moment.
“I know that stress has a way of narrowing vision, but there is an infinite number of ways you could approach my reluctance to comply with your desires. There’s really no need to compress it down to two. If you asked me, I think you should explore the possibility space of -”
Interrupted when Ayram slammed his chisel in the rock right next to Obo’s neck. 
Obo glanced at the cold iron bar which brushed his skin and said, “Look, I’ll do it.” He then pointed to the spud bar and said, “But this isn’t why I’m going to do it. I’ll do it on the condition that you open your heart to good graces of your nature and say, ‘thank you’.”
“You’ll get no pleasure from me.”
“I didn’t ask for pleasure, I asked for thanks. A good, honest, ‘Thank you!’. That’s all. Acknowledgment that I helped, and that I helped even though I did need to.”
Ayram stood up and straightened his back. As his taught lips squirmed in , as if the words left such distaste.
 “This is ridiculous,” said Elrahet as she stepped forward. She stuck out her proud chin and said, “I’ll say thank you.”
Obo smiled and said, “That would be sufficient.”
Elrahet cleared her throat, and said, “Thank you, creature.”
“I don’t want to take advantage,” said Obo, “but could you say it once more without the ‘creature’?”
“Thank you.”
Obo pretended to pinch the words with his fingers, and then in a rectifying tone he said, “Thank you, Mazydobo.”
Elrahet grinned, of a person eager to show that their immune to , said, “Thank you, Mazydobo... Will that do?”
“It will.”
“Good. Now, go and murder those miscreants.”
Obo flourished his arms and bowed as deeply as he could. “I am at your service,” he said.
Seb cried, “We can’t trust him!”
Moto nodded. “Seb’s right,” he said. “This creature has no cause to help. It would be suicide to stride into a nest of bows with him at your back.”
“I know that you don’t have a reason to trust me, but that’s only because you haven’t given me the chance to prove that I’m trustworthy. This is such an opportunity, if Ayram is willing to give it.”
“Ayram… twenty bows means you’re liable to get pricked.”
“I’ve been tickled with arrows before,” said Ayram.
“I had to bring you back from that,” Elrahet grumbled. “I won’t be able to help this time.”
Moteah was the only one with determination. “There’s no way around,” she said. “At least, none we can take without running into Hrks.” 
“It’s either this, or we start from scratch.”
“We should go together,” Purl said.
“No,” said Ayram. “More bodies won’t help.”
Mandrameen listened with rapt attention, for the occasion had his heart aflutter with a restless energy, like he’d just drank a quart of burn-nut tea. His arms and legs felt curious, and there was an urge to inject himself into the situation.
And there was a logic to him getting involved.
Obo needed to be carried into a dangerous place, and Mandri had been carrying Obo for days. Why stop now?
There was chance whoever did it could be killed, and Mandri had been cheating death for the past few weeks. Why stop now?
The universe was lining him up for this.
On top of it all, he had Sob’s lucky rocks. He didn’t believe in luck, but the fact he had the rocks at all was a sign of his auspicious future, it was part of the theme, as the Solitants say,  ‘when Solraheen speaks to you, it’s not in words, it’s in coincidences.’ He was given those rocks so that they could encourage him now, in this moment, a against is robe, and when this emotion reached the boiling point, he stood up straight and blurted out, “I’ll do it.”
The words landed amongst the Ayram like a duck. Moto looked at Mandri like he’d just  . Elrahet, like a . Purl snorted in disbelief. Moteah heard but pretended she hadn’t.  Ayram smirked, and said, “Now’s not the time, Mandri.”
“Look,” said Mandri, “All you need is someone to walk into that ambush… I’m willing to do it.”
Moto said, half in jest, “Mandri, Now him, we can’t trust.”
“What’s there to trust?” Mandri asked. “I walk over there, and Obo blasts them all to Shis.”
“He’s serious,” Moteah said with a hint of amusement.
“He does have a death wish,” said Moto.
“This isn’t about that eunuch prophecy is it?” Purl asked.
Mandri said, “A little.”
A muted laugh , and Moteah shook her head and Mandri’s naivety. 
This was no laughing matter to Elrahet. Her visage was stone serious. “Many have died testing prophecy,” she said. “It is not a wise thing to do.”
Mandri said, “I should have died like ten times already. And I can tell by the fact that none of you are outright shutting me down, that you all like the idea. I know Ayram does.”
Ayram was a rigid pole. “I’m trying to think of a reason not to let you do it,” he said.
“Worst that can happen is I die,” Mandri said. “And let’s be honest, it’s better me than you.”
“Can’t argue with that,” said Seb.
Ayram shot Seb a annoyed look, then held Mandri in his disquieting gaze. A pregnant silence emerged in that little interstice, and a doubtful anxiety started to creep up Mandri’s spine. He decided that if he just started acting, that put an end to it. It would shift Ayram’s burden from one of command, to a reserved acceptance of this new reality.
He bent down, picked up Obo’s litter, which still had Obo strapped in it, and then shouldered the burden and said, “Alright. Now which way is my uncertain death?”
“Hold on,” Ayram said. He placed his massive hand on Mandri’s shoulder. “Wait.”
Then Ayram turned to Moto and said, “Take what arrows we have and get up as high as you can.”
Without so much as a nod, Moto set to gathering what he’d need.
“And you,” Ayram said to Obo, “If this boy comes out of this unhurt, then I’ll say thank you.”
Ayram pointed out the path, a pitted road of sand that under a shelf of rock, and said, “Just follow it.” And so Mandri did.
He followed the path east as it wound through the shattered mountain. He felt like a hunter, careful to soften is footfalls, eyes trained on, limbs . He peeked around every rock and bend, should . 
Obo, impatient with this , said, “I’ll tell you when we’re almost there.”
But of course. Obo could . This reminded Mandri of something he’d been meaning to ask the Mazyd but hadn’t got the privacy to do it.
“Hey Obo?”
“What?”
“When the Ayramun ambushed you, did you let it happen?”
“What makes you think I’d do something as silly as that?”
“You can see through rock, can’t you?”
“I can not.”
“Then how are you always noticing things before anyone else.”
“I can see around rocks.”
“How?”
“Sound. It bounces off of things, and it bounces off them differently depending on the surface, be it rock, dirt, or lizard skin. Such adumbrations provide a fuzzy image of the contents of the room I’ve yet to enter, or the layout of the canyon ahead.”
“So you can hear an ambush before you walk into it?”
“There’s also smell. I can smell our friends already. If a creature is large enough, I can smell it from miles away, so long as the wind blows the reek in my direction. But I’ll know we’re close when I can hear them breathing.”
“How far away would that be?”
“It depends.”
“On what?”
“It’s not worth explaining.”
“Why not?”
“Lower your voice.”
Mandri lowered his voice to a whisper. The satisfaction of a penetrated truth was  “So, you did get captured on purpose!”
“I did.”
“And you got captured because you wanted to get close to Ayram.”
“I wanted to get close to Elrahet.”
“Well, that’s what I meant. But Elrahet is Ayram’s witch, and I don’t think Ayram will ever come around to giving you your freedom.”
“It’s not Ayram whom I’ve to convince.”
“Ayram won’t let Elrahet do anything without his say-so.”
“Is that so?”
“What are you on about? Of course it’s so. His name is Ayram, and she is Ayramun. And if that weren’t enough, he’s ten heads tall and his hand could crush a skull.”
“Mandri, the woman has power over life and death itself, and you think she’s not in control?”
The thought stopped Mandri in his tracks.
He tilted his head and looked aimlessly at the sky, which was beset with first few tufts of wispy cloud he’d seen in a week.
Was Elrahet in charge?
Was there something he hadn’t seen?
Nope.
“Mandri, keep moving.”
“Look,” Mandri said as he continued on walking. “I’ll defer to you on the subject of adumbrations, but clearly, you don’t know shit about people. Ayram’s in charge of all the Ayramun, and that’s that.”
“So you say.”
“Don’t ‘so you say’ me.”
“You want me to do you the dignity of 
“You’re correct in that I don’t know what it feels like to be a human, but there’s what it feels like to be you, and then there’s what you actually are, and I know what you actually are. You think that you’re some prophesied eunuch, but what you are is a boy with a burgeon addled brain, susceptible to flights of fancy, and these have led to the present moment where you walk dumbly into certain death, save for my goodwill. I’ve half a mind to let you die to teach you lesson.”
“You could let me die, but you won’t.”
“Forgive me, I said ‘teach a lesson,’ when I should have said ‘I’ll let you die to prove I’m right’, because for me, that’s a more attractive motive.”
“You wouldn’t do it.”
“We’ll find out soon. Just two bends left to go.”
The sudden awareness of flooded in. Confident yes, but he’d be lying if there fear wasn’t motivating his legs into.
Mandri walked, and when he came to the second bend, a shadowed, Obo told him to stop.
“I want to a clear sight of what we’re up against.”
Mandri peeked around first.
Around the bend, the way emptied out into a wider, sun-drenched valley. A mere twenty yards away, plugging up the middle of this valley, was a boulder twice the size of Minting Rock. It would have made the way impassable for a horse, but for the circular hole in its base, and this hole offered some estimation of the boulder’s girth, for the sunlight peeking through the other side could be blotted out with an arm-length thumb.
To right of the hole’s entrance, was the much anticipated man. He was robed in a honeyed yellow, an the color of unassumption, and he was strapped into a pack the size and shape of a small shed wrapped in a . he was sitting, legs straight out and limp, pack against the rock, pretending to sleep.
Pretending to snore. It was such a comically loud, open-mouthed, buck-toothed, snore, like the man wanted to make sure that at whatever distance, comers-along would know what he was up to - just an innocent daytime dream. 
His face betrayed that narrative. He had the look, if leathery skin of a mountain cannibal. A wild scraggle of curly hair framed a gleaming madman’s crown. His narrow face was beset by two large jug ears, and could almost hear the fleas crying out from the man’s pointed, scruff of a chin. And there was an animal look to him, for his nose and mouth protruded out, almost a snout, and while his crooked yellow teeth weren’t filed to a point, it was clear that he didn’t lead a balanced diet. 
Then again, maybe Mandri was reading too much into the man. He knew it was hard to disassociate what he knew about a person from what was there in the face’s features, and he knew this man was a cannibal, and so he saw a cannibal. Regardless, if he were to paint the man, it would be difficult to do what a good portrait artist is supposed to do and look upon the creature with a mother’s eyes.
“Looks like he’s taking a nap,” Mandri said in a breathless whisper. He’d never whispered so quietly in his life, wouldn’t have disturbed to the flight of a feather.
“He’s not napping,” whispered Obo.
“I know.”
Obo stirred his litter so that his whispered words carried directly into Mandri’s ear.
“Here’s the deal, Mandri. That man is dangerous.”
“I know that. He’s a cannibal…”
“I can not.”
“Alright. Welp. Here goes nothing.”
“Hoooold on, Mandri. Hold on.”
“What for? He’s bait, 
“He’s not bait. There’s no need for bait in this pass, as this is the only route a traveler can take.”
“Then what’s he there for?”
“If I had to guess, he’s going to waylay you with a disarming tale.”
“He’s a distraction?”
“Not quite. If I’m correct, then he’s going to want to get close to you.”
“So he can kill me.”
“No, so that he can kill me… I should lay this all out, as I see it. See, I think these bandits know more about our coming than just our number. I think they know of Ayram, and I think they know of me, and I think, that they think, that the best way to take out a Mazyd, if you haven’t a Riga, is to get close with deception and cut off the unsuspecting head. If I’m right, the trap won’t spring until I am killed.”
“How could they possibly know all that?”
“I believe they’ve been forwarned.”
“By who?”
“I have my suspicions.”
“But what about-”
“Sol’s breath, Mandri. Shut up for a moment!”
Mandri composed himself.
“Now, provided what I’ve said is true, that man has probably been told your description, and if he has, then he’s also been told that you’re the one who’s been carrying the Mazyd these long miles. He is going to try and get close to you to sniff me out. So please, for both our sakes, keep a good distance away from him.”
“What if he wants to shake hands?”
“Don’t.”
“Well, what am I supposed to say?”
“He knows who you are, so be honest, but twist it. Sprinkle the lie with grains of the truth. Say you’ve walked ahead of the others, and that they won’t be long behind. If he’s dumb, it’ll get him salivating.”
“What am I supposed to say if he wants to shake hands? I can’t just say no. That’s weird.”
“Mandri, improvise. You’ve a wit, so use it.”
“Alright,” Mandri said. He enjoyed the sense of 
“And one last thing,” Obo said. “What’s your favorite word?”
“I don’t have a favorite word.”
“Pick one at random.”
If Mandri was going to pick a favorite word, it wasn’t going to be at random. It was going to be a word that he liked, a bubbly word, fun to say, a word the captured something of his verve, and his taste for the divine, a word that, when spoken, could turn heads, and end all debate.
“My favorite word is Mandrameen”, he finally said.
Obo tsked, his voice threaded with a snarky gilt. “Pride is so repulsive. Especially in a human. At least when a lizard puffs its chest it does it because it knows its small.”
“It’s not about pride.”
“Whatever you say, Mandrameen.”
“Why’d you even ask?”
“Because when I’m ready to fill these heathen’s heads with the good word of Solraheen, I shall warn you first by saying your name. And when I say it, do not move. I can’t stress this enough - Do. Not. Move. Don’t crouch, don’t cringe, just stay perfectly still. You’re going to want to fling yourself about in terror, but if you don’t stand still, it’s going to mess everything up.”
Mandri glanced once more at the man. The frenzied whispering hadn’t ‘woken’ him up. There was little chance the had even reached him above his soaring snores.
“I’m excited,” Mandri said.
“You should be terrified. And remember,” Obo whispered. “Keep away from -”
“I know, I know,” Mandri said. “Keep away. Don’t move. I got it.”
Mandri chuckled at Obo’s harrumph, and then he stepped out the shadow of the canyon and walked towards the boulder and cannibal, keeping a steady, congenial smile. When he was near enough to formalize a greeting, he waved, but the man did not stir.
“Hullo there, sleepyhead!” Mandri said. Indulging the man’s deceit gave him a sense of control.
 The man snorted to with a fright, then looked up at Mandri and shaded his brow with an open hand.
“Hello, friend!” he said.
This close, Mandri could tell that the man was much younger than he imagined, perhaps not much older than himself.
“Happy to see ye,” the young man said, though he didn’t at look it, for his lips were still locked in that squinting sneer, his buckteeth gleaming in the sun.
“Same,” said Mandri, and he flashed a congenial smile.
The man shuffled his legs under him, a kind of frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his top-heavy pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up. Mandri was impressed.
“Name’s Greskal,” the man said. He held out his hand for Mandri to shake.
“I’m Mandri.” Mandri gave a curt wave, wrapped his thumbs under his pack’s straps.
Greskal looked at Mandri like he’d . He said, “Take it you scared as I to walk alone in this Pass.”
“This is the Goree.” Mandri said. “Why should I be scared?”
“Then you ain’t heard them rumors that the Goree is a gamble, ‘ave yah?”
“What rumors?”
“They say these days is tainted, say foul ilk breed in these hills, wearin’ in the skins of men. Was hopin’ somma like you’d pass me by. Don wanna head anymore east on my own. You is headed east?” 
He was looking at Mandri with expectant eyes. 
“Headed to Jeket.”
“Of course’n you’re headed to Jeket. Everybody’s headed to Jeket. I’m headed to Jeket, too. Got freshly spooled yarn needs sellin’.” He turned a little to show of his pack, giv. “Maybe I could take up with you?”
Ayram glares.

Ayram grunted. Smirked.
“Not a wrestler, then. Well don’t tell me, I’d like to guess. Me? I’m a mercenary, believe it or not. Hired sword for.”
“Put that away.”
“Of course, of course. I’d never dream of trying to battle a man your size. I just wanted to show you. It’s basically brand new.”
Tucks it into his scabbard. Sliced the webbing in his thumb.
“Ach!”
A little trickle of blood onto the sand swept ground. Tore a from his sleeve and wrapped his hand.
“Forgive me. I just haven’t seen anyone in a while and when that happens I get excitable. Overstep boundaries, you know. My name is Greskal, by the way.” He bowed his head.
“Greskal…” Ayram mused. “Well, Greskal, I think it’s best if we part ways.”
Bewildered. Looked east, then west.
“How?” he asked. “There’s only the one way, and you don’t own it. Can’t I walk where I please?”
“You can. Just know that as soon as we get out of the pass, I’ll kill you if you’re still in my shadow.”
“We’ll part ways once we leave the pass, okay?”
Ayram began again to walk. Greskal followed.
“What’s with the dour bunch back here? Are you folks mute, or what?”
“We have nothing to say to you,” grumbled Elrahet.
“Well I’ve some things to say to you,” Greskal said, impersonating Elrahet’s growl, amusing himself as he did. “Like, isn’t it funny that outside this pass you can kill to your heart’s content, but inside you can’t? Like there’s a magical line in the sand that determines good and evil. Just seems absurd to me. Morality doesn’t depend on where are, right? Like, ‘Stand here and killing is good, but do it two feet to the left, and Solraheen will damn your Spark to Shis.’ ”
“I don’t know,” Mandri said, “It kinda makes sense to me. Like what if-”
“Mandri!” Moto snapped.
“Is he not allowed to talk?
“No, he’s not,” said Moto.
“Why are you allowed to… What is that!?” Greskal cried. He was pointing at the swaddled Mazydobo.
Moto answered, “It’s the boy’s cripple brother.”
“Why’s he all pale like that?”
“A disease of the skin.”
“Don’t look human.”
Ayram stopped the line, stepped out, and beckoned Greskal with an impatient finger. “Come here,” he said.
“What for?”
“Because I said come here.”
“Look, let’s just keep on walking, shall we? I’ll be quiet, I promise. Just want the safety of numbers, is all. Like I said, there’s creatures out here.”
“Cut the shit.” said Ayram. The menace in his voice was nothing compared to the metallic chinnk of his iron bar thudding against ground.
“Cut what shit?” said Greskal. 
“Tell your men to come on out.”
Ayram pointed behind him with his thumb. High up on the northern ridge was a boulder that looked like a shark’s tooth, and out from behind it, like a weed, poked the wooden limb of a recurved bow.
A pregnant silence filled the red-rock valley, then a brusque, unintelligible whisper sounded out from the rocks above, and the wooden bow-tip was tucked out of sight.
Greskal shouted, “You know we can see you, right?”
A snarled retort sprang from unseen heights. 
“You can’t see shit!”
Greskal laughed, then cupped his mouth and shouted, “You’ve botched it!”
A black, turbaned head sprouted up from the boulder above and shouted back, “I didn’t botch nothin’! You botched it!”

Greskal looked to Ayram and asked, “Who gave it away, me or him?”
“Do you put this show on for every traveler you rob, or is this the first time? I’ll tell you this, two men ain’t going to cut it with me.”

Greskal sighed, walked over to the southern slope, and dropped his heavy pack. As he stretched his back, he said, “Your faith in Solraheen must be strong.”
“You going to kill us, or just take our things?” Ayram asked.
“I think you have the wrong idea,” said Greskal.
“Do I?”
“Schisol’s kin have been flocking eastward of late. So, I devised this plan to sniff them out, you see, they can’t resist easy meat.” He presented himself with open palms. “I show myself as a lonesome traveler, and when they reveal themselves for the monsters they are, my men riddle them with arrows.”
“Two men ain’t gonna cut it.”+
Greskal a shrill whistle that stood the hairs of Mandri’s neck on end. Twenty men rose up on either slope.
“Usually works like a charm, but seeing as you have a keen mind, I’m left with a conundrum: how do I know whether or not you’re a demon? Because you sure as shis look like you’ve been feasting on tainted flesh. And that creature on the boy’s back is certainly not natural either.”
Mandri felt Obo stir in the litter.


- in the chaos, elrahet says go to the ruined keep.

</Title>
            <Text>Ayram handed Mandri a few strings of jerked beef. It was a morning present to liven his spirits, and this it did with some aplomb, for the beef was spiced with peppercorn and, at some point in it’s humble existence, it had been soaked in a honeyed jelly.
It buttered him up, but for what?
Ayram said, “If you see a man on our journey through the pass, don’t stop and point. Don’t stop walking for any reason, unless I say.”
“Why?”
Ayram cringed as if Mandri had just spit on his boot.
“Do what I say,” Ayram said, “and do it without question. Once we’re through the pass, you can piss in the wind all you like.”
Ayram stomped off, his spud bar thudding against the dirt. His enormous pack was already fastened to his shoulders, and as he took off south along the edge of the mountain’s feet, and the rest of the Ayramun got up and followed him. Moto stayed behind and gave Mandri a kick.
“Get up.”
Mandri sighed, popped the last pinch of beef into his mouth, and savored its flavors. He stretched the moment with a beatific smile, and just before Moto was about to kick him again, he stood up, then put Obo in his litter. 
As Mandri fitted the straps of Obo’s litter onto his back, Moto said, “One thing that Ayram forgot to mention: don’t talk.” He gave Obo an evil eye and added, “That goes doubly for you.”
“But how will I pass the time?” Obo asked.
“In silence.”
“What are you so worried about? You said that every tribe would honor the sanctity of Goree Pass.”
“Not at night. We can’t be found there at night, so we have to get through it in one day, which will be easy enough if you get a move on, Mandri.”
“Alright, alright.”
Mandri set off at a clip to catch up to Ayram’s column.
They walked for an hour in the blue shadow of the mountains, Ayram the mother duck in front, and Moto in the back, with everyone in the middle keeping a tight formation.
Twice Mandri clipped Moteah’s heels. The first time she ignored it. The second, she stopped and glared at him. Mandri said sorry and spiced it with a sheepish grin, then added that his legs were too used to flat ground. The rocks here popped up like roots, and it was hard to take his eyes off the massive, swooping, wind-carved edifices that towered to his left. The great bulk of the sandstone had such a smooth, cupped curve, that it looked like a giant red wave rolling into the desert.
As they walked south, the character of the stone changed. It was more fractured, split, and crumbly. The ground was littered with boulders, they had to weave up into the foot of the mountain, and weave a trail around scattered boulders.
As far as passes go, the Goree Pass was not easily passable. By the time their course headed east, the way was a maze of swerving stone pillars and water-carved canyons the width of person. Mandri tried to map the place mentally, but gave up the third time that Ayram led them into a dead end. More of a canyon root system, as if a tree the size of a storm cloud grew here, and it’s roots had carved out these paths.
Striated canyons. Flanged red rock. At times the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the mountains stretching up beyond vision, and those mountains weren’t the only thing that took getting used to. The air was buzzing with the faint, wheezing screeches of vultures soaring on thermals high overhead, out of sight, glimpsed, so far out that these shrieks reached Mandri’s ear like whispers. If he didn’t know better, he would have thought it was the haggard language of the rocks.
And there were delights in these canyon paths - pools of water resting in shallow basins, sheltered from the sun, deep enough for Mandri to scrape a handful and splash his face.
 It’s too easy to personify a landscape. Every painter does it. A rolling hill becomes a . A mountain becomes a. to greater or lesser degrees. A landscape has a character. 


Obo gives sharp whistle, Mandri to cringe.
Ayram stopped the march. He stepped out of line and glared at Mandri. Mandri pointed his thumb at Obo. 
“Do I need to muzzle you?”
 Obo’s clarient drawl d, “Could you please pick up that bone over there? On the other side of that rock, there’s a bone that I’d like to take a look at.”
Mandri craned his neck around to see what Obo was talking about. In so doing, around to see.
“Mandri, please turn back around.”
“I want to see what you’re talking about.”
Moto had wandered over to a knee-high shoulder of rock, and he knelt down to pick something up.
A gleaming white ball joint and a short, splintered haft of bone.
“It’s a leg knuckle,” Moto said. He handed it to Ayram.
Mandri said, “It’s called a femur.”
 Elrahet pushed through the gathering crowd and asked, “What’s the matter?”
“The Mazyd wants to look at this bone.”
Everyone looked at Mandri.
“See that fracture?” Obo said, “That’s an unusual fracture.”
“What’s unusual about it?” asked Seb.
Obo said, “Breaking a bone along its length is not easy, not likely to happen accidentally.”
In Ayrams probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “You’re saying there’s been a killing in the Pass?”
Moto pointed at some discoloration on the and said, “Somewhat recent, too, by the looks of it.”
“Not just a killing,” said Obo. “A blow to the leg would not result in a medial split like that. Well, that could happen, but the chances of that would be one in a million. Accidental.”
Elrahet grumbled, “What’s your point?”
Obo said, “I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people... See, that is the kind of fracture a human makes when he wants to gnaw on the spongy marrow.”
Mandri’s mind ran flush with images of a barbarian gnawing on a bone as if it were an ear of corn. He turned around to get another look at that bone.
Ayram tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of his finger.
“How far away are the Hrks?” he asked.
“The only thing I can say for certain is that they’re headed this way, and not just from the east. They’ll be looking to catch us coming out of the Pass from the west as well.”
“Ahhh, fuck.”
“We should be moving,” Seb said. “So what if there’s a bone? It doesn’t mean anything. This is the Goree Pass, no one would dare break its sanctity.”
“Seb, be quiet.”
“But we don’t have a choice! We’ve got to keep going!”
“Seb, another word, and I’m going to get upset.”
Mandri is like fuck. A bit humilitating. Watch Purl, bored.
“There’s a whole mess of bones over here.”
Everyone crowded around Purl. At her feet was a jumble of broken leg and arm bones.
“Someone’s had a fest,” said 
“Moto.”
“Yes?”
“I want you and your sister to scout ahead, the whole length of the pass. If there’s people, if there’s an ambush, I want to know about it.”
“That will take a few hours.”
“We need to know what we’re walking into. The rest of us will find a place to keep out of sight, near this spot.”
“I should go too,” said Seb.
“Two is enough.”
Both Moto and Moteah dropped their shimmied out of their packs and Moto pulled out two long sandstone-colored cloaks, tossed one to Moteah, and then they clambered up the southern slope and disappeared from view.
Ayram led the everyone else back east, where he’d seen a shallow mouth in the base of the northern slope, obscured, in part, by pillar of rock that looked like a giant seed. They all tucked themselves behind this pillar, so that an idle eye of anyone wandering by wouldn’t be able to see them.
Mandri settled in for a nice, long wait.

A fluttered flute of a whistle from the path.
Ayram pursed his lips and came .
Moteah rushed in, crouched, her red cloak bunched up at her feet and in a hurried whisper she said, “There’s an ambush. Only a few hundred yards ahead.”
“How many men?” Ayram whispered back.
“I Counted twelve. Couldn’t be more than twenty in all.”
Moto came stumbling in. “I counted fourteen. It’s an wider valley,” he said. “With a tall slope,” he flattened his hand in the air to illustrate the incline, nearly plumb. “At the top it’s a vertical wall of rock.”
“A canyon,” Moteah clarified.
“And at the bottom of this valley, there’s a boulder the size of Minting Rock sitting right in the middle, plugging the gap.”
“Is it impassible?” Ayram asked.
Moto said, “There’s a narrow tunnel carved into the bottom, tall enough for a horse. The ambush is set on the other side of this tunnel.”
“I bet they’ve pushed that boulder down themselves,” Moteah said.
Moto sighed and squatted down. His face contorted into a look of pained stress. “What’s strange is that there’s a man sitting at the tunnel entrance, pretending to be a traveler. At least that’s what I think he’s doing, cause he’s got a traveler’s pack.”
“It’s bait,” said Moteah
“But what do they need bait for?” Moto asked. “They’ve got the ambush set, just spring it! Don’t need to put a man down in the valley where he’s liable to get pricked.”
Ayram folded his arms.
Scratched his nose.
Rubbed his bushy brow with his finger and thumb.
“Thirty men, you say?”
“Twenty at most,” said Elrahet.
“I counted fourteen,” Moto reminded everyone.
Ayram drummed his fingers against his chin, then tugged at his bottom lip. He was such a perfect picture of indecision, that Mandri nearly asked for a slip of paper so that he could draw it, and not just Ayram, the scene itself. Sometime nature has a way of organizing itself into a natural composition. Ayram there, standing tall, his head the apex of a pyramid of people, all looking at him for direction, and the weight of their expectations sat heavy on his brow.
It was Elrahet who broke the edge. Her words a firm encouragement. “We are going through,” she said.
“They know we’re coming, that much is clear. Still, it is only twenty… though we’ve only five arrows between us.”
He turned his cutting eye to Obo and said, “I don’t suppose you’d be any help.”
Obo lit up with astonishment. A cheeky split his lips as he watched everyone watch him.
“Aren’t I alluring…” he said.
“Right now, they’re sitting there stewing, wondering why we haven’t shown up.”
“And let me guess, you’re thinking we should all amble right on into that trap, spring it, and when all the little weeds sprout out from behind the rocks, have me deal with them.”
“You killed fifty of my own people in a ravine. In the rain. With the light of day, you could kill twenty freaks with one flick of your neck.” 
“I admit that I could, but I’m surprised you’re willing to put all these lives in my hands.”
“I’m not. It’ll just be you and me.”
“Oh?”
“I’m going to carry you into that ambush, and when those demons pop out of their hiding places, you’re going to blast their heads into oblivion.”
“Is that what I’m going to do?” said Obo.
Ayram and knelt down .
“You’re going to do it, because there’s no scenario here where you betray me and walk out alive.”
“I thought you understood that threats have no effect on me.”
Ayram. 
“It’s either you agree to do it, or you die.”
Obo contemplative moment.
“I know that stress has a way of narrowing vision, but there is an infinite number of ways you could approach my reluctance to comply with your desires. There’s really no need to compress it down to two. If you asked me, I think you should explore the possibility space of -”
Interrupted when Ayram slammed his chisel in the rock right next to Obo’s neck. 
Obo glanced at the cold iron bar which brushed his skin and said, “Look, I’ll do it.” He then pointed to the spud bar and said, “But this isn’t why I’m going to do it. I’ll do it on the condition that you open your heart to good graces of your nature and say, ‘thank you’.”
“You’ll get no pleasure from me.”
“I didn’t ask for pleasure, I asked for thanks. A good, honest, ‘Thank you!’. That’s all. Acknowledgment that I helped, and that I helped even though I did need to.”
Ayram stood up and straightened his back. As his taught lips squirmed in , as if the words left such distaste.
 “This is ridiculous,” said Elrahet as she stepped forward. She stuck out her proud chin and said, “I’ll say thank you.”
Obo smiled and said, “That would be sufficient.”
Elrahet cleared her throat, and said, “Thank you, creature.”
“I don’t want to take advantage,” said Obo, “but could you say it once more without the ‘creature’?”
“Thank you.”
Obo pretended to pinch the words with his fingers, and then in a rectifying tone he said, “Thank you, Mazydobo.”
Elrahet grinned, of a person eager to show that their immune to , said, “Thank you, Mazydobo... Will that do?”
“It will.”
“Good. Now, go and murder those miscreants.”
Obo flourished his arms and bowed as deeply as he could. “I am at your service,” he said.
Seb cried, “We can’t trust him!”
Moto nodded. “Seb’s right,” he said. “This creature has no cause to help. It would be suicide to stride into a nest of bows with him at your back.”
“I know that you don’t have a reason to trust me, but that’s only because you haven’t given me the chance to prove that I’m trustworthy. This is such an opportunity, if Ayram is willing to give it.”
“Ayram… twenty bows means you’re liable to get pricked.”
“I’ve been tickled with arrows before,” said Ayram.
“I had to bring you back from that,” Elrahet grumbled. “I won’t be able to help this time.”
Moteah was the only one with determination. “There’s no way around,” she said. “At least, none we can take without running into Hrks.” 
“It’s either this, or we start from scratch.”
“We should go together,” Purl said.
“No,” said Ayram. “More bodies won’t help.”
Mandrameen listened with rapt attention, for the occasion had his heart aflutter with a restless energy, like he’d just drank a quart of burn-nut tea. His arms and legs felt curious, and there was an urge to inject himself into the situation.
And there was a logic to him getting involved.
Obo needed to be carried into a dangerous place, and Mandri had been carrying Obo for days. Why stop now?
There was chance whoever did it could be killed, and Mandri had been cheating death for the past few weeks. Why stop now?
The universe was lining him up for this.
On top of it all, he had Sob’s lucky rocks. He didn’t believe in luck, but the fact he had the rocks at all was a sign of his auspicious future, it was part of the theme, as the Solitants say,  ‘when Solraheen speaks to you, it’s not in words, it’s in coincidences.’ He was given those rocks so that they could encourage him now, in this moment, a against is robe, and when this emotion reached the boiling point, he stood up straight and blurted out, “I’ll do it.”
The words landed amongst the Ayram like a duck. Moto looked at Mandri like he’d just  . Elrahet, like a . Purl snorted in disbelief. Moteah heard but pretended she hadn’t.  Ayram smirked, and said, “Now’s not the time, Mandri.”
“Look,” said Mandri, “All you need is someone to walk into that ambush… I’m willing to do it.”
Moto said, half in jest, “Mandri, Now him, we can’t trust.”
“What’s there to trust?” Mandri asked. “I walk over there, and Obo blasts them all to Shis.”
“He’s serious,” Moteah said with a hint of amusement.
“He does have a death wish,” said Moto.
“This isn’t about that eunuch prophecy is it?” Purl asked.
Mandri said, “A little.”
A muted laugh , and Moteah shook her head and Mandri’s naivety. 
This was no laughing matter to Elrahet. Her visage was stone serious. “Many have died testing prophecy,” she said. “It is not a wise thing to do.”
Mandri said, “I should have died like ten times already. And I can tell by the fact that none of you are outright shutting me down, that you all like the idea. I know Ayram does.”
Ayram was a rigid pole. “I’m trying to think of a reason not to let you do it,” he said.
“Worst that can happen is I die,” Mandri said. “And let’s be honest, it’s better me than you.”
“Can’t argue with that,” said Seb.
Ayram shot Seb a annoyed look, then held Mandri in his disquieting gaze. A pregnant silence emerged in that little interstice, and a doubtful anxiety started to creep up Mandri’s spine. He decided that if he just started acting, that put an end to it. It would shift Ayram’s burden from one of command, to a reserved acceptance of this new reality.
He bent down, picked up Obo’s litter, which still had Obo strapped in it, and then shouldered the burden and said, “Alright. Now which way is my uncertain death?”
“Hold on,” Ayram said. He placed his massive hand on Mandri’s shoulder. “Wait.”
Then Ayram turned to Moto and said, “Take what arrows we have and get up as high as you can.”
Without so much as a nod, Moto set to gathering what he’d need.
“And you,” Ayram said to Obo, “If this boy comes out of this unhurt, then I’ll say thank you.”
Ayram pointed out the path, a pitted road of sand that under a shelf of rock, and said, “Just follow it.” And so Mandri did.
He followed the path east as it wound through the shattered mountain. He felt like a hunter, careful to soften is footfalls, eyes trained on, limbs . He peeked around every rock and bend, should . 
Obo, impatient with this , said, “I’ll tell you when we’re almost there.”
But of course. Obo could . This reminded Mandri of something he’d been meaning to ask the Mazyd but hadn’t got the privacy to do it.
“Hey Obo?”
“What?”
“When the Ayramun ambushed you, did you let it happen?”
“What makes you think I’d do something as silly as that?”
“You can see through rock, can’t you?”
“I can not.”
“Then how are you always noticing things before anyone else.”
“I can see around rocks.”
“How?”
“Sound. It bounces off of things, and it bounces off them differently depending on the surface, be it rock, dirt, or lizard skin. Such adumbrations provide a fuzzy image of the contents of the room I’ve yet to enter, or the layout of the canyon ahead.”
“So you can hear an ambush before you walk into it?”
“There’s also smell. I can smell our friends already. If a creature is large enough, I can smell it from miles away, so long as the wind blows the reek in my direction. But I’ll know we’re close when I can hear them breathing.”
“How far away would that be?”
“It depends.”
“On what?”
“It’s not worth explaining.”
“Why not?”
“Lower your voice.”
Mandri lowered his voice to a whisper. The satisfaction of a penetrated truth was  “So, you did get captured on purpose!”
“I did.”
“And you got captured because you wanted to get close to Ayram.”
“I wanted to get close to Elrahet.”
“Well, that’s what I meant. But Elrahet is Ayram’s witch, and I don’t think Ayram will ever come around to giving you your freedom.”
“It’s not Ayram whom I’ve to convince.”
“Ayram won’t let Elrahet do anything without his say-so.”
“Is that so?”
“What are you on about? Of course it’s so. His name is Ayram, and she is Ayramun. And if that weren’t enough, he’s ten heads tall and his hand could crush a skull.”
“Mandri, the woman has power over life and death itself, and you think she’s not in control?”
The thought stopped Mandri in his tracks.
He tilted his head and looked aimlessly at the sky, which was beset with first few tufts of wispy cloud he’d seen in a week.
Was Elrahet in charge?
Was there something he hadn’t seen?
Nope.
“Mandri, keep moving.”
“Look,” Mandri said as he continued on walking. “I’ll defer to you on the subject of adumbrations, but clearly, you don’t know shit about people. Ayram’s in charge of all the Ayramun, and that’s that.”
“So you say.”
“Don’t ‘so you say’ me.”
“You want me to do you the dignity of 
“You’re correct in that I don’t know what it feels like to be a human, but there’s what it feels like to be you, and then there’s what you actually are, and I know what you actually are. You think that you’re some prophesied eunuch, but what you are is a boy with a burgeon addled brain, susceptible to flights of fancy, and these have led to the present moment where you walk dumbly into certain death, save for my goodwill. I’ve half a mind to let you die to teach you lesson.”
“You could let me die, but you won’t.”
“Forgive me, I said ‘teach a lesson,’ when I should have said ‘I’ll let you die to prove I’m right’, because for me, that’s a more attractive motive.”
“You wouldn’t do it.”
“We’ll find out soon. Just two bends left to go.”
The sudden awareness of flooded in. Confident yes, but he’d be lying if there fear wasn’t motivating his legs into.
Mandri walked, and when he came to the second bend, a shadowed, Obo told him to stop.
“I want to a clear sight of what we’re up against.”
Mandri peeked around first.
Around the bend, the way emptied out into a wider, sun-drenched valley. A mere twenty yards away, plugging up the middle of this valley, was a boulder twice the size of Minting Rock. It would have made the way impassable for a horse, but for the circular hole in its base, and this hole offered some estimation of the boulder’s girth, for the sunlight peeking through the other side could be blotted out with an arm-length thumb.
To right of the hole’s entrance, was the much anticipated man. He was robed in a honeyed yellow, an the color of unassumption, and he was strapped into a pack the size and shape of a small shed wrapped in a . he was sitting, legs straight out and limp, pack against the rock, pretending to sleep.
Pretending to snore. It was such a comically loud, open-mouthed, buck-toothed, snore, like the man wanted to make sure that at whatever distance, comers-along would know what he was up to - just an innocent daytime dream. 
His face betrayed that narrative. He had the look, if leathery skin of a mountain cannibal. A wild scraggle of curly hair framed a gleaming madman’s crown. His narrow face was beset by two large jug ears, and could almost hear the fleas crying out from the man’s pointed, scruff of a chin. And there was an animal look to him, for his nose and mouth protruded out, almost a snout, and while his crooked yellow teeth weren’t filed to a point, it was clear that he didn’t lead a balanced diet. 
Then again, maybe Mandri was reading too much into the man. He knew it was hard to disassociate what he knew about a person from what was there in the face’s features, and he knew this man was a cannibal, and so he saw a cannibal. Regardless, if he were to paint the man, it would be difficult to do what a good portrait artist is supposed to do and look upon the creature with a mother’s eyes.
“Looks like he’s taking a nap,” Mandri said in a breathless whisper. He’d never whispered so quietly in his life, wouldn’t have disturbed to the flight of a feather.
“He’s not napping,” whispered Obo.
“I know.”
Obo stirred his litter so that his whispered words carried directly into Mandri’s ear.
“Here’s the deal, Mandri. That man is dangerous.”
“I know that. He’s a cannibal…”
“I can not.”
“Alright. Welp. Here goes nothing.”
“Hoooold on, Mandri. Hold on.”
“What for? He’s bait, 
“He’s not bait. There’s no need for bait in this pass, as this is the only route a traveler can take.”
“Then what’s he there for?”
“If I had to guess, he’s going to waylay you with a disarming tale.”
“He’s a distraction?”
“Not quite. If I’m correct, then he’s going to want to get close to you.”
“So he can kill me.”
“No, so that he can kill me… I should lay this all out, as I see it. See, I think these bandits know more about our coming than just our number. I think they know of Ayram, and I think they know of me, and I think, that they think, that the best way to take out a Mazyd, if you haven’t a Riga, is to get close with deception and cut off the unsuspecting head. If I’m right, the trap won’t spring until I am killed.”
“How could they possibly know all that?”
“I believe they’ve been forwarned.”
“By who?”
“I have my suspicions.”
“But what about-”
“Sol’s breath, Mandri. Shut up for a moment!”
Mandri composed himself.
“Now, provided what I’ve said is true, that man has probably been told your description, and if he has, then he’s also been told that you’re the one who’s been carrying the Mazyd these long miles. He is going to try and get close to you to sniff me out. So please, for both our sakes, keep a good distance away from him.”
“What if he wants to shake hands?”
“Don’t.”
“Well, what am I supposed to say?”
“He knows who you are, so be honest, but twist it. Sprinkle the lie with grains of the truth. Say you’ve walked ahead of the others, and that they won’t be long behind. If he’s dumb, it’ll get him salivating.”
“What am I supposed to say if he wants to shake hands? I can’t just say no. That’s weird.”
“Mandri, improvise. You’ve a wit, so use it.”
“Alright,” Mandri said. He enjoyed the sense of 
“And one last thing,” Obo said. “What’s your favorite word?”
“I don’t have a favorite word.”
“Pick one at random.”
If Mandri was going to pick a favorite word, it wasn’t going to be at random. It was going to be a word that he liked, a bubbly word, fun to say, a word the captured something of his verve, and his taste for the divine, a word that, when spoken, could turn heads, and end all debate.
“My favorite word is Mandrameen”, he finally said.
Obo tsked, his voice threaded with a snarky gilt. “Pride is so repulsive. Especially in a human. At least when a lizard puffs its chest it does it because it knows its small.”
“It’s not about pride.”
“Whatever you say, Mandrameen.”
“Why’d you even ask?”
“Because when I’m ready to fill these heathen’s heads with the good word of Solraheen, I shall warn you first by saying your name. And when I say it, do not move. I can’t stress this enough - Do. Not. Move. Don’t crouch, don’t cringe, just stay perfectly still. You’re going to want to fling yourself about in terror, but if you don’t stand still, it’s going to mess everything up.”
Mandri glanced once more at the man. The frenzied whispering hadn’t ‘woken’ him up. There was little chance the had even reached him above his soaring snores.
“I’m excited,” Mandri said.
“You should be terrified. And remember,” Obo whispered. “Keep away from -”
“I know, I know,” Mandri said. “Keep away. Don’t move. I got it.”
Mandri chuckled at Obo’s harrumph, and then he stepped out the shadow of the canyon and walked towards the boulder and cannibal, keeping a steady, congenial smile. When he was near enough to formalize a greeting, he waved, but the man did not stir.
“Hullo there, sleepyhead!” Mandri said. Indulging the man’s deceit gave him a sense of control.
 The man snorted to with a fright, then looked up at Mandri and shaded his brow with an open hand.
“Hello, friend!” he said.
This close, Mandri could tell that the man was much younger than he imagined, perhaps not much older than himself.
“Happy to see ye,” the young man said, though he didn’t at look it, for his lips were still locked in that squinting sneer, his buckteeth gleaming in the sun.
“Same,” said Mandri, and he flashed a congenial smile.
The man shuffled his legs under him, a kind of frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his top-heavy pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up. Mandri was impressed.
“Name’s Greskal,” the man said. He held out his hand for Mandri to shake.
“I’m Mandri.” Mandri gave a curt wave, wrapped his thumbs under his pack’s straps.
Greskal looked at Mandri like he’d . He said, “Take it you scared as I to walk alone in this Pass.”
“This is the Goree.” Mandri said. “Why should I be scared?”
“Then you ain’t heard them rumors that the Goree is a gamble, ‘ave yah?”
“What rumors?”
“They say these days is tainted, say foul ilk breed in these hills, wearin’ in the skins of men. Was hopin’ somma like you’d pass me by. Don wanna head anymore east on my own. You is headed east?” 
He was looking at Mandri with expectant eyes. 
“Headed to Jeket.”
“Of course’n you’re headed to Jeket. Everybody’s headed to Jeket. I’m headed to Jeket, too. Got freshly spooled yarn needs sellin’.” He turned a little to show of his pack, giv. “Maybe I could take up with you?”
Ayram glares.

Ayram grunted. Smirked.
“Not a wrestler, then. Well don’t tell me, I’d like to guess. Me? I’m a mercenary, believe it or not. Hired sword for.”
“Put that away.”
“Of course, of course. I’d never dream of trying to battle a man your size. I just wanted to show you. It’s basically brand new.”
Tucks it into his scabbard. Sliced the webbing in his thumb.
“Ach!”
A little trickle of blood onto the sand swept ground. Tore a from his sleeve and wrapped his hand.
“Forgive me. I just haven’t seen anyone in a while and when that happens I get excitable. Overstep boundaries, you know. My name is Greskal, by the way.” He bowed his head.
“Greskal…” Ayram mused. “Well, Greskal, I think it’s best if we part ways.”
Bewildered. Looked east, then west.
“How?” he asked. “There’s only the one way, and you don’t own it. Can’t I walk where I please?”
“You can. Just know that as soon as we get out of the pass, I’ll kill you if you’re still in my shadow.”
“We’ll part ways once we leave the pass, okay?”
Ayram began again to walk. Greskal followed.
“What’s with the dour bunch back here? Are you folks mute, or what?”
“We have nothing to say to you,” grumbled Elrahet.
“Well I’ve some things to say to you,” Greskal said, impersonating Elrahet’s growl, amusing himself as he did. “Like, isn’t it funny that outside this pass you can kill to your heart’s content, but inside you can’t? Like there’s a magical line in the sand that determines good and evil. Just seems absurd to me. Morality doesn’t depend on where are, right? Like, ‘Stand here and killing is good, but do it two feet to the left, and Solraheen will damn your Spark to Shis.’ ”
“I don’t know,” Mandri said, “It kinda makes sense to me. Like what if-”
“Mandri!” Moto snapped.
“Is he not allowed to talk?
“No, he’s not,” said Moto.
“Why are you allowed to… What is that!?” Greskal cried. He was pointing at the swaddled Mazydobo.
Moto answered, “It’s the boy’s cripple brother.”
“Why’s he all pale like that?”
“A disease of the skin.”
“Don’t look human.”
Ayram stopped the line, stepped out, and beckoned Greskal with an impatient finger. “Come here,” he said.
“What for?”
“Because I said come here.”
“Look, let’s just keep on walking, shall we? I’ll be quiet, I promise. Just want the safety of numbers, is all. Like I said, there’s creatures out here.”
“Cut the shit.” said Ayram. The menace in his voice was nothing compared to the metallic chinnk of his iron bar thudding against ground.
“Cut what shit?” said Greskal. 
“Tell your men to come on out.”
Ayram pointed behind him with his thumb. High up on the northern ridge was a boulder that looked like a shark’s tooth, and out from behind it, like a weed, poked the wooden limb of a recurved bow.
A pregnant silence filled the red-rock valley, then a brusque, unintelligible whisper sounded out from the rocks above, and the wooden bow-tip was tucked out of sight.
Greskal shouted, “You know we can see you, right?”
A snarled retort sprang from unseen heights. 
“You can’t see shit!”
Greskal laughed, then cupped his mouth and shouted, “You’ve botched it!”
A black, turbaned head sprouted up from the boulder above and shouted back, “I didn’t botch nothin’! You botched it!”

Greskal looked to Ayram and asked, “Who gave it away, me or him?”
“Do you put this show on for every traveler you rob, or is this the first time? I’ll tell you this, two men ain’t going to cut it with me.”

Greskal sighed, walked over to the southern slope, and dropped his heavy pack. As he stretched his back, he said, “Your faith in Solraheen must be strong.”
“You going to kill us, or just take our things?” Ayram asked.
“I think you have the wrong idea,” said Greskal.
“Do I?”
“Schisol’s kin have been flocking eastward of late. So, I devised this plan to sniff them out, you see, they can’t resist easy meat.” He presented himself with open palms. “I show myself as a lonesome traveler, and when they reveal themselves for the monsters they are, my men riddle them with arrows.”
“Two men ain’t gonna cut it.”+
Greskal a shrill whistle that stood the hairs of Mandri’s neck on end. Twenty men rose up on either slope.
“Usually works like a charm, but seeing as you have a keen mind, I’m left with a conundrum: how do I know whether or not you’re a demon? Because you sure as shis look like you’ve been feasting on tainted flesh. And that creature on the boy’s back is certainly not natural either.”
Mandri felt Obo stir in the litter.

Problem:
We have multiple things at once:
Obo/Riga issue.
Tied to Seb issue.
Demons outside
The Amalgamete


Put time pressure.
Get ‘trapped’.




	- They underestimate the scale of the issue. - I’ve killed demons before.




	- Greskalun aren’t here if they’ve let demons move in.

	- really need to nest this earlier - a conversation about demons. Demons do exist. 
			- not a conversation - an experience with a stray demon.
				- see a dead demon.
	*** Replace lizard biting Mandri with a demon biting Mandri.
	
- obo didn’t want to kill it????

Mandri sees obo - confirm.	
They find a cave complex - deserted, as expected.
Post a watch - overviews the path
One hole in the ground. Mountains crawling with demons. Like a swarm of ants. silent
Seemingly can’t find them.
Torches. Hrks get slaughterd. Torches snuffed out.
Ayrams is like. “Inside!”
Elrahet says “The nature of our quest is changed. There is a shulgi here. We must find and kill it.”
Seb - 
Where is the Riga.
Open your mouth.



The flee into the cave interior.
Moto in front - we head for the backways.

Barricaded in dark throneroom.
Pull obo and the riga out of the pack.
Booming voice - “Here sooth the blechking”
Fight begins. 
Ayram is eaten.

            <Title>AmbushScrap</Title>
            <Text>It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.
More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Seb found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all. 

Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Seb could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.
Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Seb expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.
Seb would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn’t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers’ turbans. They were each, to a man, Skelsi. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.
Seb's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Seb felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.
By the time the middle of column had reached Seb’s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.
 The dead rider’s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 
So began the battle.
Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Seb had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. 
Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.
 An officer’s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Seb. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. 
They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.
Seb eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party’s arrows from whittling them down one by one.
Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his hands began to glow.
Seb notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. 
Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. 


CRACK-BOOM!

A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Seb back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. 
Then things went black.

Fish shit gets lost in the water.

Were you in any battles
A few
 Teach me that shit
No its not relevant 

Im something of an artist. We both are trying to get at the human heart, but I’m a little more - I’ll use the word ‘direct’.

Offal - innards.
This isnt offal. Offal is a prepared meal. This is just raw intestines.

No I can’t use swords. I use knives. I get mad and ill break a sword.


Almost everybody thinks that what they do is the most important thing in the world. The librarian thinks they’re guarding knowledge. A book on the shelf is The last stand against darkness. The comedian. The king thinks that if he did not exist, society would crumble. The leisure thinks that if they don’t enjoy life, then no one is. 



Bullo 
“So, you’ve got to get thinking about it. When you don’t have the time to work hard, you’ve got to work smart. So let’s get you thinking about it. First, you got to define your goal. What is your goal in a fight with blades?”
“Survive.”
“Ha! That’s right! Usually folk say, ‘stab him in the gut!’, but that discounts a perfectly viable strategy in any battle: simply run away.”
“I can do that.”
“And you should! Always run away, if you can. I’m not just saying that because you’re you. If you pulled a blade on me, I’d run away. If it came down to it, a fight between you and I, I’d kill you a hundred times out of a hundred, but I’d still prefer run away.” 
“Why?”
“Because swords are gods-damned sharp, Pyetle. Doesn’t take much for a blade like that to find the bone. Doesn’t take much for rot to find the smallest wound, either.”
“But if you beat me a hundred times out of a hundred…”
“A hundred times out of a hundred, yes. But a thousand times? A hundred thousand? I’m sure you’d get lucky in a few of those. The point is that there’s always risk and it’s never worth taking if you can just run away. I’ve seen men as skilled as the caliphants of legend get stabbed in the belly by raw recruits. It happens. Happens more often when you’re getting long in the tooth. You understand, eh? You and me, we can’t get away with things we used to.”
“Well I don’t think I need a lessons in running away.”
Bullo chuckled.
“Sure. Sure. But in the event that you can’t run away, the goal has to become clearer than simply surviving.”
“Kill my enemy before he kills me.”
“So bloodthirsty. You could settle for incapacitate.”
“I suppose I could.”
“You must consider that many killing blows don’t kill quickly. There’s only a few reliable spots that will end a duel rightly. The heart,” He pounded his chest. “And the head.” He tapped his skull. “Of course you’ve got to consider armor in all this. It’s why Drekkan Socars wear breastplates and helmets and not much else. I’ve heard Drekkan Commissars say that the reason they don’t outfit their troops with more protection is because there’s not enough iron to go around, but really it’s because the Drekkan king can afford to lose a man so long as he takes an enemy down with him.”
“Thats inconsiderate if of the Drekkan king.”
“When a Drekkan soldier’s life gets cut down to minutes, he’s taught to spend them with reckless abandon, to do whatever he can to make sure the enemy whose blade is stuck in his belly goes down with him. You might not believe it, but they’ve got a whole discipline that teaches them how, if you get cut down this way or that, sword or spear, what’s the best thing to do to get ‘em back.” The Drekkans can afford to think like that. They can afford one-for-one trades.”
“But Jandrians are mostly known for slings and arrows. .”
“The Drekk can afford twenty-for-one trades. That, and they’ve got these things called shields…”
“Right.”
“Anyways, the point is, it’s much easier to incapacitate, and then you can do what you will…. Eventually, if we ever get there, you’ll learn enough that your goal will become to simply take what your opponent gives you. Every style and stance is presenting something as a target. But for now let’s just say our target is the sword arm. Generally speaking, its the closest part of the enemy to your blade, it is the enemy’s threat, and if struck down the threat is nullified.”
“There’s three parts to an arm: the shoulder, arm, and hand.” He tapped each part as he was wont to do.
“The hand is simple. It’s basically just a bundle tendons and bone. If it gets cut almost anywhere, prettymuch, then the hand goes to shit. If I can’t grip my sword, you’re going win.”
Pyetle nodded. 
“The hard part about the hand is that its a small target that moves quickly. The shoulder however, is tied to the body’s core, and moves slowly. If I hack your shoulder here,” He patted the meat of Pyetle shoulder, “You won’t drop your sword, but you won’t be able to raise it. You’ll still be able to stab with it, but swinging is out of the question. So remember that: hit the shoulder and he can still stab. Of course, if you get lucky and sever the nerve here, then the whole arm goes to shit.”
“I’d be lucky just to land a single blow.”
“Sure, sure. I know this is a lot to take in, but these things need to be rolling around in your brain. When the time comes, you’ll see, the mind has a way of digging these things up. Just remember the key things at least: Sword arm,” he patted his own right arm. “Close but fast,” he held up his hand. “Far but slow.” He held the shoulder.
“What about the rest of the arm?”
“The rest arm’s a funny thing. Before we get into it, we’ve got to touch a bit on the art of swordplay.”
“Nothing artful about killing.”
“When I say art, I mean a way of thinking about solving problems. It’ll be easier to compare it to something more familiar, like music. In music there is only one thing: the single note. In painting its a single brushstroke - you take this one thing, and you put a bunch of them together to form something a more complex. In swordplay it’s no different. The single thing is the pose. String them together and you’ve got movement. It’s much like dance.”
“No it isn’t. I’ve seen women dance, and I’ve seen men fight. One is a planned display of beauty, the other is nothing but a rude, chaotic frenzy until one gives a brusque heave and dies.”
“You wouldn’t judge the entire art of painting from a child’s scribblings, would you? No.”
“They were two lorldy princes.”
“You’re point?”	“Surely they were trained in your art from the womb.”
“If you ever find yourself in a suit of armor fighting similarly armored prince, then I’ll be sure to give you  a lesson in that brutish form. In the meantime, you need to be thinking about it like this - thinking about the aspects of the form. In music there is melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, how loud or soft it is, and every single note of the composition affects all of these aspects simultaneously. That’s the important thing. If you want to compose a song, you need to be thinking about how the next note you place is going to affect not just the melody, but also the harmony, the rhythm, the texture, the loudness, and more. If you’re song sounds bad, and you don’t know the aspects of a note, you’re not going to be able to make your song much better. You might fiddle around for a little bit, but you won’t make much progress. You certainly won’t make anything interesting. That’s what this brand of thinking gives you: a framework to help you creatively solve unique problems.”
“I’m following.”
“Again, it’s the same with all art forms. You paint a painting, with every single brushstroke, you’re making a statement about color, about edge, value, and more. If you’re a painter you need to be aware of those aspects, because you’re going to make a bad painting, and you need you a way of thinking about it to fix it, or else you’re just fiddling around. It same in a fight. If you’re in a fight and you’re just fiddling around,  being ‘rude and chaotic’ as you say, then you’re going to have a bad time.”
“That’s all well and good,” Pyetle said, “but I am an old, old hat. ”
“Well let me finish now that I’ve gotten started.”
Pyetle laughed. “Okay. Yes, continue.”
“So what are the component parts of a duel? It’s these: distance, timing, balance, momentum, risk, and most importantly, the opposition.”
“Indeed.”
“Every movement you make affects all of these things simultaneously. I take a step towards you, and I am changing the distance. I am playing with risk. I have shifted my center of balance. I am changing momentum because with this step, whatever actions come next must flow from it. After it all, perhaps during, you will react.”
“You can’t possibly be thinking about all these things. Not in the middle of a duel. There’s no time.”
“These and more. Really theres no end to the aspects of any art, because after all, it’s all made up. Just stick with the basics, drill them, and you’ll be competent enough to hold your own.”
“Can’t you just show me a few moves?”
“It’s an art, Pyetle.”
“An art? I’m not trying to express myself here. My aim is to survive.”
“I know. But ‘a few moves’ aren’t going to keep you alive. You need to be able to react to whatever is going on. To do that you need to be able to solve novel problems. Creativity, Pyetle. Creativity is what will keep you alive. To be creative, you need to be thinking critically about what it is you’re doing. That’s what art is, that is what fighting is; creative problem solving. You need to be thinking this way and so we’ll practice it. Now stand up.”







“ , you’ve won if you can bring your blade to a narrower angle than the opponent. Because that means you’ve got a quicker path to the belly. 
So, let’s just stand here , sword to sword. 
Pytele copies the pose
So here, we’re even. Now if I pull my sword to swing, you’re winning. One step and stab and I’m dead. If I take a step back, and out of your range, it doesn’t matter. This is the first beginner lesson: you start the swing out of range, finish it in range. If you’re going to give the opponent the angle advantage, then stay out of range. Like so
Alright, back to the the start. One way of gaining advantage might be to simply knock the opponents sword, like so:
My sword’s on the line, yours isn’t, so I’ve won. But theres an easy counter, I’m sure you can think of it. Yes, you can simply move the sword out of the way, but you’re moving the sword off the line. You’re giving it up without me hitting it. 
A practiced swordsman will know all the moves, all the tricks and traps. So if you run into one, your best bet is to simply maintain a safe distance. You should run, if the mood calls for it.
How do I know if my opponent is skilled?
Oh, you’ll know in an instant whether or not your opponent knows about the line, about distance. The number of men I’ve killed with their sword out to the side like this, mid swing, its absurd. It’s like they’ve got this thought that if they start their swing first, that means I’ve got to parry it. It doesn’t enter their minds that I could just take a step forward, close the distance myself, and then stab them.

But if enemy know about distance, about the line, you should probably run. Everyone else, the mere fact that you’re considering it means your much more likely to win. And this is the thing about fighting - about everything really - it’s more about knowledge and experience than your god-given physical tools. I’m one of the smallest in the Ayramun, but no one here would fight me.


Strength, agility, these only come into play in bouts of similar skill.

Keep your hand like the head of a hawk.  Always pointed towards its prey. Nomatter how the body moves, keep it pointed towards the prey.

Stab instead of slash.  Stab - less of the arm is exposed to the enemy than a slash. Stab requries less energy. Is easier to perform in tight formation as it limits possibility of wounding allies. A slash is more likely to be stopped by armor or bones, difficult to land a lethal blow. With a stab, a cut no deeper than 2 inchens can be lethal.
Stabbing saves a lot of force.

STAMINA - use heavier training tools to increase muscle growth. 

Daily practice vaulting on and off a horse.

            <Title>Mandri</Title>
            <Text>Many people struggle against attempts to define who they are, but for artists, artists in Mandri’s vein, wriggling out people’s expectations is something of a state of nature. People couldn’t tell him who he was or what he was good at. He’d only listen to himself, and what he’d say, just as he said now while sitting there on the sand, is this: 
“Whatever you think you are, Mandri, you’re not.”
And for any artist who takes themselves seriously, that belief is almost a practical necessity, especially for someone chasing skill. Mandri knew that if he ever started to think that he’d become a master of the craft, he’d be finished. He’d stop growing. He’d stop getting better. True mastery, in principle, is impossible to achieve, for mastery implies that everything is known, everything is considered, and the objectively decision has been found. Absurd. There is always something unknown. The truth, as Mandri saw it, was that every artist, every person, is a blur of both mastery and ignorance; some more of one, some more of the other, and the frustrating thing about that blur is that it moves. And that is what a human being is, a blur of movement. Mandri’s portraits could never do it justice.</Text>

The precious load inside the oak case included nearly six hundred gold coins known as solidi. These jangled against fifteen thousand silver siliquae and a couple of handfuls of random bronze pieces. The coins were stamped variously with the faces of emperors from three dynasties, the mostrecent of them the ill-fated usurper Constantine III. Nestled among the coins were even greature treasures: an assortment of gorgeous gold necklaces, rings, and fashionable body chains designed to cling to the curves of a slender young woman’s body.; bangles etched with geometric patterns and lifelike hunting cenes; teaableware including silver spoons and pepper pots in the shape of wild beasts, ancient heroes, and empresses; elegant toilet utensils including silver earwwax scrapers and toothpicks mad e to look like long-necked ibises; bowls beakers, and juigs; and a tiny elephant-ivory pyxis - the sort of…

Virgil - on rome -  pardon the defeated, and battle down the proud.

The Typical Roman soldier signed on to serve for at least ten years; prior to the third century A.DS. The prize for serving in the auxiliaries for twenty-five years was full roman citizenship. Regular pay wwas reasonable, whil the roles available were many and varied. Besides infantry - trained to fight with a short sword; long, curved shield; and javelin - the roman army employed horsemen, artillerymen, medics, musicians, clerks, and engineers. There was a strong culture of reward and honor for distinguished service, but by the same token, discipline was brutally strict, proceeding by starvation, flogging and on occasion summary execution. According to the greek writer polybius, who composed a detailed history of rome in the second century bc, soldiers who failed to stand their ground in battle coudl be punished by fustuarium supplicum, in which their colleagues jointly cudgeled or stoned them to death.

Rome was a slave state - african grain mills, spanish mines. Apuleius - Their whole bodies picked out with livid weals, their whip-scarred backs shaded rather than covered by their tattered rags, some with only a scanty loin-cloth by way of covering… There were branded foreheads, half-shaven heads, and fettered ankles; their faces were sallow, their eyes so bleared by the smoky heat of the furnaces that they were half blind.

Economically, the entire edifice of rome and its empire relied upon mass bondage, facilitated by the same long and complex trading networks that supplied the empire with essential commodities and luxury goods.

The streets would be laid out in grid fashion. In the smareter sections of town, torches might be burning in the courtyards of the sprawling villas occupied by the wealthiest inhabitatnts fine homes built in brick or stone complete with underfloor h eating, a clean water supply, and floors and walls decorated in a distinctive mediterranean style with nods to classical greece and ancient rome. Toward the center of the city, an open space known as a forum would hold a marketplace and a clutch of official buildings 


Then, in the mid-third century they were persecuted en masse. The really programmatic pursuit of christians began under emperor decius, who took umbrage at general christian refusal to take part in a series of pagan sacrifices that he had ordered for the good of the empire during the crisis of the third centurey. Under decius, and later, under valerian *253-60) and Diocleation, christians were flogged, flayed, thrown to wild beasts, and martyred  in many inventive ways. Diocletian was remembered as a sadist, and his cruelty provided lurid material for later christian writers like Eusebius of Caesarea,

&gt; Women were tied by one foot and hoisted high in the  air, head downwards, their bodies completely naked without a morsel of clothing, presennting thus the most shameful, brutal and inhuman of all spectacles to everyone watching. Others again were tied to trees and stumps and died horribly; for with the aid of machinery they drew together the very stoutest boughs, fastened one of the marty’rs legs to each, and then let the boughs fly back to their normal position; tus they managed to tear apart the limbs of their victims in a moment.

COnstantine pg. 31

In turn, christianity underwent its first wave of romanization, developing a distinct military tone, a preference for latin as the language of exegesis, a network of ‘diocese’ (the name was borrowed, ironically, from Diocletian, once the arch-persecutor, who had in his day divided the empire into secular diocese for ease of administration. 
Edict of Caracalla 212 ad when citizenship was radically redistributed in the provinces - turning point.

Juddered, split, almost collapsed, and then reforemd.

For those alert ot signs hidden in the fabric of the world, the roman empire’s collapse in the west was announced by a series of omens. In antioch, dogs howled like wolves, night birds let out hideous shrieks, and people muttered that the mperor should be burned alive. In thrace, a dead man lay in the road and fixed passerby with an unnerving, lifelike glare, until after a few days the corpse suddenl y disappered. And in the city of rom itself, citizens persisted in going to the theater, an egregious and insanely sinful pastime, which, according to one christian writer, practially invited the wrath of the almighty. Human beings have been superstitious in all ages, and we are especially good at adducing portents when we have hte benefit of hindsight. Hence the opinion of the historian ammianus marcellinus, who looked back on the end of the fourth century into which he was born and reflected that this was a time when fort une’s wheel, “which is perpetually laternating prosperity and adversity,” was turning fast.

            <Title>Seculla Grain</Title>
            <Text>Bin Habeet hunched over the open ledger. He scanned each line with his finger, hoping to find a number and a date that would relieve the pressure of the dreaded ‘End of Month Dues’. He’d already been through half a stack of this year’s accounts, but there wasn’t anything in them that he could fudge. He was already operating at the edges of reality and even so he wasn’t sure he’d break even. As things stood there wouldn’t be enough to match the interest on his loans.
Debt was looming on the horizon, and today was the last day he could do anything about it.
The candle sitting on his desk was flaming out so he lit another. Bin had picked this windowless closet to be his office because the close darkness helped him focus. Out in the light of day his mind had a habit of wandering off. The downside of this closet was that it was comfy-cozy. A simple yawn could lead to a nap without him even noticing.
He yawned. Then he rubbed his eyes and tried to shoo off the oncoming sleep by blinking.
He had to do something.
But what? But what? But what?
Bin shifted in his chair. His sides rubbed up against the closet’s narrow walls. How he’d gotten so fat under this mountain of stress, he did not know. But he had to block that worry out of his mind. He needed to focus. He needed to find the right spot in one of these ledgers to sneak in a sympathetic number. Maybe in the grain shipment logs. 
But even his men would joke about his belly. They shouldn’t. He paid them well. He took care of them. A little chuckle wouldn’t have bothered him if they’d included him in it. “I’m not a curmudgeon,” Ben told himself. But his boys would go behind his back and laugh at him. They said he spent so much time in his closet that he that he was taking on its dimensions. 
Bastards couldn’t appreciate that he was trying to figure out how to pay them a living wage.
Bin sighed, closed the ledger, and then took another from the stack.
This one was titled, “Grain, Months Bel through Filn”.
He opened it and started anew on page one of fifty. His stubby finger traced the lines as they recorded the output of his farms down south.
12th of Bel, 1231 bushels of wheat. 0 of Barley.
Each day the incoming shipments were less than the day before. An untimely summer drought had slimmed his profit margins.
15th of Bel, 925 bushels of wheat. 0 of Barley
Bin’s protuberant eyes stared in disbelief at the dwindling of his little empire, the one founded by his father. It was all right there in the clear, ignorant script of the Hrkan scribe. Crisp, black ink.
16th of Bel, 401 bushels of wheat. 0 of Barley. 
As he read he noticed the length of the next line in the blur. It was longer than the rest. He tried to will it to say something other than what he’d knew it would way. 
18th of Bel, 621 bushels of wheat. 0 of Barley. - Seized by order of Seculla, wife of Plentyman Desinor.
“Bitch!”
‘Bitch’ was the only word he’d say out loud in his closet office. That bitch had been plaguing his ledgers for over a year. Upstart whore who’d let her marriage out of whorriage go to her head.
He rubbed the spine of the book down flat with his fatty hand.
Then there was flurry outside his door. A knocking, an indistingushed shout and rustling. Bin was about to turn and yell for the boys to keep quiet, when the door to his little closet flew open and his man Palat stumbled in.
Palat was breathless. Nearly couldn’t “You said to come next time she does it.”
“She’s doing it!?”
“Yes sir.”
“Where? Has she gotten there yet?”
“No sir, she’s on the way. And she’s got another mob of shitters in tow. Headed for the barges docked at slips one to ten. ”
“Are you absolutely sure?”
“She’s got a few men there already.”
Bin pushed Palat out of the closet, shouting “Get out!” as he did.
The closet was a kitchen closet, and there was an open door from the kitchen to the alley. 
Jim stood up, retrieved his sword from the harness hanging off the door, and stormed outside. 

Makes it to the docs before Seculla and mob. Dispatch of a few advanced guard.
Starts barking orders to undock the barges and push them upriver, to garan’s place, ten in all. Down to the last one.
Who the fuck tied this knot?
Seculla and mob turn the corner.
Starts dumping the grain into water. Wheeling grain gulls and a swarm of fish.
Mob pulls up.

Seculla is like wtf you doin.
“I’d sooner offer it to the River than let it be taken by you. You didn’t work for this grain. This is my grain.”
“You don’t look like you worked for this.”
Seculla turned to the crowd and spoke louder so all could hear. “Doesn’t look like he worked for this, does it? They have fat bellies in the fields these days?”
The crowd groaned and spat.
“What is your name?”
“I’m not afraid of you. You have no cause to take my grain.”
“You’ve been selling grain for higher than the High price.”
“Horseshit.”
“Honestly, it doesn’t even matter, because here you are, dumping grain into the Hrk. I’ve seen it with my own eyes. Doing it to spite the hungry.”
“To spite you, you bitch!”
“Since you’ve seen to rob people of their rightful share, they’ll get it from your belly.”
“Pulls out 
“No, no no. Don’t just stab. Slice off the fat. Go on. Yes, good.”


Gets back in cart with Pella.
Pella is like, damn that was good. Slice off the fat. That will be echoing through the streets by day’s end.
When the idiot poured the grain into the river he gave me no choice.
I know.
I mean what the hell did he think I was going to do with a blood-rushed mob when they’d seen him do that.
I know, it’s perfect. Went as well as it possibly could have.
Would have been better if the people had something to eat.
You know what I mean. 
But now that its done, there’s more important business.

            <Text>The monuments erected to the dead belong in every country, like funeral customs generally, to a deeper stratum of the national consciousness than do openly expressed beliefs. This is, in fact, a phase of the general law that in the history of religion cultus is more venerable and more conservative than doctrine. And as, further, the beliefs which find an expression in literature are those of the most enlightened and the least conservative spirits, it is misleading if one attempts to learn from the higher literature of a people how the masses really think and feel in regard to death and the life which lies beyond death. 

For such reasons, it was the first and most important duty of an heir to see that the person whom he succeeded met with due burial. In war, as a rule, each side buried its own dead; and so great was the horror at neglect of this pious office, that after a drawn battle the side which was not in possession of the battle-field would commonly ask for a truce for the purpose of burying the slain, though it thereby acknowledged defeat. 

The friends grouped about her are all women, with hair cut short in sign of mourning, clad in garments of dark brown, green, or blue. The lady who stands at the foot of the bier and her neighbour place their hands on their heads in sign of grief; their dress is that of burgher ladies; no doubt they are the nearest relatives of the dead. The girl who stands at the head of the bier is a slave or hired attendant. She is more simply clad, and carries in one hand{4} a flapper or fan to keep off the flies, in the other a basket containing fillets or ribbons. A wreath hangs against the wall of the room. Three small, naked, winged idola hover in the air. They are doubtless spirits of the dead: but the motive for their presence is not clear. One might at first be disposed to regard them as merely ready to receive the departed spirit; the figure nearest to the mouth of the corpse might even be regarded as the soul which has just taken flight. But these views scarcely account for the attitude, which is clearly in each of the three idola a recognized sign of grief. In fact, the close resemblance of gesture between the lady who stands at the foot of the bier and the winged figure above her seems to show that they share the same feeling, which is one of sorrow.

How to get on in the world - A.R. Calhoun.

&quot;Instead of saying that man is the creature of circumstance, it would be nearer the mark to say that man is the architect of circumstance. It is character which builds an existence out of circumstance. Our strength is measured by our plastic power. From the same materials one man builds palaces, another hovels; one warehouses, another villas. Bricks and mortar are mortar and bricks, until the architect can make them something else. Thus it is that in the same family, in the same circumstances, one man rears a stately edifice, while his brother, vacillating and incompetent, lives forever amid ruins; the block of granite which was an obstacle on the pathway of the weak, becomes a stepping-stone on the pathway of the strong.&quot;

ADVICETOYOUNG MEN AND BOYS
A SERIES OF ADDRESSES
DELIVERED BY B. B. COMEGYSMEMBER OF THE BOARD OF CITY TRUSTS OF PHILADELPHIA
TO THE PUPILS OF THE GIRARD COLLEGE


He was a man of great industry and frugality, and lived comfortably, as the merchants of that day lived, in the dwelling of which his counting-house formed a part. He was married and had one child, but the death of his wife was followed soon by the death of his child, and he never married again. He lived to the age of eighty-one and accumulated what was considered at the time of his death a vast estate, more than seven millions of dollars. One hundred and forty thousand dollars of this was bequeathed to members of his family, sixty-five thousand as a principal sum for the payment of annuities to certain friends and former employés, one hundred and sixteen thousand to various Philadelphia charities,[10] five hundred thousand to the city of Philadelphia for the improvement of its water front on the Delaware, three hundred thousand to the State of Pennsylvania for the prosecution of internal improvements, and an indefinite sum in various legacies to his apprentices, to sea-captains who should bring his vessels in their charge safely to port, and to his house servants. The remainder of his estate he devised in trust to the city of Philadelphia for the following purposes: (1) To erect, improve and maintain a college for poor white orphan boys; (2) to establish a better police system, and (3) to improve the city of Philadelphia and diminish taxation. 


the corner-stone being laid with ceremonies on the Fourth of July following 

The auxiliary buildings include a chapel of white marble, dormitories, offices and laundries. A new refectory, containing improved ranges and steam cooking apparatus, has recently been added, the dining-hall of which will seat with ease more than one thousand persons. Two bathing-pools are in the western portion of the grounds, and others in basements of buildings. The houses are heated by steam and lighted by gas obtained from the city works. Thirty-five electric lights from seven towers one hundred and twenty-five feet high illuminate the grounds and the neighboring streets. A wall sixteen inches in thickness and ten feet in height, strengthened by spur piers on the inside and capped with marble coping, surrounds the whole estate, its length being six thousand eight hundred and forty-three feet, or somewhat more than one and one-quarter miles. It is pierced on the southern side, immediately facing the south front of the main building, for the chief entrance,[13] this last being flanked by two octagonal white marble lodges, between which stretches an ornamental wrought-iron grille, with wrought-iron gates, the whole forming an approach in keeping with the large simplicity of the college itself.
The site upon which the college is erected corresponds well with its splendor and importance. It is elevated considerably above the general level of the surrounding buildings and forms a conspicuous object, not only from the higher windows and roofs in every part of Philadelphia, but from the Delaware river many miles below the city and from eminences far out in the country. From the lofty marble roof the view is also exceedingly beautiful, embracing the city and its environs for many miles around and the course, to their confluence, eight miles below, of the Delaware and Schuylkill rivers.

their predominant sentiment, the jealousy over their women, points back to the strict seclusion of the harem. 

It is both unnecessary and invidious to descant upon “Don Quixote,” par excellence the work of Spanish Humour. 

N a certain convent there was a cat which had killed all the mice in the convent but one, which was very big, which she could not catch. The cat mused in her heart in what manner she might deceive the mouse that she might kill him; and thought so long till she agreed she must take the veil, and clothe herself in nun’s garb, and sit amongst the nuns at table, and then she might get at the mouse; and she did as she had thought. The mouse, when he saw the cat eating with the nuns, rejoiced greatly, and thought, since the cat had become religious, that she would henceforth do him no harm, insomuch that Don Mouse came near to where the nuns were eating, and began to leap about here and there. Then the cat rolled her eyes as one who has no longer eyes for any vanity or folly, and she kept a peaceful and humble countenance; and the mouse, seeing that, drew near little by little; and when the cat saw him nigh her she sprang upon him with her claws and began to throttle him. And the mouse said, “How is it that thou, a nun, art so cruel as to wish to kill me?” Whereupon the cat replied, “Think not thy cries will cause me to free thee; for know, brother, that when it pleases me I am a nun, and when it pleases me a canoness.”

            <Text>Mandrameen had never been raised from the dead before. If he had known such a thing was possible, then perhaps he would have noticed how it felt to be reinserted into Nature’s causal flow. It is a sublime sensation, a staticky prickling at the edges of the subconscious as the Divine Spark reasserts its grip on the body. The Ayramun call it ‘Sheldruub', which is an Old-Jandri word for the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets blown inland during a world storm. Entire beaches get covered six feet deep in that salty brown foam. When the storm passes and the sun peeks out, the air gets filled with the white noise of a hundred trillion foam bubbles popping. It’s not loud, it’s just there and ever-present under the familiar sounds of nature; the wind blowing and the waves crashing and the gulls cawing overhead. When the foam disappears so does the static and all that’s left is solid ground.
 Mandrameen didn’t notice the Sheldruub. And he didn’t notice the warm blood tickling his insides back into working order. No, he was wholly preoccupied with the certain fact that he was dead and that this was the afterlife. All the other surface sensations pointed towards the fact that he was a cold corpse. The skin on his shoulders shivered and the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. His nose was numb and his lips were cracked and stinging. On top of it all, there was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. It was the exact same smell that ruined his every summer, because the space under the floor of his bedroom was a popular destination for old rats looking to die. He wasn’t allowed to throw out their stinking corpses because he’d have to tear up the mosaic floor to get at them. His father told him he could either endure the smell or sleep outside, but the first night Mandri slept outside, the summer spawn of gilt flies got at him. When he woke up, half his face was covered in hard, red welts the size of fingernails; the other half had been safely nestled in his pillow, so he looked like he’d been slapped in the face by disease. So, the only real option was to endure the smell, and endure it he did. This is not to say that he got accustomed to it. The smell of death was always dreadful, always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.
Then there was the uncomfortable fact that he could not move. Dead things don’t move.
Yet, he could breathe, and dead things don’t breathe.
His breath was icy coming out of his throat.
He tried again to move but neither his legs nor arms would bend. It got to a point where he wasn’t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn’t truly feel them. He couldn’t even roll his body this way or that.
Just as he was coming to terms with the fact that his mind was decoupled from his flesh and his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing body, he found he could open his eyes. It was difficult thing to do as they were caked shut by the crust of slumber. They opened slowly, and Mandri was almost disappointed. As soon as they were wide enough to parse the caught a glimpse of where they were, he shut them tight again.
He was lying flat on a floor of a cave lit by flame. 
Surely, he thought, this is Shis.
He snuck another peek to make sure, and sure enough, it was a cave - a natural cave, not a quarry or mineshaft or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Zagros. The texture of the sandstone was a study in contradictions: it was smooth and craggy and porous all at once. The ceiling was low, and the walls bulbed out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others. 
There are stories that say that Shis is a giant pit under the earth where the blackness that is the soul is cleansed from the Spark by fire. In that pit is a tornado of flesh and flame and ringing out loud is a chorus of screams, the like of which can turn a man mad if he’s to hear it before his time. This didn’t quite fit that. For starters, it wasn’t a pit. And it wasn’t burning flesh he smelled, it was rotting flesh. He was trapped inside his own rotting body which was itself trapped inside a bubble of rock.
His mind’s eye conjured a different image of the Underworld. One where the rock under the earth is riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse, and everyone is forced to endure the mire of their own stench for eternity. It wasn’t a vision of the afterlife he’d ever been taught, but then again, he always supposed he’d never been taught the correct one.
Mandrameen summoned the courage to open his eyes again. This time he found he had the use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket and was lying on a bed of straw. He thought it was strange for such a place as the Underworld to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of the flame, and was relieved to see that it wasn’t a jet of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth, it was a regular copper oil lamp sitting in the middle of this little cave. 
On the other side of that lamp, however, side-slumped against the limestone, was the most disturbing manlike creature Mandrameen had ever seen.
It was not human. It had arms and legs and the right skeletal structure, and its naked skin was pale and white like a Hrk’s, but the thing seemed as much like a giant hairless mouse. Mandri could count its ribs and the notches along its spine. It’s stomach was grossly distended, extruding out from its abdomen that it lolled over its scrawny thighs and onto the floor. Its chest was short and cramped and this drew the shoulders inward, giving the thing a hunched appearance, like it was better suited to walking on all fours, dragging its belly like a pregnant mouse as it went. Though its skin clung tight to its flesh, there wasn’t the slightest hint of a vein or artery anywhere. It was all sinew, skin, stomach, and bones. Mandrameen thought it was a ‘him’, but he wasn’t sure, for the creature’s groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of genitals. 
Mandri would have figured it for a ghoul if its face weren’t so smooth and fair. Its was reminiscent of an articulated mannequin that Mandrameen’s mother had given to him as boy, which was a wooden thing held together with copper wire and could hold a dynamic pose long enough to be drawn. The creature here in this cavern had a similar look - a generic Hrkan head, with even eyes, a straight nose, a thin mouth, all in symmetrical and genderless proportion. Its expression was identical to the wooden puppet, locked in a sterile stare. 
Thankfully, the thing wasn’t looking at him. It was preoccupied with the grievous wounds afflicting its body. Mandri could just make out a long line of stitches running down the middle of the creature’s chest, forming a suture that was caked in blood. Two stitches at the bottom had burst, leaving an open slit just below the sternum - but that wasn’t even the worst of it, for the creature’s hands had been cut off at the wrists. In their place were blood-stained poultices wrapped tight with cotton bandages. The hands themselves, spindly and long-fingered, were sitting in a far corner of the cave, one stacked on top of the other, like a pair of gloves ready for work.
It was some kind of ghost, Mandrameen was sure. It was either one of Moon’s creatures, or a fallen star. Or, Mandrameen feared, this was a human like him. This was what Mandrameen would become. All recognizable details that made Mandrameen, Mandrameen would be ground into oblivion. All laugh lines and moles and fleshy color and shaggy hair, it would all be cut out and smoothed over until all that is left is this expressionless puppet in the general shape a human being. 
If he were an architect of the Underworld, that was how he would do it. Those without virtue should find terror in its place, and an eon of terror would turn a person into this creature. And it made sense to heal the wounds after inflicting them. Mandrameen understood the power of contrast. He’d make sure it wasn’t all-torture all-the-time, because then the pain would lose its meaning. There would need to be moments like this of healing, of hope. He would go further than this, he would put moments of outright pleasure in. Such highs would make the lows, lower and make the terror more complete when its ripped away.
He’d also make sure the torture fit the crime. Like this creature here had clearly been a thief. Cutting off the hands was a common enough punishment up on the surface, perhaps down here all thieves were doomed to have their hands lopped off and then regrown and then lopped off again. 
The chest wound was a less obvious bit of imagery. The stitches ran over the heart so perhaps it was a crime of passion. Mandrameen didn’t think much of it because he was more concerned with what his own torture would be. With nothing to do but lay there and think, he thought long and hard about his sins. There weren’t many of them. Nothing at least to warrant being impaled on a spike or thrown into a lake of fire. 
His death was a suicide, but he didn’t think that was some unshoulderable sin. Who was he harming? His father hated him, his mother was dead, and no one else even knew he existed. Harming himself? Solraheen could not sit in judgment of a young man trying to find a bit of peace. If only the only way to find that peace was to hike out alone into the baking Sand, then what does that say about Solraheen’s creation? 
But everyone knows that suicides go to the Underworld. They don’t get buried. Their names are shushed and spit at. “How selfish” some people say, as if they want to do it too, but don’t out of a twisted sense of social obligation.
Mandri told a teacher once that he was going to do it. The teacher, a bald and wiry old man, gave him the dimensions of a square cistern and asked him to find how much land could a depth of 12 feet irrigate. Mandri said he’d rather kill himself than figure the answer. He said it with complete sincerity, and he was type of child who’d play with people like that on the way out. The old man saw it for what it was, called Mandri a petulant child and slapped him hard upside the head. He threatened to do it again if the boy dared to make light of the gift of life. 
Now that was a problem Mandri wanted to figure out. That old man honestly thought that beating a suicidal kid would do some good.
How?
Why?
If Solraheen truly wanted to torture him, the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like his teacher, people who have no conception of what it’s like to live in someone else’s skin; the truly selfish bastards, abusive old folk, violent assholes, doctors who reduce destructive emotions to mere tremors of bile in the stomach (take a bit of mari leaf, Mandri, and you’ll feel right as rain). Ignorant, dumb, vain people. And oh, don’t worry, Mandri counted himself among them. He was as much a ‘people’ as anyone, but at least he had the good sense to admit it. 
This wasn’t the surface, though, and this creature across the cave certainly wasn’t his old teacher. In such a case, Mandri could think of only one other punishment that would be ‘on-theme’ with suicide: he would be made to hurt himself. 
Somehow this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own head into a lake of fire. There was an infinite class of willful deaths for an artist of the Underworld to play with. Only, Mandri wasn’t sure how they’d get him to do it. He wasn’t some Solean penitent who took special delight in the ‘cleansing awe of pain’. He might be forced to ingest some mind-controlling substance, or be strapped into a hellish contraption of iron, knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him stab himself. 
If he even had an arm to bend.
He looked back down at his body. There were forms under the blanket where his arms should be. Then he saw his fingertips sticking out from under the sides, and like what happens in a dream, as soon saw them and knew that had them, feeling flooded into them. Suddenly, he had arms.
He threw the blanket off and saw that his whole body was more or less how he’d left it; a little bruised but it was all there and functioning, not black and rotting. He could wiggle his toes. And he was still dressed in his blue tunic, which was still dusted red from the clay of the Hias road.
He looked over at the ghoulish creature and the thing’s eyes were on him now. It seemed surprised. Mandrameen wondered if he was supposed to do something, speak to the creature, but decided the best thing to do was to try and see if there was a way out of this place. 
He stood up, slow and deliberate, hands showing, careful not to make any sudden movements. He felt his way along the sandstone towards his right.
After a few steps he could see that the rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri went back to his left, keeping close to the rock, staying as far as he could from the pale creature that was watching him with curious intent. 
To his left, hidden from the flickering lamplight, was a wide crack and what seemed like an opening that he could shimmy through. He put his arm into it, and his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his straw bed.
There was only one way left to explore. There was a patch of darkness near the creature, a spot where sandstone bent backwards and the weak lamplight could reach. Mandri’s eyes strained to see if there were a glimmer of rock, or if the darkness really did go all the way back.
The creature shook its head. 
Then it spoke. Its voice was shockingly clear, free of the rankling pain it must be feeling. 
“There’s no way out that way,” it said. “There is an opening that leads up, but it is not something you can fit through. Just another cranny for bats.”
“Bats?” Mandri asked. The word flew out of his mouth without him realizing.
“Yes. Bats,” the creature said. 
It pointed up with the stub of its arm.
Mandri looked up. There, clinging to cracks in the rock ceiling, were a dozen or so furry black blobs. Bats. No bigger than the palm of his hand. He’d never seen their kind before. He’d only heard stories about them, mostly creation stories, like how Mid summoned creatures out of the night to haunt the skies, and out came bats. 
One of them dropped from its spot and flew into the unexplored passageway, silent as the darkness which swallowed it up. 
Mandri closed his gaping mouth.
Wanted to walk past. Would need a stiff bit of lumber lashed to his spine to keep him upright.
Best not to talk to a might-be-a-demon.
Best thing to do was sit right back down on that bed of straw, wrap that blanket around his shoulders, and pray that it was all a dream, or else pray for deliverance.
Mandri crept back along the wall to his spot of straw, back hunched, almost bowing in obeisance to the creature as he went. He knew now that it was no mere creature, and not a husk of a human being either. There was a depth in its eyes and it could speak, and there was even affectation in its voice, an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Most of all, despite its pitiful state - the scrawny frame, the bruises, the scar, the missing limbs - there was a liveliness in its spirit that outshone his own.
No, in this place, Mandri was the creature.
He sat down, made the blanket into a shawl, and tried to meet the creature’s eye. 
He couldn’t.
The creature saw him look away.
“I’m not going to hurt you. Not that I’d be able to. I don’t bear anyone ill will.”
Mandri pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders, and asked, “Are you a demon?”
The creature smiled. He had human teeth, flat, clean, white, and even, radiant even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs. But this meant nothing. He’d heard that some agents of the Dark wield beautiful, disarming smiles. Too ugly - demon. Too clean and perfect - demon. This one here was a mixture of the two; the body was a perversion of the human form, the head a .
“Why do you think I’m a demon?”
“Your body.”
“My body?”
“It is a perversion.”
“A perversion of what?”
“The human form.”
“Is it!? Nice to meet you, too. My name is Oro. What is yours?”
“I’m not going to tell you my name.”
“You’re under no obligation,” the creature Oro said, “but sharing one’s name is a friendly gesture.”
Mandri paused.
“And what would you do with it?”
“I would call you by it. What else does one do with a name?”
“Whatever it is demons do with names.”
“What power do you think a name has?”
Mandri shrugged. He’d heard stories. Some peoples keep their names hidden even from family. They walk around with clay cylinder’s around their necks that functioned as names.
“How about this,” Oro said. “Don’t tell me your name. What utterance should I make to grab your attention?”
“I don’t want you grabbing my attention.”
Oro leans forward. The hand was his own fault.
“You feel threatened. But what am I going to do? Amble over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? The horror. Please, friend, I look strange, I know, but get over it. I am not a demon.”
“I’m not going to tell you my name.”
“Then I will make up a name for you.”
“Go ahead.”
“I shall call you Chit.”
“Chit?”
“You look like a Chit.”
Mandri found it absurd. “What does a ‘Chit’ look like?”
“Mothers who love their sons a certain way name them Chit. Chitawar. Chitawareen. Pampered boys. They become dour boys. You’ve got that mousey look. I bet you think highly of yourself, don’t you?”
“Why in shis do people keep saying that.”
“Oh? You don’t?”
“Nobody one hates me more than me.”
“I find that hard to believe.”
“Believe what you will.”
“Unfounded certainty. So typical of a Chit.”
“I’m not a ‘Chit’.”
“Well, you’re Chit until you give me your name.”
Pause as Mandri is like, this dude is fucking with me.
“Fine. It doesn’t matter, call me what you want. There’s only the two of us here in this little hole in the Underworld. Call out any name you like, and I’ll be the only person to answer.”
“Again with the certainty. You think that there is only two of us down here. You are so certain of that. And - ah, yes, there’s that certainty melting away. Wonderful. You were so certain just then, and now you are beginning to think you might be wrong.”
Mandri looks around. If he missed the bats, maybe he missed something or someone else. He eyed the cleft of darkness that he’d been too afraid to check, the bit near Oro.
Oro smirked, and said. “No, he is not back there.”
“Stop playing games,” Mandri demanded.
“Then listen.”
“Listen for what?”
“Calm down, and just listen.”
Calm down. Moment of silence. Then Oro starts snoring. Arm stump directing the pitch in and out. Directing Mandri’s attention to the steady rhythm. Then he caught it, faintest of faint sounds, echoing out of the crack in the wall to his left.
“There’s someone out there.”
“Yes.”
“Who is it?”
“Our jailer, I suspect.”
“Is it a demon?”
Oro, bemused. “Not unless a demon’s snore sounds exactly like an underweight Jandri man who’s spent too much time chewing on karkle spines.”
“You can tell all that from just a snore?”
“Karkle juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that - you hear it? Gives the snore that wet, kind of sputtering lilt.” 
Oro leaned back against the rock. “Tell me, Chit, why do you think everyone down here is a demon? These bats, are they demons too?”
“Sure. Creatures of Lahoraheen. Creatures of the Dark. Natural for them to be roosting in the Underworld.”
“There’s that again, ‘the Underworld’. You don’t mean, the Underworld Underworld, do you?”
“Of course I do. Am I not dead?”
“Do you feel dead?”
“No,” Mandri said firmly. “But who is to say what being dead feels like. If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder - so then yes, I do feel dead.”
“You are not dead.”
“I am dead,” Mandri said flatly. “I remember dying.” 
“You were dead. At present you are very much alive.”
“I was dead?”
“Yes. I was asleep and you were dead. Then your heart started beating. It beat so loud that it woke me up.”
“You brought me back?”
“Oh I had nothing to do with it. To be honest, I did not know human hearts could restart.”
“They don’t.”
“So I believed. Yet, here you are.”
Mandri instinctively doubts that Oro could hear his heart, though he could hear the man snoring outside.
“So what are you then? Are you dead?”
“No. I’m not alive, either. I am, in the words of my master, ‘merely animated tissue’. Or more aptly, ‘Energized meat’.”
“You are a demon then!”
“What? No.”
“You talk of your master. You are neither alive nor dead. You are not human. You are serve the Dark God.”
“If by ‘Dark God’ you are referring to king of Hrk, then you are correct. But I think you are thinking of Lahoraheen, no? Ancient God of the night. Buried under the earth. Judge of the damned.”
“You serve the king of Hrk?”
“That it what I said, yes.”
The wheels start to turn. Perhaps.
“Are you one of the Mazydai?”
“I am indeed. Mazyd Oro is my full title. Just Oro to friends. Pleasure.”
“You lie.”
Oro laughed. 
“Again, Chit, you can’t reveal the of the truth of a matter through sheer certainty.” 
“How do I know you’re not lying? How do I know you aren’t a demon, and that the snore outside isn’t a demon. I died. I know that I died and you admit as much. Then I wake up in a cave underground filled with bats and a wretched creature who pesters me. You expect me to believe that this is not the Underworld? You expect me to tell you my name?”
“You really think this is the Underworld?”
“I do.”
“Why do you think that life after death should be so much like the regular old world? There’s an infinite class of cosmic realities and you think that when you die you go to… this? A dark hovel under the earth? Not a colorful explosion of , not a infinitely recursive pattern bluring the , no, when you die you go to a cave, the kind just like the. Let it never be said that the mind of a Chit lacks originality.”
“Then what is this place if not the Underworld?”
“The regular old world.”
“fuck off.
“You don’t believe me.”
“Believe a demon? No.”
“That’s okay. Don’t believe me, believe the bats.”
Contorted his face 

“These bats are not demons. They are simple bats, bush-tailed bats. You can tell from the way their wings attach to the spine instead of the sides, and, well, by the bushy tails.”
“So?”
“Do you know how many kinds of bats there are in Jandria? Hundreds. There’s more kinds of bats than there are kinds of dog, or cat. Or any other furry creature for that matter. Why should it be that there are bush-tailed bats in the Underworld, bush-tailed bats and not, say leaf-eared bats or black-tipped bats.”
“They’re just bats.”
“Tell me, Chit, where did you die?”
“What does that matter?”
“Just answer.”
“I died in the Sand.”
“Where in the Sand? Near the Junei Pass? The Eastern Hias?”
“Yes. But a demon would know that, wouldn’t he?”
“I know that because Bush-tailed bats live in the Hias. They sleep all winter and then they come out at spring to feast on the nectar of redberry blooms, and only redberry blooms. Unlike most bats, they aren’t opportunistic feeders. There’s only one place on the whole continent where redberry bushes grow - on the slopes of the Eastern Hias.”
“What’s you’re point?”
“You died in the Eastern Hias, and your body is still fresh so you couldn’t have been dead long, meaning your corpse couldn’t have been carried far. Then you wake up in an underground cave near some bush-tails, and bush-tails roost in the caves of the Pitted Portion, right next to the Junei Pass.”
“So?”
“What’s more is that you wake up next to me. I have no Divine Spark and so I cannot, by my very nature, die and go to the afterlife. Taken all together, is it not conceivable that you are not in the afterlife, that your dead body was found, brought down here, and then, through unknown means, brought back to life?”
“And who would have done all this?”
“I assume it was done by the same people who brought me down here.”
“And who are they?”
“Not entirely sure. I thought you were one of them until you opened your mouth. Haven’t seen them except from a distance. Thieves of , zealots of a kind, could be band outlaws. They laid an ambush for me on an old smuggler’s road, just outside the Junei Pass. There was a battle and somehow they overcame me. The last thing I remember is an explosion of rock. Then I woke up here, all cut up, like you see.”
“You were ambushed on a smuggler’s road? Was it Scuttle Road?”
“That is the one.”
“I died on Scuttle Road.”
Oro’s eyes widened for the first time.
“Did you get a look at your killer? Did you know them?”
“I said I died, I didn’t say I was killed.”
“Then how did you die?”
“I just… died.”
“Was it the heat? Thirst?”
“More or less.”
“Were you by yourself?”
“I was.”
“That seems foolish.”
“I was trying to die.”
“Oh. Well then,” Oro grunted. “Not foolish at all. You accomplished exactly what you set out to do.”
“And yet, here I am. Alive again. Or so you claim.”
“Yes, Chit, that is what I claim.”
Mandri chafed under the weight of Oro’s . No M
“See, a Mazyd lord wouldn’t be so petty. They are regal people, and you stoop to name-calling.”
“If you recall, not two fingers ago, you told me to call you any name that I like.”
“I did, but… but you didn’t have to be all snooty about it.”
“You insult my appearance. You call me a demon. You are unwilling to accept the truth of your situation. You are completely without empathy. As of now you’re deserving of nothing more than Chit.”
“If you’re one of the Mazydai, then prove it - spit golden fire.”
“I was recently robbed of that ability.”
“Then do something else.”
“We have only the one perceptible power. Other than the body, which you take for a demon’s, the only perceptible difference between me and you is that I am willing to accept when I am wrong.”
“Aren’t you supposed to know things that normal people don’t know?”
“We are learned creatures, yes.”
“What happens when a dies?”
“On that matter, there are conflicting reports, and to no one’s surprise, these reports are unreliable. I should ask you that question, seeing as you’ve been there.”
“I don’t remember anything of death. I died and woke up here. If I went anywhere while dead, then I don’t remember it.”
“Then perhaps that is how it is.”
“I don’t think so.”
“Why not? Why does death have to be different than an undreaming sleep?”
“Because people need to be punished for the things they did wrong.”
“Do they?”
“Yes.”
“Divine justice?”
“Yes.”
“The gods don’t seem too concerned about justice in this world, so I don’t see why they’d be concerned about it in the world hereafter.”
“Punishment is the only way it does make sense. If people can go and do whatever they want to other people and not face consequences…”
“Yes?”
“That would be horrible.”
“Horrible. Terrible. You might say, unjust.”
Mandri nodded.
“The only way that I could believe that this is isn’t Shis, that this is all real, is if this is my punishment. I went against the word of the Septuagint and committed the crime of self-harm. I tried to escape this world, and so, it would be fitting to send me right back. Poetic, in a way.”
“First you think the gods care about justice, now you think they care about poetry?”
Mandri sneered at Oro’s bigotry. “What do you know about the gods?” Mandri said. “You don’t even have a Spark.”
“You believe, then, that I am a Mazyd Oro and not a demon?”
“You know what I mean.”
Oro chuckled. “Well, you are right, I don’t know much about the gods. The one thing I do know, however, is to never assume that anyone thinks and feels the same way that I do about anything - and that holds true for gods especially.”
“That’s only true because you were not made in their image. Why should you think and feel as they do?”
“That is true, humans created me - and yet, I am nothing at all like you. There is some resemblance in physical form, but beyond that, I can assure you, the only thing we share is the capacity for language.”
“You seem human-like.”
“A moth seems leaf-like.”
“What does that even mean?”
“It means that - ah, hold on.”
Something unseen and unheard interrupted Oro’s thought. Mandri wondered what it could be. Oro closed his eyes. After a moment, he said in a hushed whisper, “There’s movement outside.”
From the way Oro’s head was cocked, Mandri supposed the movement was coming from where the snoring was earlier. Mandri held his breath and tried to listen in himself. He caught what he thought was the muffled of an argument. 
He made to crawl towards crack to get a better listen. Oro stopped him with a brusque, “Tsk!”
Mandri froze.
“There’s voices.”
“What do they say.”
Oro’ “Evidently our guard was supposed to be in here.” He smiled. “They suppose that we are both asleep.”
Mandri .
Oro saw the worry written in Mandri’s face. He said, “Should we humor them? Pretend to be asleep?”
“I’ll keep my eyes open, thank you very much.”
“Suit yourself,” Oro said. 
With that, Oro slumped up against the wall. Assumed the precise position he’d been in when Mandri saw him. So precisely the same, that Mandri began to wonder if the entire conversation he’d just had was only a dream. 
“And by the way, if it turns out that you’re wrong, and it’s not two demons stepping through that stone, then please, for me, soak your face in a bowl of beaten eggs.”
Then the sound of stone grinding against stone. Mandri looked to his left, hairs on his neck standing on end.
A short and stout Jandri man tumbled into the cave, and behind him came another who looked just like him, only a with a beard.
The first man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.
“The boy’s awake!” he shouted.
“Christ, Sob, I told you,” said the second.
“Don’t tell Ayram.”
“Oh, I’m telling Ayram.”
“Why? Nothing’s happened! Look! Look at him! Barely moved.”
The man with the torch glanced at Oro, who was feigning his fuge state.
“I won’t tell, but you’ve got to carry the Mazyd.”
“Fine by me. He hardly weighs more than a poke of tinder anyways.”

You pick up that Mazyd - make sure they mention that Oro is indeed a Mazyd. Moment where mandri is like, is that really a mazydai?

Swing around, torch almost brushing Mandri’s cheek.
“You! You don’t talk!”
“Wha-”	“No! No!”
The other man chimed in. Oro was slumped across his shoulders. “You’re among the Ayramun now,” he said. “You’ve got to earn the right to talk.”
“Nod or shake your head, that’s all you do. Nod or shake. You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Now boy, what the hell are you doing out here?”
Mandri 
“HA! He’s like a rat in a bucket.”
Leans in, eyes sizzling.
“Answer this, boy - what in the hell were you doing out here?”
Mandri did not know how to answer that by only moving his head. He didn’t know if he could answer it with words.



“What’d I say about flappin’ them lips? How’d you figure that meant you could spit piss in my general direction?” Bib tsked at Mandri’s insolence. “You break the rules you get what’s comin. That’s how it be in the Ayramun.”

Moteah and Moto
Moteah - cruelty of the mazydai first hand when she was young.
Mandri is like, seems like an alright guy.
Conversation about the ambush - mandri is like, he’s a tricksy dude. He can hear things hes shouldn’t be able to . He’s probably awake right now, listening to us. I wasn’t there, but, I just don’t see how. It’s like he can see through rocks. I mean, remember back in that pit cave and he was like, “they’re coming”, and then the scout whistled?
What do you hate about yourself?
Just sakes her head at the stupid question.
Gonna be thinking about that one for a while, huh?


Mandrameen could not recall a single day, from sunrise to sunset, where he hadn’t suffered from some shade of misery. He’d either be tired, or hungry, or afflicted with the ephemeral afflictions associated with stress, like the strange sensation of feeling out of breath when he could breathe perfectly fine - this tension in the middle of his chest, like he’d just run a hundred miles even though he’d been sitting on a feathered couch staring at the sun’s shadow as it crept up the wall. All that made it hard to have good, solid day, through and through.
Mandri once made the mistake of expressing this sentiment out loud, and he was told, quite brusquely, that he couldn’t remember happy days because he simply didn’t pay attention when he was in them. Essentially, the argument was that his life violated the aesthetic principle of contrast. To see Good, to appreciate it for what it is, it’s got to be put next to Bad. White is only bright when it’s set against dark. When one is living a life of relative luxury, as Mandri did, sheltered from the truly Bad, well of course he’s not going to be able to see the Good.
Mandri did not agree. Maybe the old crone was right, but he didn’t agree. He believed, instead, that what really made his life terrible was the pernicious idea that everything can always be better.
Now, that idea, in itself, did not make his life terrible. Most people who recognize the truth of such a conceit don’t let it get in the way of a good day. These people are, Mandri believed, the truly well-adjusted people. Instead of despising them, he envied them. He envied their parents. No doubt as children they had parents who played impressed at gifts they were given, mothers and fathers who would look at a mud sculpture wrought by tiny sausage fingers, and ignore the fact that it looked like the cast of an intestinal tract. They’d say, “What a lovely gift, thank you so much for making that for me.”
Mandri wouldn’t say it, because it sounded too conceited, but he honestly believed that he couldn’t be happy because his mother didn’t play dumb enough as he aged from four to six. Those are critical years. Where else but a mother is a child supposed to go for acceptance? Mandri would draw a picture and his mother would shrug, and so of course he’d hate it too. And what is a drawing but an ambitious fling of self expression? His drawings weren’t good enough, ans so he wasn’t good enough, at least not until he’d reached the age of eight. By that point, ‘Everything can always be better’ went from being a part of life’s milieu to an ingrained aspect of his psyche. This might have helped him become an accomplished painter, but it bled over into everything else.
He could find a flaw with anyone.
These flaws weren’t beauty marks, blemishes, flaws that when juxtaposed against perfection enhance it, they were structural flaws, dirty, frustrating, stupid flaws that made people unredeemable.
The best illustration of that point lied in the quest for physical beauty. Now, Mandri wasn’t shallow, for him, a flaw was a flaw of character, but physical beauty provides an apt metaphor for how Mandri felt about human beings. 
Sit and stare at someone for long enough, as a portrait artist must do, and the features of the face start to look funny. It doesn’t matter how attractive the person is, how much woodnut ash they’ve brushed into their eyebrows to fix them, how much bug blood they’ve used to rouge their lips to sell the appearance of health, how much they’ve brushed away the imperfections in their skin with the, when it came down to it, what the sitter was, was a gangly bag of supple flesh.
Ears. Ears are just ridiculous. What kind of shape is an ear? It’s like when Solraheen was creating people, he took a wad of clay, crumpled it up and then slapped onto the side of the head, expecting to come back to it later and just never did.
The teeth, the mouth, the gums, these are truly frightening things. Mandri had to paint a young beauty once and she insisted on smiling. The longer he looked, the more powerful was the feeling that she had become a ravenous beast, and at any moment she’d leap from her chair and start yapping for his flesh.
The breath. That’s not quite part of one’s physical appearance, but oh, the breath! If there was ever a sign of the pride and shit hiding inside of a person, it is stench of breath. Cover it up with a swig of mango juice, that doesn’t last long. Little wonder that in Jeket there’s a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. 
But ignore all that.
Get down to the basics.
Study the structure of the face.
There is not one person alive who’s face is perfectly symmetrical. There is always, always, some feature of the face which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and just kept going. Or maybe it didn’t grow fast enough to keep up.
Titled noses.
Slanted jaws.
Most common is uneven eyes, or uneven brows.
Sometimes the whole face seems to have slid around to one side, and so you see more of one cheek than the other. Or one side of the face was pinched, perhaps as it came out the womb, and now it’s stuck that way forever, leaving the mentioned in a state of permanent concern.
None of this is worth judging people for. Again, for Mandri this was only an illustration of the fact that if you look long enough at a person, inevitably you’ll find something that needs fixing, and while Mandri could fix a face on the canvas, there’s no fixing a person’s inner world.
‘Everything can always be better’.
That’s how it was.
Even out there in the desert, a place famous for its ability to shock a person into acceptance of the way things are, Mandri was still finding flaws in people. Well, ‘finding’ is too strong a word, because it didn’t take any effort. The absurdity, the strangeness, the ignorance, the stubbornness - the humanity of the Ayramun was on full display.
All of them would be easy to hate if Mandri really wanted to.
Well, all of them except one: Moteah. But that was only because Mandri hadn’t spent enough time with her. He was sure that if he got to know her, if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then that would be that.
Still, she had no obvious tells.
Like when Ayram announced the decision to leave and she was dumped in that clearing by everyone else to deal with the indignity of handling Mandri and the Mazyd, what did she do?
She didn’t complain. She got to work. And this wasn’t because she’d been cowed into it, she did it because it needed to be done. Like a mother cleaning up after children. She knew, by the way she comported, that the effort put in to getting someone like Moto to help would be greater than just doing it herself in the first place. To Mandri that was admirable. It was a sign that she knew what people were, but she soldiered on all the same. 
Admittedly, her beauty had a certain numbing effect on Mandri’s judgment.
Mandri found himself sitting there in the sand, hands idle, studying Moteah as she packed up a sack of unimportant things. She fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that’s taught to artists at a young age: don’t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if you have to make too many marks to bring out the features. The fewer marks you make, the better. If Mandri were to paint Moteah with as few marks as possible, he wouldn’t be lying all that much. Big, bright brown eyes flecked with gold, dark skin, full lips, and that was it. Her nose was hardly there. Her ears? Wrapped tight in a shawl.
“What are you going to carry?” Moteah asked. 
It took Mandri a second to realize that she was talking to him. Of course she was, there was no one else around.
“Uh, what do you want me to carry?” he asked.
“It’s either this,” Moteah lifted a pack to demonstrate it’s weight. “Or you carry the Mazyd on that.” She pointed to a wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps. It was the kind of thing that morning laborers used to carry sacks of grain.
Mandri said, “I’ll carry whatever you don’t want to.”
“Carry the Mazyd.”
Mandri said, “Alright,” and then he stood up, and walked over to where Obo was resting. Mandri gave Obo a nudge with his foot, but Obo didn’t stir. 
“He’s in pretty bad shape,” Mandri said. “You think he’s going to make it?”
“I don’t know if you are gonna to make it.” Moteah said as she looked Mandri up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness.
“Why wouldn’t I?”
“Do you know how far it is to the Ullr Basin?”
“I do not.”
“It’s a hundred miles.”
“That’s what, ten days?”
“You have no idea what you’re in for. Come on, pick him up.”
Mandri did as ordered. Obo was much lighter than he anticipated, even without his legs, and he fit nicely on the wood frame backpack. Mandri tightened a belt just under Obo’s arms, and then he picked the whole thing up threaded his own arms through the straps.
The frame was the perfect size for his back, and it had a lower strip to tighten it around his hips, and that kept Mazydobo’s weight resting kindly on top of them. Couldn’t be more than forty pounds.
“Thought he’d be heavier.”
“If you can carry more...”
“Oh, no. No. It’s more than heavy enough...Let’s he ad out, shall we?”
Moteah flicked her brows in, then saddled herself with her own giant pack of food and water and inclement things, and they followed the footprints of the other Ayramun as they led out of the rubble of Minting Rock. 
who were already marching off into the desert.
Mandri looked to see if they were following one of those old Charnel Roads that Moto had talked about, but if it was there he couldn’t see it. No gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and flat, and flat, and in the hazy distance, .
“You should be wearing Kell oil,” Moteah said. She pointed up at the sun.
“I don’t have any.”
“There’s some tied to my pack.”
Moteah stopped walking to let Mandri fish skin the of kell oil from her pack.
Coolness as the air hits the moisture on his skin.
“You know,” Mandri said, “you don’t strike me as a… how should I put this… You don’t strike me as someone who belongs out here.”
“And why is that?”
“For starters, you have all your teeth. And the way you talk, the way you act, the way you look... you just don’t seem like a person who would thrive out here.”
“Put it back if you’re done with it.”
“Oh,” Mandri said, and then he tied the skin of Kell oil back to Moteah’s pack. Once done, Moteah started walking.
“Also, you should eat something.”
“I don’t have anything to eat.”
“Here,” Moteah fished into her and pulled out a wafer of hard spekky bread; a .
Mandri took it from her chased after her. Could feel Mazydobo bobbing behind him.
Mandri said, “I mean what’s your story, you and Moto? Neither of you seem like you belong out here.”
“And you do?”
“Of course I do. Look at me.”
Moteah looks him up and down.
“Look at what?”
A little pang of hurt.
“I’m killed. I was killed. I was tossed out into the desert like trash. That’s what belongs out here, people who don’t have much use. I mean, I can barely walk.” 
His leg felt fine.
“Nobody belongs in the desert,” Moteah said. “Also, you have it backwards. You can’t be out in the desert unless you are useful.”
“Okay, the latter point is taken. But how can you say nobody belongs in the desert? What about the outland tribes?”
“They stick to oases and the wells they carve out of the ground, not the desert.”
“That’s basically the desert.”
“No, it is not. No one wants to be out here, Mandri.”
“What about the Jeketian Fathers?”
“What about them?”
“They wanted to live in the desert. And people still live like them, they go and seek out caves, and, I don’t know, try to cleanse the Spark or something.”
“That not what the Jeketian Fathers did.”
“See, the fact that you even know that proves that you’ve had some education. And educated people don’t belong out in the desert. They belong in cities, where there’s things to learn and teach. This desert is a place for people like me, people like the Fathers, people like outland tribes.”
“Again, no outland tribe wants to live in the desert. They’d rather live next to the coast or a river, or in the highlands with the rain. It was the same for the Jeketian Fathers.”
“Then why did they live in the desert?”
“Because they were pushed there. Their sermons didn’t line up with the Hrkan world, so this wilderness was the only place they were allowed to live.”
“Okay, then that still fits with my general point; if they’re outcasts, then they belong to the desert. You, however, I refuse to believe that you’re an outcast. I bet you could wed a Hrkan prince.”
The look she gave him. Oooh.
“I’m not saying you should! I’m just saying, you know… Look, I know the standards for the kind of people they accept, and you’d fit right in. But the desert, it’s a place for people who don’t have a place. It’s the undesirables, it’s the bandits, the barbarians, and then the saintly folk, like the Fathers. People not fit for the horde.”
“You don’t know anything about the desert.”
“What’s there to know? It’s hot. There’s sand. And clay. No water.”
Moteah reaches down and tosses him a bulbous root.
“What’s this?”
“Squeeze it.”
Squeezes it and water comes out.
“Okay, fair enough. But this doesn’t change the fact that you don’t belong out here.”
“No one belongs out here.”
“Where are you from?”
“Ganniba.”
“Where’s that?”
“Nowhere.”
“Is that supposed to be some kind of Zosan pun?”
“Ganniba doesn’t exist anymore.”
Solemn moment. Assumptions starting to break down.
“What happened?”
“Hrk.”
“They burned your village to the ground?”
“They didn’t need to. First, they diverted our river. Then our fields dried up, and that was the end Ganniba.”
Mandri is like, well shit.
“Well, I’m sorry to hear that.”
Moteah grunts.
“What about your people, though? Couldn’t you move elsewhere, to some other river?”
Laughs like he’d said the most ridiculous thing.
“It’s telling that you didn’t ask, ‘Why didn’t you fight back?’.”
“Well, how could you? This is the Hrks we’re talking about.”
“Don’t know anything about the desert, don’t know anything about the Hrks.”
“While I haven’t lived in the desert, I have lived in Jeket. I know all about the Hrks.”
“Yet you don’t seem to understand that if the Hrks want you dead, then you have no other option but to fight back.”
“You could run away.”
“We did. We fled to a river bend in the Subli. The Subli isn’t fit for habitation. The bed is dried up more often than not. Nobody lived there. It wasn’t sustainable. The Hrks showed up anyway and said we weren’t allowed to be there. They said the only place we were permitted to live was within the confines of the Harka delta. Since you’re so well versed in Hrkan affairs, I’m sure you know that means slavery. We said no. Then the Hrks surrounded us and ordered us to fight. ‘Submit, or fight!’, those were our options. We said we didn’t have weapons, and they gave us weapons. They actually waited four days for a courier to run to the nearest outpost and fetch a wagon of weapons. When it came to it, our men had barely eaten in a week. We weren’t outnumbered if our mothers fought, so they did. Only four of us survived. Moto and I survived, but that was the end of my father’s tribe.”
Sad story. She was a princess, makes sense. Chosen for it.
“Well… That’s, uh… You seem remarkably well composed, considering.”
“I’ve learned to deal with it.”
“I still think you could make it in a Hrkan city. I know you hate Hrks, but that hasn’t stopped tribes from settling down in places like Meskahinne, or even Jeket.”
“Hrk is evil. There is no.”
“Oh, I don’t know about that.”
“You don’t know?”
“You’re not going to like what I have to say here, so I feel like I shouldn’t say it.”
“What is there that you could possibly say? I just told you that the Hrks slaughtered my people, and you don’t think they’re evil?”

“It’s not that I think they’re good, it’s just that I don’t think that Hrk is worse than anyone else.”
Pshaw.
“Everyone looks out for themselves, more or less. Everyone is taking advantage of someone else, whether they know it or not. The only difference is that the Hrks have a lot more power, so it’s all scaled up. So where like, some outland tribe might only be taking the spit out of a few people, Hrks are doing it to thousands.”
“Hundreds of thousands.”
“The numbers don’t matter. If the roles were swapped, if the people of the outland tribes had Hrk’s kind of power, they’d be doing the same godsdamned things.”
Dismissive laugh.
“You’ve spent too much time in Jeket with all the snakes and spiders.”
“Believe what you what. I’ve met enough people to know that we’re all more or less the same. If you had the reins of a nation as big as Hrk, you’d be bullying everyone else into doing what you want.”
“That is the exact opposite of what I would do.”
“You say that, but I’ve seen it play out already. There’s this one outland tribe, the Sulay, they got absorbed into Meskahinne.”
“You mean they were conquered.”
“Absorbed, conquered, its the all the same.”
“Absorbed implies that half of them weren’t murdered first.”
“Sure. Whatever. They were conquered, and then they started farming in the hole at Meskahinne. Soon, they settled in, became full, upright citizens of Hrk, and guess what they did when they got into politics? I kid you not, I watched a Sulay man argue, well, not argue, it was more like he was spitting rage, claiming as he did that there was an untouched remnant of the Sulay tribe that needed taming. And this man knew what ‘taming’ meant. He knew what he was asking for.”
“Just because one old man is a charred spark, that doesn’t mean everyone is.”
“All I’m saying is that on balance, on the whole, people look for the shortest path and more often than not, the shortest path involves running right through somebody else.”
Almost at a lost for words. Mandri thinks he’s got her on the ropes. goes in.
“It’s a good thing that you’re out here, Mandri.”
“Why is that?”
“You’re going to learn the value of depending upon other people. You’ll die otherwise. What’s more, is that people are going to depend upon you.”
“Well, that would be a mistake.”
“Mistake or not, it will happen, and either you’ll get someone killed, or you’ll learn the virtue of sacrifice.”
“I’d be hard pressed to imagine a scenario where I’d sacrifice myself for any of you.”
“Why not?”
“Are you serious? I hardly know you people. And I can’t say I believe in your cause.”
“Is there anyone you’d sacrifice yourself for, or is everyone unworthy of Mandrameen?”
“I’ve never met someone who needs to be alive, if that makes sense.”
“Solraheen knew what the Hrks would do to his fallen body, and yet he still sacrificed himself to prevent Schisol from destroying the world.”
“I’m not Solraheen.”
“True enough. You are a transient creature. You are here for a flash and then gone. But I wonder, if that’s the case, why not live your life to It doesn’t matter what path we take, we’re all headed for the same place.”
“I’m sorry, but, I don’t really go in for that kind of thinking. I’m not a religious man. I’m sure Solraheen had his reasons, but people aren’t worth saving. They’re hardly worth talking to. I don’t mean you, of course. I mean, all things considered this is a stimulating conversation.”
Moteah stopped walking. She pointed off to her left, at an unremarkable patch of scrub.
She asked Mandri, “Do you see those Hooky flies?”
Above the scrub there was little swarm of pinprick dots.
“There’s a couple hundred flies there. And remember, a fly can go anywhere; they can walk along the ground, they can fly to in every direction, they could explore to the ends of the earth and see sights unseen. But they don’t. The hover in that small, boring ball of air. You know why?”
“Why?” Mandri asked. He braced himself for a bit of folksy desert wisdom.
“Hooky flies swarm like that because the most interesting thing in all the world is each other.”
Moteah gave Mandri a quick smile of questionable sincerity, and then she walked off to join the trail of Ayramun.
 Mandri was stuck looking at those flies. Well, not the flies, he was stuck on Moteah’s metaphor. Like most metaphors, it had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down the more he thought it through. Like those flies weren’t flying around in a ball because of the fulfillment they got in developing personal relationships with their little fellows. There were, no doubt, more primal interests at play. Maybe they’d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the wind, making it easier to fly. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a ball like that because it’s the easiest way to bump into something to mate with.
That would be apt metaphor for people, Mandri supposed. It’d be easy to get away with saying that the only thing that holds a city together is lust.
Mandri looked after Moteah, and she’d already gotten a ways away.
“Moteah!” Mandri shouted.
“What?” was the annoyed reply. Not too annoyed, though, because Moteah stopped and turned to see what Mandri wanted.
Mandri jogged to catch up. Obo bobbed in the. The straps dug into his shoulders. When he finally joined up with Moteah, they continued on as a pair.
Mandri asked, “Why are you trying to kill Solraheen? I mean, everyone always says that He’s the One True Good in this wretched world, and you seem to agree. Why kill him? Just to spite the Hrks?”
“I don’t think you quite understand what the Hrk’s are doing to Solraheen. His body and His message have been so utterly polluted by the Solitant priests in Jeket, that His name has nearly lost all meaning. What He would want - what He would command if His mind were not unwound by poisonous fumes - is to have his own Spark cleansed of the impurity. The only way to do that is to destroy his body completely, and once that is done, Jeket will tumble down into the earth, and the rest of the Hrkan world will go with it, as punishment for their sins.”
This pronouncement was certain
“What makes you so sure it’s going to play out like that?”
“I’m not sure.”
“But like Obo said, killing Solraheen isn’t going to-”
“Please. A Mazyd has no real thoughts worth listening to.”
“Oh, I don’t know about that. Obo seems pretty clever.”
“Stop calling him ‘Obo’.” Moteah said the name with such contempt that Mandri wasn’t sure if the sting was meant for Obo or the people who made him. 
“I think it’s necessary to dehumanize him like that. It is his name.”
Moteah said, “Mandri, it’s not a human.”
“We give names to dogs.”
“Dogs have feelings, empathy. All the Mazydai have is the capacity to know things, but they can’t understand. They’re not human. They’ll never understand why we do what we do, or why we feel so strongly about things unremembered.”
“I don’t know… Obo seems clever to me.”
“If it were clever, we wouldn’t have been able to ambush it like a deer.”
“I suppose you’re right.”
Stepping.
“How did you manage to ambush Obo?”
“With ease.”
“That’s what I don’t get. Obo can practically see through rocks. He can smell things from miles away. I don’t see how it’s possible that he could be ambushed. Remember when were in that pit cave, and he said there were Hrks coming? He knew before your scout did.”
“Mazyd’s can’t see through rocks.”
“How do you know?”
“Because if he could.”
“I don’t know. I just know he’s a deceitful character. Like, I bet he’s not even asleep right now. He plays at being unconscious when you Ayramun handle him.” 
Mandri shook his pack to see if he could get Obo to stir, but Obo’s head just bobbled side to side, before coming to rest in a dead man’s hang.
“?”


“Interesting woman.” He was not at all surprised to discover that Obo had been awake the whole time.
“She is. And damn, she’s beautiful. You know, normally, I’d be falling hard for a woman like that. But I don’t really feel any way about her.”
“That’s because she’s been putting succor of salt in your bread.”
“What’s that got to do with it?”
“Succor of salt is an anaphrodisiac. It curbs the libido.”
“What?”
“It makes you impotent.”
“Eaugh!” Mandri spits it out.
“That’s the only food you’ve got. You’re going to need it.”


“Let it be said that I that I think this is a bad idea. Gloating may be beneath the Ayramun, but not me. I will say I told you so at my earliest convenience.”
“You only feel that way because you’re going to be the bait.”
“I don’t care about you at all, Obo. This is just a bad idea.”
“There’s no such thing as a bad idea.”
“There most certainly is!” Mandri said.
“There are no bad ideas, only people who aren’t skilled enough to turn bad situations into good ones.”
“What, you think you’re good at making the best of things? Do you have eyes? I mean, I know you can turn off your pain, but have you turned off your vision? Look at the state of yourself.”
“Mandri, you are literally carrying me around on a litter like I’m a tribal king of old.”
“You are utterly and completely at Ayram’s mercy.”
“I’d say, everything considered, things are about as good as they could possibly be.”
“Whatever. Everything can always be better.”

“Then should I whistle the boys?” Pella asked, looking a little grim. It was a look which came quite easy for her.
“Yes,” Ayram replied. “Be sure to stab and flutter it. Like you say, we need caution.”
 Pella nodded, then put her hands to her mouth and whistled the song of the Jade Tresset to let the men know that the ambush was on. She stabbed and fluttered the high notes, as Ayram had directed.
Ayram waited a bit for twittered replies to spring from his people’s hiding spots, and then he squeezed his giant frame into the little cave behind them, leaving Pella to deal with Seculla and Mandrameen as they bickered over who got to look through the scope.
Cloistered within the cramped cave was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, five years younger than Pella, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Ayram, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The beast was belly up, and her fingers were knuckle deep in it’s guts, twisting and twirling as her lips whispered incantations and her eyes searched the pink sliver of morning sky that peeked through the crack in the rocks above.
“It’s almost time,” Ayram warned.
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, though she did not take her eyes off the sky, nor her hand from the lizard’s corpse.
“What thing is more vital than blood?” she asked the world. “Blood cold as ice…” 
She pushed down with the palm of her hand to squeeze acids out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Blood hot as a raging fire….” 
She squeezed the intestinal organs with her knotted fingers. 
“We would be gods if not for blood…”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up.
“We would be dust without it.” 
Elrahet threw the entrails down, back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
When nothing happened, she snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.
The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Ayram supposed that the thing was somehow still alive. When Elrahet finally pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh, it went completely limp.
“It is possible,” Elrahet said to Ayram in a quiet whisper so that none outside could hear, “that the beast is infertile.” 
“So this won’t work?” Ayram knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Ayram spread apart the lizard’s corpse. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines writhed and pulsed like a knotted mass of worms. 
He was impressed.
“Well... it was worth a try,” he said.
Elrahet hissed at his dubiety. “I just need fertile blood. Fresh fertile blood,” she stressed.
Ayram thought for a moment, then pulled up his sleeve and extended his hairy brown arm towards Elrahet.
“Your blood? I won’t carve you open,” Elrahet croaked. “Get me one of the Pazard boys or something.”
“There’s no time. It’s either me or Pella... Or no one.” 
“That old Imperial sow isn’t fertile.”
“Well then,” Ayram said, extending his arm further.
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given by one Jandrian to another. Elrahet had been Ayram’s witch for years and he had never offered a drop. She tried to gauge his countenance to see if he was sincere - but his face was set deep in the shadow of his hood and his eyes were sunk back behind bushy brows. His beard hid whatever slight expression his lips might reveal. Even clean shaven and in direct light, the difference between his smile and a frown was imperceptible. 
She looked down at his arm and eyed the veins that bulged under the skin. She knew his blood would be potent. 
“We can do this without you,” Ayram said with more than a hint of impatience.
At that, Elrahet pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from her bag and laid them between herself and Ayram. Then she unsheathed a patterned blade from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise to Ayram’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said.
“And I yours,” Ayram replied. 
Elrahet savored his courtesy with a near-toothless grin, then eagerly plunged her dagger’s tip into his flesh. She flicked her wrist with expert care and opened the vein. Ayram remained unstirred, watching with serious intent as blood bubbled out of the wound and ran around his wrist in a steady stream to drip into the bowl.
 When he had enough, he jerked his arm free.
“That’s it.” He said. 
The bowl was just half full.
“Your gift is humbling, but if that is it… don’t expect much,” Elrahet grumbled.
“I did say that we can do this without you.”
Elrahet scowled, then took the bowl and began to flick Ayram’s blood onto the lizard’s corpse, careful to make sure that not a drop hit the dirt.
Ayram took the yard of linen to dress his wound. As he tried to maneuver his hips round so he could leave, he bumped Elrahet. 
“Get out of here!” she snapped. 
Ayram laughed as he did.

Maybe do short desc. Of the ravine here.

The first signs of Elrahet’s magic were the wispy vapor trails that circulated high in the atmosphere above her cave. They twirled and danced, driven by unnatural purpose, though they were so slight that they could hardly be said to be there at all. By the time Ayram sat down at his hiding spot behind a couple of small boulders on the northern slope of the ravine, the trails had begun to congeal into something thicker.
Soon the wind picked up and began to brush them into form, and it blew a pleasant musk of earthy, humid air down into the ravine. If Ayram had not been looking for it, he might not have noticed how a light fog subtly shifting into existence. Just as he began to wonder if the crew had taken notice, a low rolling drum of distant thunder echoed through the valley, though there was, as yet, no great storm from which it could have come.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papillian excitedly. The boy was stationed behind a boulder closer to the road. Ayram glared down at him with sufficient sternness to shush him. He didn’t blame the lad for the outburst as this was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of magic.
It was perhaps too good. The merchant caravan was still far out. Perhaps they had not yet made it into the valley’s fingers. Perhaps they could see the cyclonic flow of haze that now swirled above Elrahet’s cave. Still, Ayram half expected that it all might fizzle out - humans made for poor magicians - but all his doubts were allayed when dense clouds began to creep out from some invisible fissure in the sky.
They crept out slowly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. Once they were out over the ravine they began to feed, to chew and swallow the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the lizard that Elrahet had prepared. 
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, just little pricklings on the skin, just a light peppering of the sandy rocks and clay. The drizzle cleansed the air of the desert dust that was ever present in the Sand, the stuff that clogged the nose and scratched the throat. In fact the air was so crisp that this was the first time in forever that Ayram could take in a full, clean breath. It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.
More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Ayram found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all. 
At least the earth seemed to enjoy it, parched and desiccated as it was. It took its time to drink its fill. It filtered the water through sand and silt and then trickled it down into the deep reservoirs of the world. It savoured every drop, and it drank slowly, which meant that it did not take long for the surface to become soaked. Soon rain began to pitter-patter into puddles, and water ran down the ravine, seeking out the familiar routes that it had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millenia. Where once there were cracks, pits, and sinks in the rock and clay, there were now streams and cascades. Where once there were depressions and scars, there were now pools in which desert life would find succor.
Ayram looked over to the young Papillian. Though the rain was rare and precious on this side of the Junei Mountains, the boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers. He might as well have been swimming. 
He muttered a curse, and the storm cursed back.


CRACK-BOOM!


A bright and gnarled flash of lightning split the dark sky above. 
It hit somewhere near in the cliffs behind them.
Everyone jumped.
“Elra’s never conjured more than foggy mist!” Papillian exclaimed.
Colm, a beastly man to Papillian’s side could be heard as well. “Bit much innit?”
Ayram disagreed. By this point the valley road was getting good and slick and muddy. Laden wagons would have to be dragged through it. They would be moving slowly, if they would move at all - though that was cause for some concern. They might not even make it into the ravine. Or, they might have turned around and fled the valley as soon as the first showers hit them.
 Then a faint horse’s whinny pierced the splashing of the rain. 
Ayram turned his gaze southward. There he could just make out the shapes of white horses coming round the bend. Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Ayram could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.
Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Ayram expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.
Ayram would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn’t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers’ turbans. They were each, to a man, Roman[a]. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.
Ayram's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Ayram felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.
By the time the middle of column had reached Ayram’s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.
 The dead rider’s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 
So began the battle.
Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Ayram had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. 
Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.
 An officer’s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Ayram. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. 
They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.
Ayram eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party’s arrows from whittling them down one by one.
Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his hands began to glow.
Ayram notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. 
Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. 


CRACK-BOOM!

Need to magnify the dstruction. THe horror of his comrades dying.

Play up the arrow. Blessing of the arrow. Doctor puts ointment on it. 


A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Ayram back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. 
Then things went black.
 

She put a knife to Mandri’s throat.
“This is your father’s fault,” she said, then gave him a scar to remind him of it.

Ayram — don’t hold it against her. She’s been through a lot.

Empire web - like early assyria, takes over important resources and skips over compliant states, so long as they pay tribute. Mudwater, an eastern port, is one of these important strategic spots, but long negleted.

Pyetle is a failed farmer. Old and past it. Depressed. Immanently about to kill himself. Sees man (general) who has it worse than him, and decides to do something about it.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Need that moment of decision - I’m going to do something about this shit.




Pyetle

Pyetle is stuck in the debt traps of the ancient world - oppressive imperial system.

Iyram has been selling Splytu’s diluted blood to the emperor, in exchange for keeping out of Jandria. He doesn’t want them in because of fear of them sprawling out through the underworld and finding Splytu.
Thats why Mazydei was ostensibly out there - on orders of emperor to secure the source of the liquid.


What kind of a fool could be around humanity for a hundred thousand years and not expect that a king would come looking for it?

The split God.
Sohen/Monu - Sun/Moon
Sohen and Monu co-exist in the same form. Only one is ‘active’ at a time. They are immortal, but can die. Upon death, the active deity switches from light - dark and vice-versa. 
Special powers - beam of light - weather - mind control - bending

Why would Sohen want record keeper?
	- keep track of progress
Why would Monu acquiese to record keeper?
	- keep track of sohen.

Splytu to Iyram:
 “Why didn’t you aid me earlier?”
“I’ve only now just found you.”

Sohn comes out speaking assyrian,
Iyram stumbles through words.
Splytu reaches out and grabs his hands, thumb in palm, and inhales. Some essence seems to leave Iram, and Splytu inhales it. Splytu gains the knowledge of all that has occurred during his incession.

Iyram lays prostrate before Splytu.

Your mind is blurred, Ayram. 

You’ve forgotten the tongue. Why is that?
It has been long since I need have use for it, and I am only a man.
Your mind is blurred. Last time I looked through your mind it was as clear as the pools of Isil. What have you been putting into your body besides my blood?
Silence.
Ayram, you’ve been supping my blood for a hundred thousand years, yet the last few was enough to make you crumble?
Ayrams face contorts in sorrow and pain.
Sigh - This is what you get for serving a usurper.
I can only be loyal to Him who is present.
I know. I know. But I am always present, dear Ayram. Never forget the truth, and what is at stake. 
He presses his thumb into ayrams forehead, and Ayram begins to weep.


Looks into the dark
“Who are you?”

Lord, I wish to be released from your service.
Do you?



 



Another moment of tension. Ayram did not dare speak. Dared not exercise will.

How long was did you keep me under rock?
Three-thousand years.
Only three? No irrepreable damage could have been done, I’m sure. I forgive you, Ayram. But where is the frail old goat? I require a more complete picture of the story than the one you’ve given.
I killed him.
Did you? Why?


Splytu can absorb knowledge by touch.


Sohn, looking to Mandri, Pyetle, 
Iyram: This is the new story keeper.
Sohn: You are my story keeper.
Iyram: I wish to be released from your service.
Sohn: Come Mandri, eat of my flesh and enter my service.
Thank you my lord
No Iyram, no I’ve still use for you.
Sohn: Splytu? in Et? How long have I been under? 
Three thousand years, my lord.
Only three? Good.
	Stretches- regain familiarity with the body
How long was our body trapped under that rock?
Two thousand three hundred and eighty for days.









Iyram
Immortal man. Was granted immortality eons ago by eating the flesh of the god. He is the record-keeper - way for the two gods to talk to keep track of what happens - but really, gods treat him as a kind of pet.
Commentary on christians - keep their god hostage to their will, eat his flesh to make themselves more powerful - using ‘god’s will to get their way in this life’.

Seculla

Girl gets turned into perl. Pyetle snatches it up after ayram explodes on himself. Pyetle goes into door to turn girl back. “Ill do it if you kill me”.

Seculla and Iram, only one at a time.

            <Text>Galen believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.[8] 

Caspar Friedrich Wolff (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of epigenesis in embryology, that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his Theoria Generationis (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a vis essentialis (an organizing, formative force) 

The difference between intrinisic wants that you have no control over, and learned wants.
But is there really an edge between the two?

We see in the human the development of a body of learned information which we call culture. Culture is what is learned and transmitted to subsequent generations through teaching. In addition to a genetical inheritance humans acquired a rich cultural inheritance.

Behaviour has evolved from highly programmed stereotyped responses to a much more flexible adaptation to the environment by means of learning from experience. An animal with a small brain and a small cortex is more like a programmed automaton keyed to certain principla features of its environment, the sign stimuli, which it must respond to if it is to thrive. 

Larger brain can learn to select among the stimuli in its environment. It moulds itself to the local environment and responds with greater precision and saftey. 

As an animal he would remain almost stationary the changes of the surounding universe would cease to have upon himthat powerful modifying effect whichit exercises over other parts of the organic world. But from the moment that his body became stationary, his mind would become subject to those very influences from which his body had escaped. Every slight variation in his mental and moral nature which should enable him to better guard against adverse circumstances, and combine for mutual comfort and protection, would be preserved and accumulated; the better and higher specimens of our race would therefore increase and spread, the lower and more brutal would give way and successively die out, and that rapid advancement of mental organization would occur, which has raise dhte very lowest races of man so far above the brutes. - quote by hardy 1966, p. 36

Popper - culter is ‘world three’, world one being the physical world, world two, the world of consciousness. Imagine that tools and machines are destroyed and with them all subjective learning, including the knowledge of how to use tools and knowledge. All libraries are destroyed so that the human capacity to learn from these books becomes useless. There would be no re-emergence of human culture for millenia. Humanity would be transported far back into pre-history and would have to begin again the long upward climb. Had libraries survived in this scenario the world would have got going again.


Although cultureal 

The first man is a crowd - de chardin

IN my hunt for the secret of life, I started my research in histology. Unsatisfied by the information that cellular morphology could give me about life, I turned to physiology. Finding physiology to ocomplex, I took up phramacology. Still finding the situation too complicated, I turned to bacteriology. But bacteria were even too complex, so, I descended to the molecular level, studying chemistry and physical chemistry. After twenty years work, I was led to conclude that to understand life we have to descend to the electronic level, and to the world of wave mechanics. But electrons are just electrons and have no life at all. Evidently on the way I lost life; it had run out between my fingers.

A house is more than a collection of bricks.
Particular arbritrariness of drawing any definite line between what is alive and what is not.

Any scientific experiment presupposes the division of the world into what is regarded as relevant and what is regarded as irrelevant. Jack is put In a box. But there is a lot outside the box and there are connections between twhat is outside and what is inside. The answers obstained are necessarily limited to what is put inside the box. 

Mechanistic model - the living organism is a machine. All scientists are methodolical mechanists if not metaphysical mechanists.


Woodger (1929, p.237) Pw Bridgman logic of modern physics:
… I believe many will discover in themselves a longing for mechanical explanation which has all the tenacity of original sin. The discovery of such a desire need not occasion any particular alarm, because it is easy to see how the demand for this sort of explanation has had its origin in the enormous preponderence of the mechanical in our experience.

Democritus in 400bc - there are nothing but atoms and space, all else is an impression of the senses.’

The process of evolution is conceived by biological determinists, such as jacques monod, as an entirely determined set of operations that reduces itself to the organisation of atoms and molecules into complex forms.

People can choose the future. That is the meaning of cultural evolution.

Would be able to predict the behavior of any person unless I had perfect knowledge of every molecule in the universe.

Galen - was a physician. Surgeon to the gladiators in pergamum, where he got considerable practice in studying human internal anatomy. When in not a thousand or ten thousand people we observe malformation of the sixth finger can you consider this accomplishment by nature accidental? Like erasistratus before him, galen conceived dthat a vital principle was absorbed through the lungs from the air. He thus regarded the blood, which reached the left side of the heart from the lungs and which then surged through the arteries as rich red arterial blood, to be charged with a vital principle or vital spirit. Second sort of vital spirit, associated with the nervous system.

Living organisms must be endowed with something no inanimate object possessed. He termed this entelechy. 

Bergson - elan vital - direction and purpose to life.  Eln vital no more explains the history of life than would ascribing an elan locomotif to a steam engine to explain its motion. 

Elsasser - A biotonic law, a phrase invented by Elsasser, is a principle of nature which is not contained in the principles of physics.[11]
Biotonic laws may also be considered as local instances of global organismic or organismal principles,[12][13] such as the Organismic Principle of Natural Selection.
 Basic to Elsasser's biological thought is the notion of the great complexity of the cell. Elsasser deduced from this that any investigation of a causative chain of events in a biological system will reach a &quot;terminal point&quot;, where the number of possible inputs into the chain will overwhelm the capacity of the scientist to make predictions, even with the most powerful computers. This might seem like a counsel of despair, but in fact Elsasser was not suggesting the abandonment of biology as a worthwhile research topic, but rather for a different kind of biology such that molecular causal chains are no longer the main focus of study. Correlation between supra-molecular events would become the main data source. Moreover, the heterogeneity of logical classes encompassed by all biological organisms without exception is an important part of Elsasser's legacy to both Complex systems biology and Relational Biology.[16] 

How can qualities such as livingness and mentality be derived from something which totally lacks these qualities. 

Ecological model - things are directly connected to and cannot be separated from environment. One and the same cell will function very differently when placed in a different environment.

It is the presence of this elaborate individual, with a history, acting as a chooser with an ‘aim’, that makes the whole process so unlike all known chemical reactions except those of other living things.
Young thus makes the critically important point that the cell is not just a bag of enzymes that are turned on and off by mechanical forces. When the bacterium recognises a particular sugar the cell then selects one of a series of chemical pathways already established in the non-nuclear part (cytoplasm) of the cell. The cell does not set up this pathway de novo. It has already been established in the cytoplasm by virtue of the cell’s evolutionary history.

Ecological model which views each living thing, and each component of a living thing, as part of a system. There is no way to go below the level of the systematic interconnections of events to another level at which there are self-contained entities whose properties in isolation from one another explain the system.

No event first occurs and then relates to its world. The event is a synthesis of relations to other events.

Graveyards are full of people that were righteous

Twenty years ago, Pyetle met his first wife Seculla at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Shagotan functionary was entertaining some Hrkkan dignitary, and so the wine was flowing and the air was thick with ambition. Not a place for depressed people. They don’t have the stamina for it. Both Pyetle and Seculla were depressed people. They filtered through the pretension and collided in one corner of the cordoned off where they clustered together for sanity. This sparked a relationship. After this, they began to write letters back and forth.
Pyetle found it difficult to explain that he was depressed because he came from old money. It’s not a sympathetic cause and so even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn’t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract. He wrote to Seculla about how he hated the word ‘depression’.
 He remarked that a ‘depression’ is just a bit of land that’s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you’re walking along you’ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It’s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea. It’s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words a depression isn’t depressing. 
Mandrameen thought the use of the word was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him. Made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone’s been sad, so everyone’s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they’ve got the place mapped, but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn’t on any goddamn map. You get lost there. You don’t come back.
Seculla wrote back that he was, again, being a fool. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place in the world was a depression: the Empty Portion. It’s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the Shamal blows in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings monsoons in from the south-west. 
The Empty Portion is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is the desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of it, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting object for Mandrameen’s analogy, that was it, and it was a depression, and it most certainly was on a map.
Mandrameen was too sentimental about the Sands to agree with her. The Empty Portion was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure. He’d wax on about virginal passages and rich young men who fought to be the first to expose and penetrate its secrets. Besides, the Gods lived there, the Desert Fathers lived there, and so he couldn’t possibly think of it as depressing.
Eventually, and this took months, subtle lust worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the Earth best suited to the task was the Underworld. The sun can’t reach there, so you can only see as far as the light that you carry. There is no color or life. There’s just the maze of rock, the abyss, and your own private thoughts. There’s nothing to do but wander and wait for death.
What they didn’t consider - what they didn’t know - was Fear. Not the blunt, cerebral fear that might keep the depressed in bed, but the sharp, waking fear that keeps a man running through the Underworld. Neither Mandrameen nor Seculla had ever truly gazed into the abyss. The real things, the avens of the Earth, they’re chittering-chattering throats that threaten to vomit out teeth and claws and demons should you turn your back. They spike the body with tension, they push out all thoughts and worries save one: Back. Out. Slowly. 
If Mandrameen and Seculla had ever been forced to crawl through the damp dark of the Underworld, as Pyetle was forced by Ayram and Hill, their error would have slapped them in the face. The only thing keeping Pyetle from losing his wits entirely was the drink. He couldn’t fixate on the terror even if he tried.
He would cast wary glances into dark tunnels as he passed them. He struggled to figure if the glowing eyes and shifting shadows he thought he saw were real or just glistening bits of rock. Ayram and Hill were moving too quickly to let his blurry eyes bring any particular fright into focus. ‘Keep moving’ was the order. Not just because of whatever might lurk in the dark, but because an icy breeze, the billows of the Earth, it was cold enough to condense the vapor of his breath into ice. 
With only a thin cotton tunic, Pyetle was especially chilled. The drink helped with that, too.
“Where are we going?” He whispered as he tramped along behind Hill. 
Hill didn’t stop to answer. He just grunted. 
“I just want to know where the hell -”
Hill paused and whipped round. “Were you never told stories of Swadin?”
Pyetle nodded. 
“Then be quiet!”
At this point Ayram had stopped as well. “We’ve got some miles to cover,” he said.
“Miles?” Pyetle mumbled. “You can find your way for miles?”
But Ayram was already turning back round to the path. Hill grunted again and followed along. Pyetle came flying behind.
The way meandered up and down, but it kept to a relative mean. Pyetle expected to be confronted at every turn by a vertical shaft or impassible slump of boulders - and there were plenty of these - but Ayram knew the ways around them. As they shifted around the ledge of one particularly jagged rent in the earth, a rock broke out from under Pyetle’s foot, and it fell into the darkness. The silence was horrifying. After a long age of seconds a stupefying, far-off boom rumbled below. Behind it came a cloud of steam and a wheezing, sulfurous hiss. Pyetle thought he saw a flash of green light deep down in the abyss. 
“Twelve seconds,” Ayram remarked.
“That makes it what?” Hill asked.
“Almost two hundred lengths.”
“Not deep enough.”
“Deep enough for what?” Pyetle asked.
“Let’s just say,” Hill said as he looked knowingly at Ayram, “that we’re safe for now.”
 Ayram led them on through a winding fissure and through a series of low-hung corridors. At times they had to crawl or squeeze through cracks, and again, it was worst for Pyetle. His cotton tunic did nothing to brunt the shocking chill of the rock and mud against his skin. It didn’t help that the torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable; hidden edges and shadowed protrusions stabbed and bruised his flesh as he scraped along. In an hour his tunic was reduced to wet rags. 
Each time he stumbled out of a crack he found that Ayram and Hill were further and further ahead. When it got to the point that he couldn’t see their dark figures cut out against torchlight, he yelled for them to wait. 
“Hill! Ayram!”
He hurried along, chasing the orange glow of Hill’s torch. If it grew any fainter it would take the rock around him with it. He could feel the darkness pushing in, closing down on him.
“Ayram!”
He rushed round a corner and nearly spilled onto marbled rock. Here the floor was carved and polished and cut with an intricate diamond pattern. It was as wide as a carriageway. The light of Hill’s torch climbed up straight and even walls then fell softly into shadow, unable to reach the distant ceiling - if indeed there was one. At the distant end of this great hall, Hill and Ayram stood at the threshold of an enormous double-door. 
They were whispering to each other. Hill seemed upset. Ayram shook him away, then pushed on the massive door. An awful grinding noise echoed down the hall towards Pyetle, and once there was enough room for Ayram to slip inside, he went in. Slowly, the door closed behind him. 
Hill turned round then jumped in fright when he saw Pyetle standing there in the middle distance, dimly lit, half-naked and muddy, with eyes as wide as saucers.
“Shyza!” Hill screamed. “Pyetle! I thought you a witherman!”
“Not one yet,” Pyetle grumbled as he marched towards the warmth of Hill’s torch. “But I might be made one soon in this damned place… Would it kill you to slow down?”
Hill smiled. “It could. Here, take this.” He handed Pyetle the torch, then undid the clasp of his black cloak and unwrapped it, then put it on Pyetle’s shoulders. Pyetle tugged it tight.
“That’s not how you wear it. Wrap it here, across chest, under arm. Yes. There you go. Is good?”
Pyetle nodded, then turned toward the doors. They were three times his height, arched in the middle, and engraved all up and down in rows were lines of soldiers.
“What is this place?” Pyetle asked. 
“Oh, don’t think of it.”
“Do you live here?”
“No, no, no, no. This is bad, bad place.”
“Can I go in?”
“NO. No, no, no, no.”
“Hill. Give me something here. I want to know what the hell is going on.”
“Oh… no for me to say. Let’s say that - Ayram do business here. But don’t think of it.”
“Don’t think of it? This is incredible! I’ve never even heard of something like this in the Underworld. The fact that people braved this foul place long enough to carve a-” Pyetle’s next words got stuck in his throat as his eyes fell upon the carved demon’s head set atop the door frame. Granite shoulders popped out of the rock next to it, and long, spindly arms spread all the way around the door-frame to the floor, where hands clutched the bottom of the doors, as if holding them up. 
“People built this, right?”
“Don’t think of it.”
“Ugh. Hill, man, what the hell do you expect me to think about? We’re in the Underworld, and that’s a fucking demon door, and Ayram just walked inside.”
“I think you still drunk, my friend.”
It surprised Pyetle to realize that he was still drunk. He looked back at the door. Nope. Still a demon door.
“Come, Pyetle, let me show you a thing.”
Hill took Pyetle by the shoulder and led him back down the hall and into the more familiar, the more natural part of the Underworld. Instead of turning left or right, he kept walking straight until he came, across the way, to another hall. 
This one was carved in the style of the early ancient Empire. 


Instead of swirling abstractions on the floor, there were columns and faces. There were figures embossed in the granite rock - slaves, cattle, brewers, butchers, weavers - enough obsequious faces to flatter the eternal slumber of any Solean Dynasty . 
Hill and Pyetle walked through them until they came to a stretch of graves dug into the wall. These were each sealed by a stone nameplate bearing the titles of a long-forgotten noble. 
Hill picked a rock and began to smash them in. Just a few hard blows was all it took.
“What are doing!?” Pyetle shrieked.
Hill continued to hammer away, shattering plaque after plaque. He would reach into the graves and sweep out a jumble of tattered woolen cloth and bone, then move on to the next. 
“Don’t do that!”Pyetle shouted.
“Why not?”
“They may be watching!”
“Let them watch. They’re dead. The selfish dits.”
“Fool! They might well be here!”
Hill stood up straight and looked around. “No see. No hear. No problem.”
“No problem? Don’t disturb them!”
“They are assholes. Assholes get disturbed. Heh.”
“Whatever these people did, their fate is yours if keep tempting it.”
“It’s not what they did, it’s what they are doing.”
“What are they doing?”
“Look at them!” Hill exclaimed, sweeping his arm out wide to point to all the graves.
Pyetle looked around expectantly. Squint as might, he couldn’t the slightest green shimmer of a wandering soul. He looked back at Hill in confusion.
“Where are they?” he asked.
“In the graves, idiot.”
“What of them?”
“These grelcha. They so indulgent. They so - how you say - full of themselves. Try to claim earth for all eternity.”
“You are mad that they built tombs?”
Hill nodded. “How selfish do you need? Steal a spot of earth even after you die. If I want that spot of earth I’m taking it. You dead. You not use. I will.”
“You’ll use it how? Are you going to crawl in one of these graves for a nap?”
“Oh, no. I do this on principle.”
“You do it out of spite.”
“What this mean - ‘spite’ ?”
“Your Common is too good to not know that word.”
Hill smiled. “Okay. I stop. Anyway, this not what I want to show. Come.” 
He led Pyetle further into the hall and stopped at a hole in the ground where part of the floor had given way to the abyss. It was about two lengths wide and it fell straight down. 
“What is it?” Pyetle asked.
“Listen to this.”
Hill pulled out his cock and began to pee into the hole. 
“Ew!” Pyetle howled. “You wanted me to watch you pee?” He grimaced and turned away. 
Hill snickered and kept at it. “You hear it?” he asked. 
Pyetle listened. There was no a-trickling splash. There wasn’t anything. There was silence. He looked over and saw Hill’s golden stream quietly speeding away into darkness.
“So what? It’s a deep hole. That’s what you wanted to show me?”
Just then, a tinny, zinging sound came echoing out of the hole.
zshhINGGGGgggggg
Hill looked back at Pyetle, smiling from ear to ear.
“Is weird noise, no?” he asked.
“Your urine made that noise?”
“What else?” Hill gave his cock a few shakes and put it away. “I think it have to do with how the rocks shape sound,” he said. 
Pyetle listened closely as the echoes ringed away. “I’ll have a go.”
“Yes! Go on.”
Pyetle handed Hill the torch then stepped over to the hole. He started to pull his cock out of his underwear, but stopped.
“Back up a bit, will you?” he said to Hill.
“Oh, sorry. Sorry. I Curious. You know.”
Pyetle shook his head and turned back to the abyss as it unfolded beneath his feet. He began to consider what it would be like to fall down it. How long would he hang in the darkness? As far as dying goes, he supposed the falling wouldn’t be so bad - but he didn’t like the darkness. He’d rather be able to see the bottom. There’d be something cathartic about falling for so long, a good ten seconds, knowing for at least that long that you’ve finally done it, that your fate is certain, its right there rushing up at you. That’s the moment he wanted frozen in his mind forever. 
His palms began sweat. He pulled out his cock and began to pee before the anxiousness could really have its way with him. 
Something brushed his shoulder. He screamed. He slipped. Urine sprayed all about. 
He fell into the hole.
Hill screamed after him. “Pyetle! shit!” He leaped so quickly to where Pyetle had stood that he almost fell down himself. He got down to his knees and lowered the torch down into the hole to see what he could see, but there was nothing but black.
“Pyetle!”
“I’m here!” 
Hill looked up to the ceiling and muttered a quick blessing to the Dreamer.
“I’m alright!” Pyetle yelled. “Your cloak snagged on something! I can’t reach it.”
“Don’t reach it, idiot!”
“Help me up.”
“Can you see me?”
“I can! I’m not far down. Lower a rope or something.”
“Hill! What are you doing?”
“Oh, Ayram! I was just… Pyetle - he pee into hole and then-”
“Ayram! Ayram, I’m stuck on a rock or something. Gods, I pissed myself.”
“Hill, why is Pyetle stuck in your piss-hole?”
“Don’t look at me! He jumped!”
“I didn’t jump! He pushed me! Well, he didn’t push me, he - fucking - I don’t know. Put a rope down!”
“Do you have rope, Hill?”
Hill shook his head.
“Did you just shake your head!?” Pyetle screamed up.
“You’re in a bit of a bind, Pyetle.” Ayram shouted down.
A drunken groan echoed up out of the hole. Hill put a wary eye on Ayram and whispered, “You have no big plans for him do you? He only a little old man. Little old cock, too.”
“Hill, he was your responsibility. That’s the second one you’ve disappointed. First Salavan, now this.”
“You can’t blame me for that! Or this! He was pissing… he jump into the hole!”
Ayram sneered.
“You can’t blame me for -”
“No, no. It’s the smell.”
“Oh.”
“Pyetle!” Ayram shouted.
“Yes?”
“I’ll lower down my bow as far as I can. That’s a few lengths, but you’ll have to climb up to it. I can’t see you, so I don’t know how far you’ll have to climb.”
Pyetle looked up at them - two dark heads cut out against the warm light, one much bigger than the other. He looked down into the unfathomable black. He wondered which prospect was preferable, up or down. Sure, he’d live if he climbed out, but living wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be. 
The cloak was snagged as good as if it had been sewn into the rock. Its threads were strong, tight-knit, and had been dry-waxed with a special unguent made from cow hoof, salt-sap, and spit, and Pyetle was as light as men come; there wasn’t a chance the cloak would rip any further. Not before he died of thirst. Or cold. He’d rather fall. Instead he just hung, legs and arms as limp as the rags of his tunic.
He curled and stretched his toes. He couldn’t see them. He twirled his feet.
“Pyetle. You climbing up? We not see.”
“Ayram!” Pyetle shouted.
“Yes?”
“Who are you?”
“What?”
“Who are you?”
“Are you climbing?”
“I’ll not climb until you answer.”
“Is he bargaining?” Hill whispered.
“Just spooked,” Ayram said.  Then he shouted down to Pyetle,  “There isn’t time for whatever the hell you think there’s time for.”
There was a moment of silence. Then Pyetle’s shrill voice came ringing up again.
“Who are you?”
“Climb on out!”
“I asked, ‘Who are you?’ ”
“Who are you?” Ayram asked in return.
“I am Pyetle! Who else could I be?”
“When I walked over here,” Ayram said, “all I saw was Hill shouting into a hole. Now a strange voice is shouting back. Pyetle might have fallen in, but he might have fallen to his death. You could be a demon lurking there in the dark!”
“Do I sound like a demon?”
“Aye, you do! 
Hill shouted down, “It be the way the rocks shape sound!”
“Hill!” Pyetle screamed. “Tell Ayram that I’m Pyetle!”
“We no can see you.”
“Climb on up!” Ayram shouted. “At least get high enough so that we can at least see who you are.”
“I can’t climb!”
“Why not? Do you have misshapen demon limbs?”
“The walls are smooth!”
“What are you talking about? There’s a crack here!” Ayram slapped part of the rock face where a deep crack ran down the side of the hole. “Doesn’t it run all the way down to where you are?”
“It does.”
“How wide is it?”
“About the width of three fingers.”
“Good! Perfect. It tapers down. It shouldn’t be too hard to climb up it.”
“I don’t know how to climb a crack!”
“Just stick your fingers in and pull down until they jam. Use your thumb for support or like a shim to get a tight fit.”
“Or stick your hand in side-ways,” Hill added.
“Yes, you can stick your whole hand in sideways and squeeze down. Get the meat of your palm and your fingers to stick.”
“Alright.”
“Squeeze, brace with your thumb, do what you can to inflate your hand in the crack so it’s nice and jammed.”
Pyetle spun himself round to face the rock. He reached up and stuck his fingers in and pulled down. He expected them to slip right out but they locked in place. He then felt out with his toes for a small cleft or angled face so that he could step and push himself up, but there was nothing but smooth undulations.
“What do I do with my feet?” he asked.
“Just stick them right in the crack. Keep your soles inward and your knees bowed out so that as you step up, your foot will naturally twist into the crack and jam in.”
“That sounds too easy.”
“It won’t be. It will hurt.”
As soon as Pyetle stuck his left foot into the crack he knew that it was going to hurt a lot. Even with a slight jam and twist, the rock threatened to rip his bare skin right open.
“I don’t think this will work!” he shouted up.
“You shouldn’t need to climb far.”
“Alright.”
Pyetle stuck his fingers back in and pulled again. He could already feel the skin starting to split on the sides of his knuckles. He stuck his right foot in the crack above his left. As he stepped up his foot twisted round and jammed in, but he hadn’t placed his hand high enough in the crack. As his body separated from rock face, his fingers started to slip out. He shot his other hand high into the crack to steady himself. Once recovered, he reached up even higher, high as could, and started again.
He did a little more this time to save his fingers. He groped around for a more relaxed fit, a more rounded edge. There was no saving the top of his foot. The bottom was calloused enough but the top of his foot’s skin was as soft and webby as pampered old woman’s.
He bit his lip and pushed up.  
“The crack gets wider!” he shouted.
“Yes. It tapers down.”
“It’s too many fingers!”
“Use a fist, then.”
Pyetle stuck his left fist in and wiggled his thumb around and pulled until it set. Up he went. With his next step he found he could fit his whole leg in the crack, up to his buttocks. He shimmied up like this until the crack got even wider, so wide that he could fit his fore-arm into a horizontal brace.
“Can you see me?” he shouted up.
“We can!”
“Well? How about it?”
Hill waved the torch around, trying make out more of Pyetle than the bald spot on the top of his head.
“You are not a demon,” he said, smirking aside to Ayram.
“How about you, Ayram?” Pyetle asked. 
Ayram stared down and Pyetle looked up. Pyetle can make out his eyes - just an immense figure. Even more sure that this wasn’t a simple human.
“On my word,” Ayram said, “I’ll tell you who I am if you climb up out of there.”
“Damn it!” Pyetle slammed his fist against the rock.
“Come on up, Pyetle.”
Pyetle shook his head and began to mutter to no one but the rock. 
“You losing him,” Hill whispered.
“Alright, Pyetle. Alright, “Ayram said. “You will come up if I tell you?”
Pyetle slapped his forehead against the rock. “Yes,” he said.
“Alright. But I can’t simply tell you.”
Pyetle looked up and asked, “Are you a demon?”
“No. You’ve no word in your language for me.”
“You aren’t a man?”
“Do you think I’m merely a man?”
“No.”
“And so it is.”
“What are you then?”
“My kind maps to form but not to language. I am something that is shown. I’m felt. Even across a distance - do you feel me now?”
Pyetle nodded. There was a pit in his stomach and it was filled with sorrow, rage, sdfaw.
“That is who I am. We have an accord, Pyetle, because you’re so lost. You’ve given up. I’m drawn to that. Without knowing it you called out to me, so here I am. We are in accord.”
“What does that mean?”
“Listen!” Hill shouted down.
“You are dead. As good as dead. Your life is torn and there is no putting it back together. Do you understand?”
“Yes.”
“Have I answered  your question well enough?”
“What do you want with me?
“You are a tool, and since you won’t use it, I am. I’m already pouring my will into you. You can feel it. Now climb out.”
“I don’t want to hurt people.”
 “You just killed a man!” Hill interjected.
 “Ignore the fool, Pyetle. You wont do anything you don’t want to do. Climb on out.” 
“Well. Okay then.”
Began again to shimmy up the hole.

 
Ayram grabs pyetle. Takes him under his arm. Something along the lines of  “Don’t want you jumping down any more holes.”
Pyetle was fine with it, because he was tired of walking.

‘Youve been quiet mandri’
Mandri mopes around.
Filling the shit.
Starting to lose it.

If I could go and kill the rich. 
And then what? What’s next? More rich. Everyone is only in it for themselves.

Pella liked to say that to be an Ayramun was to be tied to a wheel of pain the size of a calendar year. As it revolves it grinds the Ayramun into the frenzy of the fight, it mixes them with all the excitement and passion they can handle - but then it keeps rolling along and suddenly they’re pulled right out of the blood and guts and into interminable boredom of waiting for it all to come back around. Sometimes it’s more than a year until the next bit of action, sometimes it’s much less. The way the Ayramun operated meant there’d never be too much risk and so there’d always be too much waiting. It was only bearable because they never lost. But now, they’d lost half their number, and Ayram was unconscious on the floor of their cave.
To make matters worse, the blast that killed their friends had also destroyed the caravan’s wagons and whatever was in them. The pickings were so poor that they could fit inside a single man-sized sack. Only Mandri and Purloin bothered to sort it all. The two were busy at it by the fire.
“Still not found a scrap of gold,” Purloin complained as she pulled a half-shattered iron cookplate out of the bag.
“Not a fleck of it,” Mandri affirmed. 
Purloin, called Purl, was such a waifish, half-starved looking thing that she made Mandri look well-fed. She was also missing her right arm, a fact which leaned into the running joke that time was turning her into a lockpick, being so thin, knobby, and unbalanced as she was.
Mandri had already given up hope that there was anything valuable tucked inside the few rusted tinboxes he was pulling out of the bag. There was only the affects of men roughing it on long march: melted sticks of lye soap, cheap coins, spoons, and little levers for handmills. Junk. 
Mandri grew more and and more frustrated by the sight of each new trifle.
“I even scoured that crater,” he said. “Not a fleck of gold in it. Gold should have survived that blast. If a tin-box and barrel bands survived, gold should have.”
“No gold,” Purl moaned. “Even if we melt this all down, it comes to what?”
Mandri shook his head in disgust. “It’s not worth thirty Ayramun, that’s for  damned sure. This shit ain’t worth lookin’ at.”
Mandri stuffed the tinboxes back into the loot bag and tightened the drawstring as tight as he could. He then laced the opening so that nothing could fall out - not that it mattered if anything fell out.
“Honestly, we should toss this trash,” he said.
“It’s worth something,” Purl argued.
“Well I’m not hauling it. You gonna do it? You can hardly carry yourself.”
“I’ll get someone to help,” Purl said defensively.
“Get who? There’s like ten of us left.  All the stuff we need to carry, and you want to carry this shit?”
Purl’s sunken eyes glared out at Mandri. “I ain’t leavin’ that ambush with nothin’ to show for it!” she snapped. “You wanna leave thirty dead friends for nothin’, you go ahead. But I’ll make them count for somethin’, and I’ll bet theres at least one other who does too.”
Mandri shrugged off Purl’s indictment with a smile.“But that only makes it worse, doesn’t it,” he said. “Thirty dead for a pocket of silver somehow feels worse than thirty dead for nothin.” 
Purl rose to her feet and pointed her finger at Mandri. Her voice was thick with acrimony as she accused him of having no heart. “I bet you don’t even care and never did. You don’t like anyone. You say it all the time. I bet you don’t even care that Sentee, Cally, and Poor are dead. What are you even here for?”
“Oh, I don’t care?”
Mandrameen’s leather bag of scrolls was nearby, the one’s with the stories of the Ayramun. He reached in and grabbed a handful of them, and right of the top was Sentee’s. Hers was a familiar story - cast out into the Sand because of something she’d done. Then picked up by Ayram.
Mandri pointed out the thick letters he’d printed at the top of the page to Purl.
“You see this?” he asked her.  “This spells ‘Sentee’.”
He tossed the scroll into the fire.
Purl crossed her arms and feigned indifference.
“Ah yes, here’s Cally too. And Poor. And Jor, Iltwin, and For. They’re all dead, too. Won’t need these then. ”
“What are you doing!?” Purl shouted as Mandri made to toss them into the flames. Mandri stood there with a quizzical frown.
“Well, you say I don’t care, then I guess I don’t care. Spent all this time getting to know them, but your right, it doesn’t mean anything.”
“The hell is wrong with you?”
“You almost seem more upset at me for tossing these papers away, than at Ayram for tossing away their actual lives.”
The gall of Mandri’s words echoed around the cave, pricking the ears of any Ayramun who were trying to shut out the bickering. One by one they turned their eyes turned to the fire, squinting in disbelief, wrinkling their noses at the stink of Mandri’s insinuation.
Purl, for her part, was trying piece together what Mandri had just said. She’d heard him alright, but like the others, couldn’t believe he went at Ayram like that. She even tried to repeat the words, to dress them up with derision and trivialize the matter, but found she couldn’t do it. To blame Ayram for anything, when you knew him, was impossible. 
Mandri was starting to get a sense for the attention he was drawing to himself. 
“What? I’m just saying that it’s weak to try to make them that’s dead mean something when they don’t. Accept that they’re dead and they died for nothin.  Accept facts as facts - Ayram screwed up, put us out on bad info, and then people died. We lost. And when you lose you don’t get somethin’ for it so stop tryin’ to get it.”
“We didn’t lose,” Purl said through clenched teeth. 
Mandri laughed. “This sure as hell ain’t winning. What would you call this empty cave? Seems like a whole lot of losing to me.”
“We didn’t lose because this ain’t over.”
“And just what is all twelve pounds of Purloin the bone-bag going to do to the Empire?” Mandri asked.
“I’m going to do what Ayram said we’d do.” 
“Ayram? You still believe in him? In one night we’ve lost half of what we’ve gained in twenty years.”

The weight of the attention thrown at the fire knocked the two out of their little spat. But Mandrameen was a pure-blooded Jandrian, proud and resolute to the last. He would stand by his convictions. His voice rose to challenge the heightened tension.
“I’m not interested in merely surviving out here, if you can call this surviving,” he said. “If we’re going to die by the dozens, we should to be closer to Jeket, closer to the people whose lives we’re trying to change.”
Pella was near to the fire. Close to him. She was looking right through his skull with the eyes of a hungry lion.
“Yesterday, there was what, fourty of us? Today there’s fourteen. There’s over a million people in Jeket! Five hundred thousand spread out on the coast near Shul. We’re not the ones who are going to toss the Empire out of Jandri. If the war is going to be won, its the people who are going to do it.”
Pella spat into the flames.
“It’s Ayram that’s going to win this war,” she said. “I spent twenty years, longer than you’ve been alive, trying to stir Jeket into fury. Jeket… Jeket had a hundred years to do something about the terrors inflicted on them.”
Mandri scoured the blinking darkness for a sympathetic face. He need just one pair of eyes to match his gaze, to share his confidence and give it right back redoubled. But he couldn’t see well enough into the dark. If there was any agreement there, it was hidden in the shadows of their faces. There was only Purl and Pella. They, and the mage, were the only ones near enough to the fire for Mandri to read.
“You know, I used to be you,” Pella said. “Young and ignorant. Using every ‘mistake’ leadership makes as a prop for your own ideas. You just haven’t lived long enough to be disappointed by how the world works. I won’t hold it against you. But you need to shut up now.”
“Where’s the gold, Pella?”, Mandri asked.
“Sit down, boy.”
“I’m only asking a question. Where’s the gold?”
Pella “The gold is right here you idiot!”
“The mage?” Mandri asked.
“The MAZYDEI!” Pella croaked.
All eyes turned to the naked mage. The Mazydei. The Spark of the Schisma Guilds. General of the Empire. The most powerful being on the continent. To a cultish band on the edge of the continent trying to strike a blow to the Empire, he was the most valuable thing in the world.
“Yes. You sad, pitiful creatures.” Pella said. She then mocked their complaints. Not just Mandri either. She paced up and down the fire, scanning the darkness for sad faces as she mocked their wekness. “Boo-hoo, there’s no gold! All these deaths with nothing to show for it. I’m sorry to burst your pity party, but we’ve got a Mazydei in our midst. Does that not liven you up a little bit? Oh, now you’re speechless, Mandri? Does this not meet your criteria for success?”
Mandri’s mind was reeling at the revelation that there was a Mazydei on the floor of their cave. He’d only ever seen a Mazydei once, when he was a little boy. A Mazydei general led an Imperial column through the streets of his city of Belize. But that Mazydei had been a giant - ten feet tall and as stout as an ox. The twiggy creature that lay there helpless in the sand seemed another kind of thing altogether.

Need to say something that might convince sogasa that they wont kill him if he revealas himself. He thinks these are going to be bloodthirsty bandits. But whateves.</Text>

This was a regular outlaw. Pyetle was sure. A thief of thieves who was being punished for his crimes in brutal frontier fashion. Pyetle figured he was being shown a warning: this is what happens when you cross the Ayramun. Disobey, or lie, or cheat, or steal from us and we’ll slice you up and toss what’s left into a hole. No quick deaths. There will be pain. Pyetle thought it was a little dramatic. No need for it really, not for him. He wasn’t out there to try and make a little something for himself. The Ayramun had nothing to worry about. Not from him.
Pyetle tried to sleep but as soon as he closed his eyes he struck with visions of that foul creature squirming around right next to him. That was no good for easing into sleep. So Pyetle kept his eyes open and stayed ready to defend himself if necessary. He didn’t know what that near-corpse of person could do. Without hands it would wouldn’t be able to wrestle if it came down to it. No, the thing Pyetle was most concerned about was the thing bleeding all over him, and it was infected blood, clearly, that white pus had flakes of brackish yellow and green.
Pyetle tried to piece together a story about his cell-mate from the little details. First was there was the fact wasn’t a wrinkle anywhere on man’s skin. And it wasn’t really a man’s frame. It could be a woman’s, skinny and swervy as it was. Pyetle couldn’t be completely sure because the light didn’t go down below the navel. But there weren’t any tits. So Pyetle went with boy. Scrap the man. This wasn’t a man. Men had hair everywhere, and there wasn’t a single hair on this one’s chest, no happy trail, not even a tuft of fine hair rambling down his arm, though being caked in blood made it was difficult to tell. 
Pyetle could put most people to a place just by the color of their skin. In his long life he’d been to the major cities of the world. He’d been up north to the port of Zosa where the black folk held dominion. He’d been to the southern isles at Hra’aki where the white Hrkkans bundle up in furs against the cold. He’d been everywhere in between. From North to South, the colors of humanity had a mixing logic to it. Pyetle’s first instinct was to say that this boy was Hrkkan, but he was too pale even for a Hrkkan, too pale even for a Hrkkan shut in from the sun. Almost translucent. There were visible veins under the skin, not just on the underside of the arm but running all the way up it, and running across the chest and into the neck, spidering everywhere.  By the logic of skin this fellow must hail from somewhere even colder than Hra’aki. 
If he spoke then Pyetle was sure he could place him. Whereas skin is sometimes unreliable, accent always proves the picture. Pyetle found himself hoping the boy would wake up, that he might hear him speak, provided of course that his tongue hadn’t been pulled out with a pair of iron tongs.
But the boy didn’t make a sound. Not a whimper or a sob or an agonized moan. It was complete silence there in the cell, save for the faint echo of dripping water somewhere  outside in the cave. 
Just as Pyetle was beginning to wonder how close this creature was to death, the boy’s body convulsed and he threw a coughing fit. Blood and spittle flew. A few drops landed on Pyetle’s feet. He wiped them off on the rock .
 When it was over, Pyetle heard the poor wretch wipe his lips with the pitiful stump of his arm. Pyetle expected the thing to whimper and sob after such a brutal wracking, but the lad simply lay his head back down against the rock and sighed.
Then Pyetle noticed that the hairs on his own arms and legs were pricked right up. There was something in the air now, something his primal self could sense but he himself couldn’t. That’s when he saw that the young man’s eyes were open, wet orbs there in the darkness, looking, Pyetle assumed, right at him. Where else.
They were searching him over, studying him. Pyetle returned a weak smile, but felt foolish when he realized that he was sitting in the shadow and the young man probably couldn’t see it. They were just sitting there, the two of them, staring at each other in an uneasy bond of silence.</Text>

            <Title>Post Battle</Title>
            <Text>In the weeks leading up to the moment that Mandrameen quit painting - and quit society life in general - he’d laze the days away in the halls of a lesser Lord named Eruhd. He drank the Lord’s wine, stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and prickled lizard pluck, all while admiring the paintings of the Lady Fremel.
Mandri liked Fremel’s work. Well, ‘like’ might be too strong a word. He thought she was decent. She was a painter’s painter. That unfortunately meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite, and so her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred spirit. He was inspired by almost everything she did, and that included how she died: she killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea. Mandri had scribbled a few compositions of that, the moment just before the jump - the lady standing on the stone banister, her wind-blown, waist-length hair cradling her figure- but he could never find someone who was willing to put up the funds for the finished piece.
On one of these lazy days spent idling around in Eruhd’s halls, Mandri saw a curious sight: a Hrkan general was admiring Fremel’s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, and this was a rough and tumble man who’d clearly risen up from the ranks, a battle hardened freak, second only to the Mazydai in command, third if you include the Lords themselves -  not exactly the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. This general struck such a thoughtful pause before Fremel’s greatest work. The painting was titled, “The Shadow of Goriol Valley”, and Mandri wanted to know what the man thought about it.
Mandri’s take was that the painting was a work of genius. It was a view from the Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the low ridgeline which sheltered the valley from the eastern winds. The sun was setting behind the ridge, and so most of the scene was covered in shadow; blues, purples and muddy greys that appear warm and red against the cooler hues. Nearer the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek of blood-red water. That’s the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that’s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. Then dawns the realization that the water isn’t just blood-red, stained as such by clay or an algal bloom, it is literally blood, for the shadowed valley slopes above are covered by a carpet of corpses.
One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, crumpled over each other like a storm from the Abari highlands had ripped through the valley and dumped them there. 
Mandri walked up to the general and asked the man what had caught his eye.
The General said, “I was just thinking… I think this is the worst painting ever made.” 
Mandri would have laughed, but the man was being completely serious. Mandri would have tried to school him, but the man was who he was. Mandri briefly considered walking away, but soon he found himself asking, against his better judgment, “Why don’t you like the piece?”
The General looked at Mandri and said, “And who are you?” The implication being that Mandri didn’t have the station to request a clarification of thought.
“Oh, I just help keep the place clean,” Mandri said, “But, this is one of my favorite paintings. Why don’t you like it?”
“It makes a mockery of war. Whoever painted this has never truly seen a battle.”
“Oh, does it?”
The General said, “If you described to a child what happened in the Goriol Valley, and had them paint it, this is what you’d get. Obviously, it’s much prettier than what a child could do, but what it is, is naive.”
“I couldn’t disagree more,” Mandri said.
The general turned and glared at Mandri. The man’s face was filled with such contempt that Mandri wondered if he’d just insulted the General’s honor. The general shook his head, then walked away, his bootheels clacking on the marble floor in metronomic time. 
In the days and weeks and nights that followed, Mandri’s thoughts would drift to this incident and he’d try to parse the meaning of the word naive. Mandri assumed that if he ever saw the remnants of a battle that he’d understand what the old man meant, even if he didn’t agree.
Then came Minting Rock.
There were bodies everywhere. Half-buried bodies, half-, mummified bodies, and some bodies were only half-dead or crippled, writhing around, calling out for acts of ruthless mercy on behalf of the Ayramun.
Seeing it all laid out before him, Mandri couldn’t figure out what the general meant.
Naive?
This was exactly what the lady Fremel had painted. The only real differences could be marked down to a matter of style. Fremel’s dead bodies were almost seductive. That was just how people in her age painted them. It heightened the drama. The perfection of youth cut down by death. Well-muscled, naked or half-naked, and always absurdly clean to emphasize the pallor of death. They could have died wrestling in the dirt, and they’d be clean. The goal was to show lots of flesh, show the wounds, which in themselves almost sensual, thin stripes of red with a trickle of blood.
Real battle wounds were so much more visceral. Some of the dead a dirt nap, but others, well, the things that Ayram’s spud bar did to a body wasn’t fit for display in polite society. One Hrkan soldier had been whacked in the belly and that folded him completely in half, his spine bursting out his back, his face nestled neatly in between his knees. If Fremel had painted this man as he was, Mandri didn’t think he would have believed it. If she had painted a man missing his bottom jaw and had his turned completely around, Mandri would have supposed that Fremel should have brushed up on her anatomy. Bodies just don’t do that.
And it wasn’t just the Hrkans that had suffered.
Chopper had been gutted by a spear.
A  few others.
Sob had been unlucky. He’d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but the second had sent a leg-sized shard of sandstone whistling down from the heavens. If Sob had been standing a foot to either side, he would have been fine, instead, his body lay flat on the dirt and in the place of his head was a bloody spike of sandstone.
Of those still alive, the witch Elrahet was busy mumbling some witchy incantations as she laid hands on the dead. Purl was helping Seb splint his hand, which wasn’t too badly broken because it wasn’t swelling up like a wineskin. The rest of the surviving Ayramun - Ayram, Moto, and Moteah - were rushing around, trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. This included looting the dead, both Hrkan and Ayramun alike.
They pilfered anything that took longer than a day to make and could be packed up and carried; cords, ropes, belts, bags, and woven wool if it wasn’t too bloody. They wrapped it all up in neat packages, , organized to , a kind of care they didn’t show the bodies themselves. When Moteah got to Sob, she went through the pockets of his robe as if he were a lizard and she were digging through his guts for the pluck. The only thing she found of interest was a pair of pouches tied together by a leather string - Sob’s collection of lucky rocks.
Moteah dropped them as soon as she realized what they were. Then she muttered an unintelligible Zosan charm and rubbed her fingers in the dirt.
“Trying to brush the unluckiness off?” Mandri asked from his perch atop flat-faced boulder. “I thought you didn’t believe in luck.”
“I don’t,” said Moteah.
“Then what are you washing your hands for?”
Moteah stood up, hands on hips, and glared at Mandri like he was her child.
“Make yourself useful. Search those bodies for satchels with Hrkan rations. We’re going to be leaving soon.”
“And leave Sob like this?”
A shadow passed over Moteah’s face as she looked down upon her dead companion. 
“That is not Sob,” she said, and then she stepped aside and moved on to scrummage through the uniform of a dead Hrkan soldier.
Mandri hopped down and picked up Sob’s lucky rocks. These rocks were Sob’s life work. He thought it would seem a shame to leave them there to get buried by the Sand. 
Mandri stooped and patted Sob’s belly, saying, “Sorry about all this. I’ll take good care of these things. You’ll live on in these rocks, I swear it.”
Mandri took one rock from the ‘lucky’ pouch, and tucked it back into Sob’s robes, thinking that the man should be buried with at least one of them on the off chance that the Hrkan rhyme about the afterlife was true; 
	When you die, 
	The things you bring,
	Are the clothes on your back,
	And your wedding ring.
Since Sob wasn’t married, the only thing he had was his rocks. None of the dead Ayramun were married. Only Sob had rocks. 
Mandri scratched his chin and wondered if Sob would have gone to each of the Ayramun and give them a lucky rock. He found it difficult to carry out the will a dead man when he don’t know him all that well.
Did Sob even want him to have these rocks? It could be risky taking them, without assurances. 
The only person he felt comfortable approaching with this issue was Purl. So, he walked over to where she was finishing up with Seb, and asked her straight, “Do you think Sob would want someone to have his lucky rocks?”
It was Seb, not Purl, who answered. His manner was thick with the pretension. As usual. “If Sob didn’t want you to have them,” Seb said, “Then they wouldn’t have been there for you to take.”
“Sounds like comfort logic,” said Purl.
Seb’s brows pinched into a scowl. “No, it’s not. It is the truth! Things happen because they are supposed to happen. If they weren’t supposed to happen they wouldn’t happen.”
Purl rolled her eyes. She gave Mandri a knowing glance, a flutter, knowing glance, lingering long enough to say, “You and me are the only real people in this conversation.” It’s a look that’s meant to be a private aside, but she did it right in front of Seb, knowing he’d catch it, and when he did, his scowl turned into outright anger.
“Don’t roll your eyes at me, bitch!”
“I’ll roll my eyes at whoever I want to roll my eyes at.”
“Just because you can’t see the hand of god at work in the world, doesn’t mean it’s not there.”
Mandri bore  “Did you guys ever hear the story about how the temple of Salamis stole the legs of the Lybion martyrs from the temple of Geetz?”
“What of it?”
“The priests of Salamis said that the theft was justified because if Solraheen didn’t want Salamis to have such a sacred relic, then he wouldn’t have allowed such a theft to occur in the first place.”
“And they were right.”
“Priests stealing,” Purl moaned. “That’s what you get with comfort logic.”
Seb moved to mandri, knowing Purl was a lost cause. “Those rocks are yours now Mandri. And they’re yours because you have them.”
 Mandri mulled it over. If Moteah hadn’t put the rocks into his field of vision, he never would have thought about them otherwise. It was easy to imagine Sob’s lonely ghost hovering there above his corpse, compelling Moteah to pull the rocks from out of his robes, so that they might dangle there in the air like an ox’s uglies.
Maybe Seb was right. The proof that Sob gave the rocks to him was that he had them. That was the kind of circular thinking Mandri would have to accept if he was going to take the prophecy of the Incompetent Painter seriously.
He was lucky because he was alive, and he was alive because he was lucky.
He survived because he had a destiny, and he had a destiny because he survived. 
There was a certain freedom in just accepting it. A certain dry logic, too. Then there was the fact that he’d miraculously escaped death four times over now. At a certain point, after the miracle stack up,  .
“So these rocks are useless then.” Mandri said as he weighed the pouches in his hand.
 Seb asked, “What makes you say that?”
“If what is going to happen is going to happen, then luck doesn’t come into it. Sob couldn’t change his luck with lucky rocks, and I can’t change mine. We’re all going to end up how we’re going to end up and that’s that.”
Purl looks up with a skeptical look. “Is this about that whole ‘Painted Eunuch’ thing?” 
“No,” Mandri said defensively.
Sob eye’s lit up. “What painted eunuch thing?”
“It’s nothing,” said Mandri.
“Mandri thinks he’s some prophetic eunuch.”
“You’re a eunuch?” asked Sob.
“No.”
Sob eyed Mandri’s groin with some concern.  “Let’s see your uglies then.”
“I’m not showing you my... It isn’t about a eunuch. You can interpret the prophecy a bunch of different ways.”
Purl said, “A eunuch only means one thing.”
“Well, the prophecy was written in Old Jandri, and the way it’s written-”
Sob interrupted Mandri with a revelation. “Is that what you were doing dead in our ravine? Trying to fulfill some prophecy?”
Mandri shook his head. “Like I told Purl, I was killed and then dumped there.”
“Don’t lie,” Purl said.
“I’m not lying. A lunatic killed me thinking that I might be the Painted Eunuch, and according to him, the only way to be sure was to kill me.”
“To see if you’d survive it.” 
Seb was vibing with the logic.
“Don’t encourage him,” Purl said. Mandri wasn’t sure who she was talking to.
Seb seemed to think she was speaking to him. “If young Mandram does have a prophesied future, then he needs no encouragement from me. He is who he is.”
“Brilliant,” Purl said derisively. “Profound wisdom from Seb the Broken. ‘He is who he is’. Mmhmm.”
“Have you told Ayram about all this?”
“Why would I?”
“Because Ayram is superstitious man and he wants to know what Mandri was doing in the ravine.”
Purl sh
Then lets go! I want to see what he thinks of this.”
“Hoooold on. As far as I’m concerned, I have nothing to do with this whole Painted Eunuch thing.”
“Well, you’ve got something to do with something!”
This last profundity snapped something in Purl, and she smacked the ground with her pack and challenged Seb, saying, “You do understand that the words coming out of your mouth don’t mean anything, right?”
Seb grinned. “We’ll see what Ayram has to say.” He then stood up, put his crusty hand on the back of Mandri’s neck, and led him away.
Seb led Mandri up and over a pile of rocks, around a pile of bodies, and there was Ayram.
The giant was sitting on wooden stool, back turned, and the witch Elrahet was checking his body for wounds. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but the himself was perfectly silent as the old witch sewed up a thin gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the dust from his skin with a wet rag, revealing a tightly sculpted body - skin, muscle, and bone, not an ounce of fat, skinny and strong, like a dehydrated lizard. Every time Ayram lifted his arm, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.
“You should be getting ready,” Ayram grumbled when he heard Seb and Mandri approaching.
Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. “There’s a thing you should know about Mandri here. About what he was doing in the ravine where we found him.”
Elrahet snapped, “We don’t have time for this.”
Seb raised his bandaged hand and prodded the air with his one good finger. He said, “Mandri says he’s part of some prophecy about a eunuch.”
Ayram peeked over his shoulder with a questioning eye.
“What prophecy?” he asked.
Seb guided Mandri around to Ayram’s front and waved him on.
Mandri stood there, wilting under the weight of Ayrams glare. The tips of his beard were greased in blood.
“Explain,” said Ayram.
Mandri took a deep breath.
“Can I just say that, I’m not personally invested in any prophecy. The truth is that I’m just a poor farmer who was killed by the governor of Meskalim. The man was insane. He believed that I was something called the Painted Eunuch, and he said that the only way to be sure that I am the Painted Eunuch, was to kill me.”
Seb picked up the slack, saying, “Because if Mandri survived death, than that means he’s bound for a greater destiny. And look what we’ve done - risen him from the dead. Maybe he is this Painted Eunuch.”
Ayram leaned forward and set his elbows on his knees. He looked Mandri up and down and said, “He’s not a eunuch.”
Mandri opened his mouth to explain, but before he could, the old witch Elrahet popped out from behind Ayram. “The prophecy of the Painted Eunuch can be interpreted in a number of ways,” she said. “The Old Jandri word for ‘eunuch’ is the same as the word for ‘impotent’. Or ‘failure’. Or ‘incompetent’. Some say beware the Painted Eunuch, others the Eunuch Painter. Or, mayhaps, it is the Failed Painter. You say you are a farmer, Mandri, but did you ever want to be a painter?”
“Yeah, I’m something of a painter. That’s the thing that got Salavan all heated. I wouldn’t say I’m a failed painter, though.”
Seb wagged his finger at Mandri accusingly. “Just now you claimed you were a farmer.”
“I, uh… it’s a long story.”
Elrahet chuckled. “A painter working as a farmer is a failed painter. No one chooses to slave away in a field, not in Meskalim of all places.”
“Well, I did.”
Mandri said it with such conviction that even he believed it. Though it wasn’t enough. All three of the Ayramun looked at him with suspicion. Ayram most of all. The man’s gaze was . Mandri couldn’t hold for even a flutter of a heartbeat.
Ayram asked Elrahet, “What is this Painted Eunuch supposed to do?”
Elrahet said, “There are a hundred different prophesies fortelling how The Enemy shall awaken from his tormented slumber. The Painted Eunuch is one of them.”
Ayram’s suspicion turned to disbelief.
“This boy will be the one to arouse Schisol?”
“Indeed - IF he is the Painted Eunuch. And IF the prophecy is true.”
Mandri could really feel their stares boring into him. Seb was grinning, reveling in the awkwardness.
“Would it help if I promised not to do it?” he asked.
Ayram defers to Elrahet.
“What do you think?” he asked.
“I don’t know,” Elrahet said as she began to pace around in a little circle. As she walked she scuffed the dirt with the sandals, kicking small stones out in front of her.  Before finally declaring, “Ancient prophecies aren’t worth much. If he is or if he isn’t, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that it’s another sign of the changing tide. Plans are coming to a head. Schisol’s idiots are stirring. If they’ve gotten up as high as governor, then I’m sure they’ll try something stupid soon.”
“Then we cannot give up on the Mazyd,” said Ayram.
Elrahet nodded in agreement. “We may not get another chance.”
Ayram sighed and his shoulders slumped. He sat like that for a , then he slapped his knees and he was back to his old absurd confidence. He stood up, twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and when this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down his ribs, he ripped a long, thin strip of wool from a white Hrkan cloak and bandaged himself up . While he was tying the knot, he pointed with his chin towards two small corpses that were laying face down in the dirt.
“Grab those and bring them here,” he said, speaking to Seb and Mandri.
Seb pulled at Mandri’s sleeve and the two of them trotted over to the corpses and picked them.
One was the Mazydariga child. 
The other was Mazydobo.
They carried them back to where Ayram stood, and set them down at his feet. Then Elrahet waddled over and shooed Seb and Mandri away.
The old witch straightened the corpses out so that they looked like resting angels next to eachother, flat on their backs, and then she knelt in between their heads, making sure the layers of her robeskirt folded nicely to make a pillow for her bony knees. 
In her hands was golden blade. It flashed in the light of the sun as she held it up, she said, for the elder gods to see.
The sight of that dagger turned Mandri’s stomach. He’d seen one like it before, in the grip of that demon witch who’d swallowed his ox’s soul. The two blades were almost exactly alike; maybe they were the very same, Mandri couldn’t be sure. He’d thought that witch who’d chased him off his field was one of a kind, yet here was Elrahet, and while Elrahet hadn’t sprouted fangs, and didn’t fly around as if possessed by the wind, there was that same devilish excitement in the air.
Seb was feeling it too. His jaw hung loose and his eyes were alight with wonder.
Ayram had crossed his arms, apparently uninterested in , but the hairs on his forearms stood on end and his pink bottom lip was tense inside that greasy bushel of a beard.
When Elrahet next spoke, with her head craned towards the sky, the speech that ushered from her lungs was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the croaks of vomiting toads sounded so much like gibberish.
But it wasn’t gibberish, it couldn’t be, for the words pulled a shimmering, red smoke from out of the witch’s throat. The smoke wisped and curled like smoke from a candle flame, sending tendrils to wrap around the tip of the golden blade. Then, suddenly, Elrahet slammed the dagger down into Riga’s belly, burying it up to the hilt.
That’s when Mandri realized that the poor Riga child was still alive. It must have been drugged, for it could not speak or cry in anguish. It could only spit out blood. Then its body shuddered and it’s feet spasmed, its toes then curled, and its legs jerked. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga’s hips with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, Elrahet ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.
Mandri wanted to look away, but he couldn’t. Such is the allure of dark and twisted things. It made Mandri queasy, and still he couldn’t look away as witch slurped up blood and viscera from the hole in the Riga’s belly. 
When she’d had her fill, she pulled her head away from the Riga’s corpse, mouth shut tight, withered lips painted red with blood, and she swung around to kiss the lips of Mazydobo. She pried his mouth open, and spit what was in her mouth into his - blood, and a dim blue light, the same light that Mandri had seen zip out of Obo’s body when the Mazydariga whistled.
Then Elrahet shut Obo’s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set her ear against his heart. 
She closed her eyes and listened.
A stillness settled over those gathered there, and 
“Fetch Purl!” the witch said. “Quick!”
Mandri winced as Ayram yelled, “PUUURRRRL!”
A heartbeat later, and Purl came running into the clearing.
“What is it?” Purl asked.
Elrahet pointed to Obo’s chest and said, “Wake it up!”
“What? What do you mean?”
“There isn’t much time! Wake up the Mazydai!”
Purl hurried over and knelt next to Obo’s body.
“What do I do?” she asked.
“I didn’t make the creature. Will him awake! Or Something!”
“I don’t know what to do!” Purl said as her flustered hands waved in the air, “I don’t even know what’s going on.”
Elrahet grabbed Purl’s stubby left arm
“Try pumping your fist to start his heart.”
These words seemed to clarify the situation for Purl, and her confusion gave way, , to stern look of concentration.
Mandri couldn’t help but imagine Purl’s missing hand squeezing away at some misshapen heart in Obo’s chest, her dainty fingers clutching a hollow slug of a muscle, with a tangle of veins and arteries floating in an amnioticky goo. 
Squeeze.
Squeeze.
And squeeze.
Then, to the astonishment of all, Obo opened his eyes.
The sudden movement startled Purl and she stumbled back on her butt. Elrahet sent a shriek of thanks to the heavens, and Ayram 
“Welcome back,” he said.
He reached down and picked the Obo up with one hand, and set the Mazyd sitting against a boulder. 
Mayzdobo’s eyes were misted over. He was still coming to. Even so, he found the strength to speak. He said to Ayram, in his usual way, “The urge to gloat must be fierce.”
Ayram just stares him down.
“There’s nothing to gloat about here.”
Obo looked around as his head lolled about, and took in the scene. 
“I said you’d all die, you said you’d win. You were right.”
Ayram is like, this fucking guy.
“Purl!”
Purl runs up.
“Make him do something.”
“Do what?”
“Make him bark like a dog.”
Purl assumed the stance of a. Said, “Bark. Like a dog.”
Obo smiled, and in the most plainly human way, said, “Bark.”
“Did you make him do that?” Ayram asked Purl.
“I think so.”
Unsatisfied with Purl’s degree of certainty, Ayram turned to Mazydobo and asked him instead.
“Did she make you do that?”
Obo was still smiling. He was missing a bottom tooth.
“I am not sure how to answer that,” said he.
Ayram said, “Answer with the truth.”
“The truth is that if the girl didn’t tell me to bark like a dog, I never would have barked.” Obo eyed Ayram and Purl , in obvious if they were picking up what he was putting down.
It was Elrahet who spoke up. “Was her command sufficient cause to compel you to speak?”
“No,” said Obo.
Elrahet then said Purl, “Make him do something by thinking it.”
“What should I make him do?”
“Anything!” exclaimed Elrahet.
Purl shrunk under Elrahet’s , and took a deep breath to focus her nerves, and whistled it out through pursed lips. When she opened her eyes again, she was the perfect picture of composure. 
A faint hum in the air. From whence it came, Mandri could not tell. There was a north-easterly breeze which was not there before.
Purl reached out with her handless wrist, and then Obo’s bald head twitched. and his shoulders crimped then a golden glow began to shine through his pale throat and he opened his mouth towards the heavens.
Mandri expected to see a blast of sunfire issue forth, but nothing came. A heartbeat later, and Obo regained control of his senses.
He said, “I must admit, you almost had me there.”
Ayram crosses his arms.
“That’s good enough for now.”
“Is it?”
“It is.”
“Have you not learned anything from this day? Even if the girl could control me, you must see how I’ll be of no use to you.”
“What do you mean.”
“You have two problems. First, it is still an open question as to whether or not the girl can control me. Ask me? She never will. Second, even if she could, there’s still the issue of the Mazydariga. As you have seen, one whistle from a Riga and I go as limp as a noodle.”
Seb piped up from his in next to Mandri. “That’s a good point,” he said.
Ayram gave Seb a hushing look, then asked Obo. “How many Mazydariga are there?”
“I do not know,” Obo said. “More than you can handle would be a rough estimation.”
“He’s right,” Seb said.
Ayram grunted in Seb’s direction. 
“What is it you want me to do?” Obo asked. “Do you plan to use me to drive Hrk’s armies into the sea? Lay waste to every Hrkan temple?”
“There’s no point in telling him.”
“You should!” Obo agreed. “I am good at scheming. That is literally what I’m made for. Tell me your goals, the more specific, the better. What do you want to accomplish?”
Elrahet saw Ayram considering it, then decided to intervene.
“We can’t trust the creature,” she said.
“I don’t trust him,” Ayram said with conviction. “But either he says something sensible, or we simply ignore him. I don’t see the harm in telling him what we plan to do. The Mazydariga clearly want to kill him as much as us. Maybe he’s got an idea of how to avoid them.”
Elrahet skeptical glare.
“I’d rather move on with a plan than run blindly into a nest of battles.”
Ayram turns to Mazydobo.
“I wish to use you to kill Solraheen.”
Silence.
“I’m confused. Is there some Lord who has taken to calling himself Solraheen?”
“There is only one Solraheen,” said Ayram.
Mazydobo looked at each of the Ayramun to gauge their intent. So did Mandri. What Ayram was saying was absurd, even for a man such as he. One can’t simply a god.
Obo then said what Mandri was thinking.
“You can’t be serious.”
But Ayram was.
He said, “I wish to smuggle you into Jeket, sneak you down in the cavern temple, then have you open your mouth and spit your sunfire into Solraheen’s eye. I want you to end him as you can end a rock. Your sunfire erases things from existence.”
Stunned.
“Why?”
“You asked for a goal, not a motivation.”
“But this is the age of Hrk. Solraheen is merely a figurehead. You do understand that he’s stuck under a mountain of rock, right?”
“I do.”
“He can’t move. They keep him so drugged up on havi fumes that he can’t talk. Why risk everything for a symbolic victory?”
“It isn’t symbolic.”
“Sure, killing him might stir up chaos for a few years, but it won’t do a thing to change the balance of power in Jandri. Hrk will remain Hrk, and whatever side you’re on will still look and feel like this.” Obo motioned around him to the devastation that was Minting Rock.
Ayram was unperturbed. “Can you think of a way to elude these demon children and get you down into the tunnels of Jeket?”
“Please, for your own sakes, stop and consider: what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?”
“You?” Elrahet said.
“Well, yes, but in normal circumstances, no. In fact, we Mazydai we were created to massage that one thing that checks Hrkan power, and that’s the people of the Hrkan nation. There is no more destructive power on this earth than when the Hrkan people get angry all at once. And right now, they don’t care about the outland tribes. They don’t care about you. There’s sympathy there, if you can believe it. Kill their god, and it won’t be hard for the Lords to whip them up into frenzy.”
Ayram chuckled and shook his head. “I know what the Hrkan people are capable of.”
“Then why agitate them?” Obo asked. The force of his argument was working an energy into him. “If you want Hrk to fall, you have to be more surgical. There are strong internal divisions within Hrk. Apply some pressure to the right places, and you can irritate those divisions. Get the factions within Hrk to hate eachother. That’s the easiest way to conquer a nation, simply get them to no longer want to be a nation.”
“You speak as if from experience.”
“I’m a student of history. How do you think Hrk absorbed its tribes? What I can say from experience is this: getting people to hate eachother is the easiest thing to do. Disagreement is a natural reflex for your kind. Prey on that with a bit of coin and it starts a death spiral that feeds itself.”
“I don’t care about Hrk,” Ayram said. “What I want to do is destroy the body of Solraheen.”
“See, you say you want to do that, but killing Solraheen strikes me as a means to an end than rather than the end itself. If you tell me your desired ends, I might be able to find a less risky way of achieving it.”
“My desired end is Solraheen’s.”
“Then why use me? Why not just make a giant cleaver and drop it on his neck?”
Elrahet said, “It would grow back.”
“Would it?”
Ayram nodded. “It’s been tried.”
“When?”
“It’s been tried.” 
“Sure. Whatever. But why are you so certain that my sunfire will do the trick?”
“I’m not. Nonetheless, I wish to try.”
Obo smiled and laughed in disbelief. “Fine!” he said, relenting. “Fine.”
“Can you think of away around the Mazydariga.”
“First thing’s first, there’s the simple issue of: I don’t want to do this. You shouldn’t have told me. I’m going to do everything in my limited power to prevent you from achieving your goal.”
Elrahet glared at Ayram.
Ayram shrugged off her, crossed his arms, and said, “I’m not worried about what you want.”
“You should be,” Obo said. “Because your choice of Purl as Minder was a poor one. You should have gone with yourself, Ayram. You might be a capable Minder, but then again, that’s only a ‘might be’ and I’m not sure you’d want to risk losing your hand for no reward. The only other option is your old witch, Elrahet. I’m actually quite certain she’d be able to do it. I don’t understand why you didn’t use her in the first place.”
“She needs her hands.”
“In that case, it’s either hope Purl magically develops some resolve, or, and this was always possible, pay attention to what I want. Give me what I want, and I’ll gladly go along with all this. Without complaint.”
“What is it you want?”
“What I want is something that elegantly solves the problem of the Mazydariga. And that’s why I know this is the option you’ll choose, because the most elegant solution demands application.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“One distant whistle and the Mazydariga sucks the artificial Spark from my body, rendering me inert. And Jeket is crawling with Mazydariga, so even if you could control me, the Riga will have found me long before we reach Solraheen’s chamber. But if you give me what I want, none of this will be a problem.”
“I said get to it.”
“I want my freedom. I want my own true Spark. I want to be sustained by my own will. If I have my own shard of the divine, then I would be free from the Mazydariga’s influence, free from a Minder’s influence, and in return for this grand gesture, I would do as you wish, I will kill Solraheen.”
Ayram stroked his beard. 
He asked, “And how do I get you a Spark?”
“I was awake in the cave when your Elrahet put a Spark in Mandrameen’s body.” Obo waved towards Mandri.
“I did not believe such a thing was possible,” Obo said, “Yet there he is. If Elrahet could infuse Mandrameen’s inanimate matter with a Spark, then perhaps she could do the same for me.”
Ayram looks over to his witch and asked, “Can this be done?”
Elrahet steps closer.
“A Mazyd is a different kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving him one would require an act of divine creation, and that is a power known only to the gods.”
“Well then, if it can’t be done-”
“I did not say it couldn’t be done.”
Mandri’s ears pricked up. There was an implication in Elrahet’s statement that . As Elrahet loomed over Obo’s diminutive form.
“Tell me, creature, if I grant you a Spark, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from going back on your word?”
“Nothing,” Obo admitted.
Elrahet turned again to Ayram. “We can’t trust the creature. We’re better off stumbling blind through the desert.”
“I understand your concern,” Obo said. “Solraheen gave humanity a Spark, and now you set out to repay that kindness by killing him. You’re worried I’ll get the same idea.”
“Why wouldn’t you?” Elrahet spat.
“As you say, we are different kinds of creatures. Don’t project your own failings onto me.” 
Ayram pulled Elrahet away from Obo, as she was about to smack him in the face with her cane. Ayram assured her with a knowing grin and said, “Damned will be the day that I trust the Mazydai to honor words.”
Obo said, “
“If there is no other option for dealing with the Mazydariga, then there is nothing left for us to discuss.”
Obo held Ayram back with a wave of his hand. “There is one other option,” he claimed. “It’s just not as elegant as the first. Actually it was in your grasp just now, but true to form, you’ve managed to squander the opportunity.”
See how is insult lands.
“Out with it.”
“I don’t know this for certain, but I assume that when a Mazydariga is in possession of my pseudo-spark, my lifeless body becomes untraceable. Presumably, you could capture a Riga after it disables me, then you could walk right into Jeket with my corpse, unmolested. Then, standing before Solraheen, you could reanimate me as you’ve done just now, then carry on with your wanton act of deicide.”
Seb stepped forward again, “Wait, are you saying that we could have-”
Ayram interrupted Seb with a brusque tsk, then said, “We’d have to keep the Riga alive. We’d have to carry him all the way to Jeket. We’d be trading smuggling you for smuggling a Riga child. It’s one problem for another.”
Obo shook his head. “Again, I’m not completely certain of this, but I don’t think the Mazydariga can track each other the way they can track us Mazydai.”
Seb stepped forward again. He’d almost reached the conversation. “So we could have walked right into the Jeket if we hadn’t just-”
Ayram cut Seb short a third time, and the grim look on his face told Seb there would not be a fourth.
Obo answered Seb’s question anyways. 
“I don’t see why not.”
Ayram wasn’t as concerned with having unwittingly lost the keys to victory.
“If we’ve captured a Riga once, we can do it again.”
Obo tilted his head as if he hadn’t quite heard right. He said, “I’m not confident that you can afford another Minting Rock.”
To this, Ayram laughed. “You said we couldn’t afford the first one.”
“That’s a fair point. But unless you’ve got a small army of Ayramun stashed away for a rainy day, you lot won’t be able to stand up to what’s coming.”
Elrahet said. “We have plenty of friends in the desert.”
“What you don’t have is time,” Obo said. “More soldiers and rigas are on their way, and it won’t be a single column either.”
Ayram grabbed his spud bar and stepped out into the middle of the clearing, then wiped small circle of dirt clean with his foot. “How far out are they?” He asked Obo.
“It’s three days march from the outpost at Shahiz.”
“Shahiz…” Ayram mumbled as he drew a crude map in the dirt with his spud bar’s chisel.
Obo added, “And once the all the Riga figure out that I am still on the loose, and that their comrade is dead, the troops at Shahiz will be the least of your worries. ”
“How long will it take for them to figure that out?”
“They’re children, so it may take a day or two for them to reason through the implications of my still-beating heart, but once they do figure out, every Hrkan army from here to the shalbrumont straight will be stirring. You’ve kicked a hornet’s nest.”
Ayram finished drawing the map and began to pace around it. 
“Where is the nearest Hrkan outpost to Carkoon?” He asked.
“Redrock,” Obo answered.
“That’s what, two days west of it?”
“Three.”
Ayram added a dot and an arrow to his map. Elrahet stepped over and nearly spat. “I thought you said you wouldn’t trust his word.”
“I’m not.” Ayram said. “I already know all this. I’m just seeing if he’d lie about it.”
“Was he lying?” asked Seb.
Ayram erased his map with a flick of his foot, ignoring Seb’s question altogether.
“It can be done,” said. “We can make it to the bones of Ullr before the Hrkans get to us. It will be close, so we have to leave right now.”
Obo was not impressed. “If you wander into the Ullr basin… It’s surrounded by Hrkan cites… There will be no way out.”
“I know a place. We’ll use the Mazyd as bait to snatch another Riga, then we’ll waltz right into Jeket.”

Into this peace, Moto and Moteah came strolling in, each carrying packs twice as big as themselves.
“What’s going on?” Moto asked.
“We’re leaving,” said Ayram, and then he and the others walked right on by the siblings, sparing little in the way of explanation. Ayram gave a perfunctory nod and that was it.
Elrahet was the last to pass by. She stopped next Moto and said, “Bring that cursed Mazyd with you.”
Moto then said to his sister, “You heard the woman, bring the Mazyd with you.” Then he took off after Ayram, leaving Moteah, Mandri, and Mazydobo to sort it out.

Mention Legless Obo earlier on.
Early RMEMBER - MANDRI DOESN”T LIKE ANYTHING.

Mention Obo seeming out of it to set up him being ‘asleep’ in the next chapter.

OKAY - so Elrahet puts in a stopper to prevent the spark from being pulled.
—— so that riga doesnt work on him - still can be tracked.



I heard the crunch of the bone, and it ripped the tendons and the muscle and the nerves and my whole hand just crimped up like that.
Claw ripped a five inch gash into the side of his head, scalping him, and his eyes immediately filled with blood.

The Empire is just a tool. We want the same thing. Murderers, rapist, thieves purged from the earth. The Empire was created for this purpose - a single culture that can bind the people together. For as long as there are other cultures, a suffuse of races, there will be excuses in the minds of men to murder, rape, and steal at demonic scale. That is Our purpose - to elimnate parochial altruism, to eliminate fear of the Other, by eliminating not ‘The other’, but the very notion of otherness. And the Empire is just a tool to do it - you must see that. If another, better way makes itself known, we would take it. But there is no other way.

            <Text>Mandrameen had never been raised from the dead before. If he had known such a thing was possible, then perhaps he would have noticed how it felt to be reinserted into Nature’s causal flow. It’s a sublime sensation, a staticky prickling at the edges of the subconscious as the Divine Spark reasserts its grip on the body. The Ayramun call it ‘Sheldruub', which is an Old-Jandri word for the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets blown inland during a world storm. Entire beaches get covered six feet deep in that salty brown foam. When the storm passes and the sun peeks out, the air gets filled with the white noise of a hundred trillion foam bubbles popping. Its not loud, its just there and ever-present under the familiar sounds of nature; the wind blowing and the waves crashing and the gulls cawing overhead. When the foam disappears so does the static and all that’s left is solid ground.
 Mandrameen didn’t notice the Sheldruub. And he didn’t notice the warm blood tickling his insides back into working order. No, he was certain he was dead and that this was the afterlife. All the other surface sensations pointed towards the fact that he was a cold corpse. The skin on his shoulders shivered and the hairs on the back of his neck stood on end. His nose was numb and his lips were cracked and stinging. On top of it all there was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. It was the exact same smell that ruined his every summer, because the space under the floor of his bedroom was a popular summer destination for old rats looking to die. He wasn’t allowed to throw out their stinking corpses because he’d have to tear up the mosaic floor to get at them. His father told him he could either endure the smell or sleep outside, but the first night Mandri slept outside, the summer spawn of gilt flies got at him. When he woke up, half his face was covered in hard, red welts the size of fingernails; the other half had been safely nestled in his pillow. 
So the only real option was to endure the smell, and endure it he did. This is not to say that he got accustomed to it. The smell of death was always dreadful, always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.
He could not move. Dead things don’t move. Yet he could breathe, and dead things don’t breathe. His breath was icy coming out of his throat. He tried again to move but neither his legs nor arms would bend. It got to a point where he wasn’t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn’t truly feel them. He couldn’t even roll his body this way or that.
Just as he was coming to terms with the fact that his mind was decoupled from his flesh and his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing body, he found he could open his eyes. It was difficult thing to do as they were caked shut by the crust of slumber. They opened slowly, and Mandri was almost disappointed. As soon as they were wide enough to parse the caught a glimpse of where they were, he shut them tight again.
He was lying flat on a floor of a cave lit by flame. 
Surely, he thought, this is the Underworld.
He snuck a peek to make sure, and sure enough, it was a natural cave - not a quarry or mineshaft or one of the rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Zagros. The texture of the sandstone was a study in contradictions: it was smooth and craggy and porous all at once. The ceiling was low, and the walls bulbed out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others. 
There are stories that say the Underworld is a giant pit under the earth where the blackness that is the soul is cleansed from the Spark by fire. In that pit is a tornado of flesh and flame and ringing out loud is a chorus of screams, the like of which can turn a man mad if he’s to hear it before his time. This didn’t quite fit that. For starters, it wasn’t a pit. And it wasn’t burning flesh he smelled, it was rotting flesh. He was trapped inside his own rotting body which was itself trapped inside a bubble of rock.
His mind’s eye conjured a different image of the Underworld. One where the rock under the earth is riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse, and everyone is forced to endure the mire of their own stench for eternity. It wasn’t a vision of the afterlife he’d ever been taught, but then again, he always supposed he’d never been taught the correct one.
Mandrameen summoned the courage to open his eyes again. This time he found he had the use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket and was lying on a bed of straw. He thought it was strange for such a place as the Underworld to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of the flame, and was relieved to see that it wasn’t a jet of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth, it was a regular copper oil lamp sitting in the middle of this little cave. 
On the other side of that lamp, however, side-slumped against the limestone, was the most disturbing manlike creature Mandrameen had ever seen.
It was not human. It had arms and legs and the right skeletal structure, and its naked skin was pale and white like a Hrk’s, but the thing seemed as much like a giant hairless mouse. Mandri could count its ribs and the notches along its spine. It’s stomach was grossly distended, extruding out from its abdomen that it lolled over its scrawny thighs and onto the floor. Its chest was short and cramped and this drew the shoulders inward, giving the thing a hunched appearance, like it was better suited to walking on all fours, dragging its belly like a pregnant mouse as it went. Though its skin clung tight to its flesh, there wasn’t the slightest hint of a vein or artery anywhere. It was all sinew, skin, stomach, and bones. Mandrameen thought it was a ‘him’, but he wasn’t sure, for the creature’s groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of genitals. 
Mandri would have figured it for a ghoul if its face weren’t so smooth and fair. Its was reminiscent of an articulated mannequin that Mandrameen’s mother had given to him as boy, which was a wooden thing held together with copper wire and could hold a dynamic pose long enough to be drawn. The creature here in this cavern had a similar look - a generic Hrkan head, with even eyes, a straight nose, a thin mouth, all in symmetrical and genderless proportion. Its expression was identical to the wooden puppet, locked in a sterile stare. 
Thankfully, the thing wasn’t looking at him. It was preoccupied with the grievous wounds afflicting its body. Mandri could just make out a long line of stitches running down the middle of the creature’s chest, forming a suture that was caked in blood. Two stitches at the bottom had burst, leaving an open slit just below the sternum - but that wasn’t even the worst of it, for the creature’s hands had been cut off at the wrists. In their place were blood-stained poultices wrapped tight with cotton bandages. The hands themselves, spindly and long-fingered, were sitting in a far corner of the cave, one stacked on top of the other, like a pair of gloves ready for work.
It was some kind of ghost, Mandrameen was sure. It was either one of Moon’s creatures, or a fallen star. Or, Mandrameen feared, this was a human like him. This was what Mandrameen would become. All recognizable details that made Mandrameen, Mandrameen would be ground into oblivion. All laugh lines and moles and fleshy color and shaggy hair, it would all be cut out and smoothed over until all that is left is this expressionless puppet in the general shape a human being. 
If he were an architect of the Underworld, that was how he would do it. Those without virtue should find terror in its place, and an eon of terror would turn a person into this creature. And it made sense to heal the wounds after inflicting them. Mandrameen understood the power of contrast. He’d make sure it wasn’t all-torture all-the-time, because then the pain would lose its meaning. There would need to be moments like this of healing, of hope. He would go further than this, he would put moments of outright pleasure in. Such highs would make the lows, lower and make the terror more complete when its ripped away.
He’d also make sure the torture fit the crime. Like this creature here had clearly been a thief. Cutting off the hands was a common enough punishment up on the surface, perhaps down here all thieves were doomed to have their hands lopped off and then regrown and then lopped off again. 
The chest wound was a less obvious bit of imagery. The stitches ran over the heart so perhaps it was a crime of passion. Mandrameen didn’t think much of it because he was more concerned with what his own torture would be. With nothing to do but lay there and think, he thought long and hard about his sins. There weren’t many of them. Nothing at least to warrant being impaled on a spike or thrown into a lake of fire. 
His death was a suicide, but he didn’t think that was some unshoulderable sin. Who was he harming? His father hated him, his mother was dead, and no one else even knew he existed. Harming himself? Solraheen could not sit in judgment of a young man trying to find a bit of peace. If only the only way to find that peace was to hike out alone into the baking Sand, then what does that say about Solraheen’s creation? 
But everyone knows that suicides go to the Underworld. They don’t get buried. Their names are shushed and spit at. “How selfish” some people say, as if they want to do it too, but don’t out of a twisted sense of social obligation.
Mandri told a teacher once that he was going to do it. The teacher, a bald and wiry old man, gave him the dimensions of a square cistern and asked him to find how much land could a depth of 12 feet irrigate. Mandri said he’d rather kill himself than figure the answer. He said it with complete sincerity, and he was type of child who’d play with people like that on the way out. The old man saw it for what it was, called Mandri a petulant child and slapped him hard upside the head. He threatened to do it again if the boy dared to make light of the gift of life. 
Now that was a problem Mandri wanted to figure out. That old man honestly thought that beating a suicidal kid would do some good.
How?
Why?
If Solraheen truly wanted to torture him, the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like his teacher, people who have no conception of what it’s like to live in someone else’s skin; the truly selfish bastards, abusive old folk, violent assholes, doctors who reduce destructive emotions to mere tremors of bile in the stomach (take a bit of mari leaf, Mandri, and you’ll feel right as rain). Ignorant, dumb, vain people. And oh, don’t worry, Mandri counted himself among them. He was as much a ‘people’ as anyone, but at least he had the good sense to admit it. 
This wasn’t the surface, though, and this creature across the cave certainly wasn’t his old teacher. In such a case, Mandri could think of only one other punishment that would be ‘on-theme’ with suicide: he would be made to hurt himself. 
Somehow this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own head into a lake of fire. There was an infinite class of willful deaths for an artist of the Underworld to play with. Only, Mandri wasn’t sure how they’d get him to do it. He wasn’t some Solean penitent who took special delight in the ‘cleansing awe of pain’. He might be forced to ingest some mind-controlling substance, or be strapped into a hellish contraption of iron, knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him stab himself. 
If he even had an arm to bend.
He looked back down at his body. There were forms under the blanket where his arms should be. Then he saw his fingertips sticking out from under the sides, and like what happens in a dream, as soon saw them and knew that had them, feeling flooded into them. Suddenly, he had arms.
He threw the blanket off and saw that his whole body was more or less how he’d left it; a little bruised but it was all there and functioning, not black and rotting. He could wiggle his toes. And he was still dressed in his blue tunic, which was still dusted red from the clay of the Hias road.
He looked over at the ghoulish creature and the thing’s eyes were on him now. It seemed surprised. Mandrameen wondered if he was supposed to do something, speak to the creature, but decided the best thing to do was to try and see if there was a way out of this place. 
He stood up, slow and deliberate, hands showing, careful not to make any sudden movements. He felt his way along the sandstone towards his right.
After a few steps he could see that the rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri went back to his left, keeping close to the rock, staying as far as he could from the pale creature that was watching him with curious intent. 
To his left, hidden from the flickering lamplight, was a wide crack and what seemed like an opening that he could shimmy through. He put his arm into it, and his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his straw bed.
There was only one way left to explore. There was a patch of darkness near the creature, a spot where sandstone bent backwards and the weak lamplight could reach. Mandri’s eyes strained to see if there were a glimmer of rock, or if the darkness really did go all the way back.
The creature shook its head. 
Then it spoke. Its voice was shockingly clear, free of the rankling pain it must be feeling. 
“There’s no way out that way,” it said. “There is an opening that leads up, but it is not something you can fit through. Just another cranny for bats.”
“Bats?” Mandri asked. The word flew out of his mouth without him realizing.
“Yes. Bats,” the creature said. 
It pointed up with the stub of its arm.
Mandri looked up. There, clinging to cracks in the rock ceiling, were a dozen or so furry black blobs. Bats. Some were longer than the palm of his hand. He’d never seen their kind before. He’d only heard stories about them, mostly creation stories, like how Lahoraheen summoned creatures out of the night to haunt the skies, and out came bats. 
One of them dropped from its spot and flew into the unexplored passageway, silent as the darkness which swallowed it up. 
Mandri closed his gaping mouth.
Wanted to walk past. Would need a stiff bit of lumber lashed to his spine to keep him upright.
Best not to talk to a might-be-a-demon.
Best thing to do was sit right back down on that bed of straw, wrap that blanket around his shoulders, and pray that it was all a dream, or else pray for deliverance.
Mandri crept back along the wall to his spot of straw, back hunched, almost bowing in obeisance to the creature as he went. He knew now that it was no mere creature, and not a husk of a human being either. There was a depth in its eyes and it could speak, and there was even affectation in its voice, an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Most of all, despite its pitiful state - the scrawny frame, the bruises, the scar, the missing limbs - there was a liveliness in its spirit that outshone his own.
No, in this place, Mandri was the creature.
He sat down, made the blanket into a shawl, and tried to meet the creature’s eye. 
He couldn’t.
The creature saw him look away.
“I’m not going to hurt you. Not that I’d be able to. I don’t bear anyone ill will.”
Mandri pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders, and asked, “Are you a demon?”
The creature smiled. He had human teeth, flat, clean, white, and even, radiant even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs. But this meant nothing. He’d heard that some agents of the Dark wield beautiful, disarming smiles. Too ugly - demon. Too clean and perfect - demon. This one here was a mixture of the two; the body was a perversion of the human form, the head a .
“Why do you think I’m a demon?”
“Your body.”
“My body?”
“It is a perversion.”
“A perversion of what?”
“The human form.”
“Well! Is it? Well. My name is Oro, nice to meet you, too. What is your name?”
“I’m not going to tell you my name.”
“You’re under no obligation,” the creature Oro said, “but sharing one’s name is a friendly thing to do.”
Mandri paused.
“And what would you do with it?”
“What is it you think I would do with your name?”
“Whatever it is demons do with names.”
“What power do you think a name has?”
Mandri shrugged. He’d heard stories. Some peoples keep their names hidden even from family. They walk around with clay cylinder’s around their necks that functioned as names.
“How about this,” Oro said. “Don’t tell me your name. What utterance should I make to grab your attention?”
“I don’t want you grabbing my attention.”
Oro leans forward. The hand was his own fault.
“You feel threatened by me. But what am I going to do? Amble over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? The horror. No. I look strange. Get over it. I am not a demon.”
“I’m not going to tell you my name.”
“Then I will make up a name for you.”
“Go ahead.”
“I shall call you Chit.”
“Chit?”
“You look like a Chit.”
Mandri found it absurd. “What does a ‘Chit’ look like?”
“Mothers who love their sons a certain way will name them Chit. Chitawaree. Pampered boys. They become dour boys. A mousey look. Liable to think too much of themselves.”
“I don’t think too much of myself.”
“Oh?”
“Nobody one hates me more than me.”
“I find that hard to believe.”
“Believe what you will.”
“Unfounded certainty. So typical of a Chit.”
“I’m not a ‘Chit’.”
“Well, you are.”
Pause as Mandri is like, this dude is fucking with me.
“Fine. It doesn’t matter, anyways. There’s only the two of us here in this little hole in the Underworld. Call out any name you like, and I’ll be the only person to answer.”
“Again with the certainty. You think that there is only two of us down here. You are so certain of that. And - ah, yes, there’s that certainty melting away. Wonderful. You were so certain just then, and now you are beginning to think you might be wrong.”
Mandri looks around. If he missed the bats, maybe he missed something or someone else. He eyed the cleft of darkness that he’d been too afraid to check, the bit near Oro.
Oro smirked, and said. “No, he is not back there.”
“Stop playing games,” Mandri demanded.
“Then listen.”
“Listen for what?”
“Calm down, and just listen.”
Calm down. Moment of silence. Then Oro starts snoring. Arm stump directing the pitch in and out. Directing Mandri’s attention to the steady rhythm. Then he caught it, faintest of faint sounds, echoing out of the crack in the wall to his left.
“There’s someone out there.”
“Yes.”
“Who is it?”
“Our jailer, I suspect.”
“Is it a demon?”
Oro, bemused. “Not unless a demon’s snore sounds exactly like an underweight Jandri man who’s spent too much time chewing on karkle spines.”
“You can tell all that from just a snore?”
“Karkle juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that - you hear it? Gives the snore that wet, kind of sputtering lilt.” 
Oro leaned back against the rock. “Tell me, Chit, why do you think everyone down here is a demon? These bats, are they demons too?”
“Sure. Creatures of Lahoraheen. Creatures of the Dark. Natural for them to be roosting in the Underworld.”
“There’s that again, ‘the Underworld’. You don’t mean, the Underworld Underworld, do you?”
“Of course I do. Am I not dead?”
“Do you feel dead?”
“No,” Mandri said firmly. “But who is to say what being dead feels like. If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder - so then yes, I do feel dead.”
“You are not dead.”
“I am dead,” Mandri said flatly. “I remember dying.” 
“You were dead. At present you are very much alive.”
“I was dead?”
“Yes. I was asleep and you were dead. Then your heart started beating. It beat so loud that it woke me up.”
“You brought me back?”
“Oh I had nothing to do with it. To be honest, I did not know human hearts could restart.”
“They don’t.”
“So I believed. Yet, here you are.”
Mandri instinctively doubts that Oro could hear his heart, though he could hear the man snoring outside.
“So what are you then? Are you dead?”
“No. I’m not alive, either. I am, in the words of my master, ‘merely animated tissue’. Or more aptly, ‘Energized meat’.”
“You are a demon then!”
“What? No.”
“You talk of your master. You are neither alive nor dead. You are not human. You are serve the Dark God.”
“If by ‘Dark God’ you are referring to king of Hrk, then you are correct. But I think you are thinking of Lahoraheen, no? Ancient God of the night. Buried under the earth. Judge of the damned.”
“You serve the king of Hrk?”
“That it what I said, yes.”
The wheels start to turn. Perhaps.
“Are you one of the Mazydai?”
“I am indeed. Mazyd Oro is my full title. Just Oro to friends. Pleasure.”
“You lie.”
Oro laughed. 
“Again, Chit, you can’t reveal the of the truth of a matter through sheer certainty.” 
“How do I know you’re not lying? How do I know you aren’t a demon, and that the snore outside isn’t a demon. I died. I know that I died and you admit as much. Then I wake up in a cave underground filled with bats and a wretched creature who pesters me. You expect me to believe that this is not the Underworld? You expect me to tell you my name?”
“You really think this is the Underworld?”
“I do.”
“Why do you think that life after death should be so much like the regular old world? There’s an infinite class of cosmic realities and you think that when you die you go to… this? A dark hovel under the earth? Not a colorful explosion of , not a infinitely recursive pattern bluring the , no, when you die you go to a cave, the kind just like the. Let it never be said that the mind of a Chit lacks originality.”
“Then what is this place if not the Underworld?”
“The regular old world.”
“fuck off.
“You don’t believe me.”
“Believe a demon? No.”
“That’s okay. Don’t believe me, believe the bats.”
Contorted his face 

“These bats are not demons. They are simple bats, bush-tailed bats. You can tell from the way their wings attach to the spine instead of the sides, and, well, by the bushy tails.”
“So?”
“Do you know how many kinds of bats there are in Jandria? Hundreds. There’s more kinds of bats than there are kinds of dog, or cat. Or any other furry creature for that matter. Why should it be that there are bush-tailed bats in the Underworld, bush-tailed bats and not, say leaf-eared bats or black-tipped bats.”
“They’re just bats.”
“Tell me, Chit, where did you die?”
“What does that matter?”
“Just answer.”
“I died in the Sand.”
“Where in the Sand? Near the Junei Pass? The Eastern Hias?”
“Yes. But a demon would know that, wouldn’t he?”
“I know that because Bush-tailed bats live in the Hias. They sleep all winter and then they come out at spring to feast on the nectar of redberry blooms, and only redberry blooms. Unlike most bats, they aren’t opportunistic feeders. There’s only one place on the whole continent where redberry bushes grow - on the slopes of the Eastern Hias.”
“What’s you’re point?”
“You died in the Eastern Hias, and your body is still fresh so you couldn’t have been dead long, meaning your corpse couldn’t have been carried far. Then you wake up in an underground cave near some bush-tails, and bush-tails roost in the caves of the Pitted Portion, right next to the Junei Pass.”
“So?”
“What’s more is that you wake up next to me. I have no Divine Spark and so I cannot, by my very nature, die and go to the afterlife. Taken all together, is it not conceivable that you are not in the afterlife, that your dead body was found, brought down here, and then, through unknown means, brought back to life?”
“And who would have done all this?”
“I assume it was done by the same people who brought me down here.”
“And who are they?”
“Not entirely sure. I thought you were one of them until you opened your mouth. Haven’t seen them except from a distance. Thieves of , zealots of a kind, could be band outlaws. They laid an ambush for me on an old smuggler’s road, just outside the Junei Pass. There was a battle and somehow they overcame me. The last thing I remember is an explosion of rock. Then I woke up here, all cut up, like you see.”
“You were ambushed on a smuggler’s road? Was it Scuttle Road?”
“That is the one.”
“I died on Scuttle Road.”
Oro’s eyes widened for the first time.
“Did you get a look at your killer? Did you know them?”
“I said I died, I didn’t say I was killed.”
“Then how did you die?”
“I just… died.”
“Was it the heat? Thirst?”
“More or less.”
“Were you by yourself?”
“I was.”
“That seems foolish.”
“I was trying to die.”
“Oh. Well then,” Oro grunted. “Not foolish at all. You accomplished exactly what you set out to do.”
“And yet, here I am. Alive again. Or so you claim.”
“Yes, Chit, that is what I claim.”
Mandri chafed under the weight of Oro’s . No M
“See, a Mazyd lord wouldn’t be so petty. They are regal people, and you stoop to name-calling.”
“If you recall, not two fingers ago, you told me to call you any name that I like.”
“I did, but… but you didn’t have to be all snooty about it.”
“You insult my appearance. You call me a demon. You are unwilling to accept the truth of your situation. You are completely without empathy for my own plight. As of now you’re deserving of nothing more than Chit.”
“If you truly are one of the Mazydai, then prove it - spit golden fire.”
“I was recently robbed of that ability.”
“Then do something else.”
“We have only the one perceptible power. Other than the body, which you take for a demon’s, the only perceptible difference between me and you is that I am willing to accept when I am wrong.”
“Aren’t you supposed to know things that normal people don’t know?”
“We are learned creatures, yes.”
“What happens when we die?”
“On that, we Mazydai are invincibly ignorant. There are some conflicting reports, and to no one’s surprise, these reports are unreliable. I should ask you that question, seeing as you’ve been there.”
“I died and woke up here. If I went anywhere while dead, then I don’t remember it.”
“Then perhaps that is how it is.”
“I don’t think so.”
“Why not? Why does death have to be different than an undreaming sleep?”
“Because people need to be punished for the things they did wrong.”
“Do they?”
“Yes.”
“Divine justice?”
“Yes.”
“The gods don’t seem too concerned about justice in this world, so I don’t see why they’d be concerned about it in the world hereafter.”
“Punishment is the only way it does make sense. If people can go and do whatever they want to other people and not face consequences…”
“Yes?”
“That would be horrible.”
“Horrible. Terrible. You might say, unjust.”
Mandri nodded.
“The only way that I could believe that this is isn’t the Underworld, that this is all real, is if this is my punishment. I went against the word of the Septuagint and committed the crime of self-harm. I tried to escape this world, and so, it would be fitting to send me right back. Poetic, in a way.”
“First you think the gods care about justice, now you think they care about poetry?”
Mandri sneered at Oro’s bigotry. “What do you know about the gods?” Mandri said. “You don’t even have a Spark.”
“You admit that I am not a demon?”
“You know what I mean.”
Oro chuckled. “Well, you are right, I don’t know much about the gods. The one thing I do know, however, is to never assume that anyone thinks and feels the same way that I do about anything - and that holds true for gods especially.”
“That’s only true because you were not made in their image. Why should you think and feel as they do?”
“That is true, humans created me - and yet, I am nothing at all like you. There is some resemblance in physical form, but beyond that, I can assure you, the only thing we share is the ability to speak.”
“You seem human-like.”
“A moth seems leaf-like.”
“What does that even mean?”
“It means that - ah, hold on.”
Something unseen and unheard interrupted Oro’s thought. Mandri wondered what it could be. Oro closed his eyes. After a moment, he said in a hushed whisper, “There’s movement outside.”
From the way Oro’s head was cocked, Mandri supposed the movement was coming from where the snoring was earlier. Mandri held his breath and tried to listen in himself. He caught what he thought was the muffled of an argument. 
He made to crawl towards crack to get a better listen. Oro stopped him with a brusque, “Tsk!”
Mandri froze.
“There’s voices.”
“What do they say.”
Oro’ “Evidently our guard was supposed to be in here.” He smiled. “They suppose that we are both asleep.”
Mandri .
Oro saw the worry written in Mandri’s face. He said, “Should we humor them? Pretend to be asleep?”
“I’ll keep my eyes open, thank you very much.”
“Suit yourself,” Oro said. 
With that, Oro slumped up against the wall. Assumed the precise position he’d been in when Mandri saw him. So precisely the same, that Mandri began to wonder if the entire conversation he’d just had was only a dream. 
“And by the way, if it turns out that you’re wrong, and it’s not two demons stepping through that stone, then please, for me, soak your face in a bowl of beaten eggs.”
Then the sound of stone grinding against stone. Mandri looked to his left, hairs on his neck standing on end.
A short and stout Jandri man tumbled into the cave, and behind him came another who looked just like him, only a with a beard.
The first man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.
“The boy’s awake!” he shouted.
“Christ, Sob, I told you,” said the second.
“Don’t tell Ayram.”
“Oh, I’m telling Ayram.”
“Why? Nothing’s happened! Look! Look at him! Barely moved.”
The man with the torch glanced at Oro, who was feigning his fuge state.
“I won’t tell, but you’ve got to carry the Mazyd.”
“Fine by me. He hardly weighs more than a poke of tinder anyways.”

You pick up that Mazyd - make sure they mention that Oro is indeed a Mazyd. Moment where mandri is like, is that really a mazydai?

Swing around, torch almost brushing Mandri’s cheek.
“You! You don’t talk!”
“Wha-”	“No! No!”
The other man chimed in. Oro was slumped across his shoulders. “You’re among the Ayramun now,” he said. “You’ve got to earn the right to talk.”
“Nod or shake your head, that’s all you do. Nod or shake. You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Now boy, what the hell are you doing out here?”
Mandri 
“HA! He’s like a rat in a bucket.”
Leans in, eyes sizzling.
“Answer this, boy - what in the hell were you doing out here?”
Mandri did not know how to answer that by only moving his head. He didn’t know if he could answer it with words.



“What’d I say about flappin’ them lips? How’d you figure that meant you could spit piss in my general direction?” Bib tsked at Mandri’s insolence. “You break the rules you get what’s comin. That’s how it be in the Ayramun.”

The humorous story is told gravely; the teller does his best to conceal the fact that he even dimly suspects that there is anything funny about it; but the teller of the comic story tells you beforehand that it is one of the funniest things he has ever heard, then tells it with eager delight, and is the first person to laugh when he gets through. And sometimes, if he has had good success, he is so glad and happy that he will repeat the “nub” of it and glance around from face to face, collecting applause, and then repeat it again. It is a pathetic thing to see.
Very often, of course, the rambling and disjointed humorous story finishes with a nub, point, snapper, or whatever you like to call it. Then the listener must be alert, for in many cases the teller will divert attention from that nub by dropping it in a carefully casual and indifferent way, with the pretence that he does not know it is a nub.
Artemus Ward used that trick a good deal; then when the belated audience presently caught the joke he would look up with innocent surprise, as if wondering what they had found to laugh at. Dan Setchell used it before him, Nye and Riley and others use it to-day.
But the teller of the comic story does not slur the nub; he shouts it at you—every time. And when he prints it, in England, France, Germany, and Italy, he italicizes it, puts some whooping exclamation-points after it, and sometimes explains it in a parenthesis. All of which is very depressing, and makes one want to renounce joking and lead a better life.
Let me set down an instance of the comic method, using an anecdote which has been popular all over the world for twelve or fifteen hundred years. The teller tells it in this way:


But it was Father Peter, the other priest, that we all loved best and were sorriest for. Some people charged him with talking around in conversation that God was all goodness and would find a way to save all his poor human children. It was a horrible thing to say, but there was never any absolute proof that Father Peter said it; and it was out of character for him to say it, too, for he was always good and gentle and truthful. He wasn't charged with saying it in the pulpit, where all the congregation could hear and testify, but only outside, in talk; and it is easy for enemies to manufacture that. Father Peter had an enemy and a very powerful one, the astrologer who lived in a tumbled old tower up the valley, and put in his nights studying the stars. Every one knew he could foretell wars and famines, though that was not so hard, for there was always a war, and generally a famine somewhere. But he could also read any man's life through the stars in a big book he had, and find lost property, and every one in the village except Father Peter stood in awe of him. Even Father Adolf, who had defied the Devil, had a wholesome respect for the astrologer when he came through our village wearing his tall, pointed hat and his long, flowing robe with stars on it, carrying his big book, and a staff which was known to have magic power. The bishop himself sometimes listened to the astrologer, it was said, for, besides studying the stars and prophesying, the astrologer made a great show of piety, which would impress the bishop, of course.


Those had been hard years for the old priest and Marget. They had been favorites, but of course that changed when they came under the shadow of the bishop's frown 

He had seen many ghosts in his time, and witches and enchanters, and once he was lost in a fierce storm at midnight in the mountains, and by the glare of the lightning had seen the Wild Huntsman rage on the blast with his specter dogs chasing after him through the driving cloud-rack. Also he had seen an incubus once, and several times he had seen the great bat that sucks the blood from the necks of people while they are asleep, fanning them softly with its wings and so keeping them drowsy till they die. 


We others are still ignorant of sin; we are not able to commit it; we are without blemish, and shall abide in that estate always. 

 a winning face and a pleasant voice, 


Why are programs still admitting? 
Because grad students are cheap labor. The more courses you can farm out to grad students, the fewer permanent faculty you need. 

It's just as bad as you've heard, if not worse. Take a quick look at this data. Ignore the rest of the thread though, what the guy is saying is nonsense. There's nothing we can do &quot;as a discipline&quot; to fix this. The jobs are going away and they're never coming back. It's an unstoppable cycle of &quot;no jobs &gt; fewer history majors &gt; declining history enrollment &gt; fewer history courses to teach &gt; less demand for faculty &gt; no jobs&quot;, which is only made worse by the overproduction of Ph.D.s. It's a dying profession and I strongly encourage you to do literally anything else with your life and career.

INject bit about Shade/Geej - They’re not particularly smart. And their lives are short. They’ve the minds of rabid children. Inculcated at birth with the hatred of Hrk’s enemies. 

Every budding theologian looks for things that separates their religion from this rest. This urge is ultimately a search for credibility. It feels like a proof to be able to say, 'every other religion in the world believes that, and we're the only one that believes this.' 
Solitants revel in this kind of reasoning. When they proselytize to unbelievers, they open with the fact that every single one of Jandri's religions begin with a story that explains the existence of suffering. 
The Supine Cult believes that there are just two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter.
The Havainu take on more personal responsibility, as they believe that suffering is a result of sins committed, whether it be one’s own sins or one’s ancestors.
The Shalkians believe that suffering is a symptom of Shalkhsahsar, which is a difficult concept to relate in so few words. It is often summarized as the inability to perceive the edgeless nature of reality.
There are a hundred more religions, with a hundred variations each, all scattered about the continent. All of them, every single one, offers not just a explanation for suffering, but, more importantly, a solution for it. 
Only the Solitants are unique. They don't offer a solution for suffering. They offer more of it. &quot;Suffering&quot;, a Solitant priest will say with comforting smile, &quot;is what this is all about!&quot;
In the rare event a Solitant priest happens upon an eager ear, they will go on to argue that the notion of ‘Life without suffering’ is a mere trick of language. It's a string of words that has semantic sense but no bearing on reality.
&quot;Life is suffering&quot;, they say. &quot;Try to suffer without suffering.&quot;
They laugh at the comic absurdity of it.
Then comes the version of this distilled for childlike audiences childlike distillate, like fruit juice from prunes.
They say that the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's marble. It is clean, abstract, inert. Then comes the sculptor's chisel; then comes pain. As the chisel carves away at the marble to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the human. There is no beauty inside a stone without a chisel, and there is no beauty inside our fleshy vessels without pain. It is our travails that define us.
Mandrameen hated Solitants. He hated suffering, so he hated Solitants. Solitiss was, in his eyes, the most toxic religion imaginable. At least the death cults that wandered the desert would do you a service and kill you before playing with your body. If a Solitant gets their hands on an adherent, well, Mandri had heard the stories. And besides, Mandri didn't find any of the their theology convincing. How it could be, for example, that a religion revolving around the concept of pain can have so few words for it? Solitants speak Common, their holy texts are written in Common, and in Common there's just the one word: pain.
If a person says, “I am in pain,” there’s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe? Did a loved one just die? Have their bowels been blocked for days, filling the innards up to bursting? Sure, the word ‘pain’ can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The word ‘anguish’ approaches something different, but that's not nearly enough. 
Some intrepid philologists go as far as to suggest that the language Solitants use actually stunts the growth of pain appreciation. They argue that a person can’t develop a sensitivity to the varieties of someone else's pain if there aren’t labels for them. A Solitant priest will argue that there is no real need to develop a robust lexicon of pain because the natural language of gesture is far, far superior. There’s no need for a fuzzy word when you can see it all written on the face clear as day.
Observe the eye and brow. Is there langour, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety, havoc? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye’s lid puffy, or hollow, wet or dry, dark or pale, sallow of brown, or white, or purple? And then there’s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up to the face. The lower back knots up, then the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight to reveal a gnash of teeth. It doesn’t take an eye trained in physiognomical presentation to see all this and understand it, for pain is a primal thing. A person can look at another in pain and know, without knowing, their inner world.
All that is required is to pay attention.
Mandri didn’t agree with any of that. He thought that there would always be a need for a word that nails down a particular feeling. There was no better use-case than the present, where the pain in his leg was so severe that he was unable to walk. If he had the right word then maybe he could communicate to Moto how terrible it was. He couldn’t rely on his own tortured expressions because Moto wasn’t looking at his face. He couldn’t look at it. Mandri was slung across his shoulders. Moto wanted to meet up with the rest of the Ayramun, so he had picked Mandri up and off they went.
The journey was torture. With each step that Moto took, the wound in Mandri’s thigh chafed against Moto’s arm, sending a fresh wave of pain out from that lizard-bite and into the hip. And it was not a short journey. Two hands had passed since they left the Bazul road and wandered straight out into the desert, chasing after the Ayramun’s tracks. At that point, Mandri could start to feel the venom working it’s way into his chest. He felt a tightness around his heart and lungs. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. There was a need, here, to let Moto know what was going on. A need for language. Mandri availed himself of all the usual figures of speech.
He tried, “Goddamnit that hurts!”, and “You fucking shit!”, and “Stop! For Sol’s sake, stop! It’s killing me!”
None of these did the trick. Moto kept trotting along, unconcerned, eyes firmly set towards some 
Since Common lacked the word to adequately describe the nature of Mandri’s pain, he was forced to make one up.
“EeeauuughhhGoddammotherOhhhshityousonofahurlingsow!”
It really rolls off the tongue, so long as one screams it. It was enough to get Moto’s attention.
“Oh, shut up,” Moto said. “You did this to yourself.”
“Oh, no you don’t!” Mandri shouted. “This is your goddamn fault! You shit! You-uueeauughhhhh!”
Moto bounced Mandri’s weight upon his shoulders, sending another shock of pain through Mandri’s hip. Mandri retaliated by slamming his fist into Moto’s back.
Moto laughed it off and said, “I did warn you about the venom.”
“Put me down!”
“As you wish!”
Moto leaned back and dropped Mandri from a height like a camel dropping dung; wherever it falls, it falls.
Unfortunately for Mandri, he landed hard on his wounded thigh. He let loose another curse, then he rolled around a little, clenching his teeth against the pain, trying to find some twist of hip and spine that could give him some relief. The most comfortable position, he found, was to lay all the way back and shift most of his weight to his right ass cheek. That took the pressure off the bundle of nerves that were exploding in his left leg. It was enough, at least, to reduce the raging fire down to a throbbing flame.
After a few more moments of hard wincing, Mandri recovered enough of his wits to realize that the reason Moto dropped him was because they’d arrived at their destination: a place that Moto called Minting Rock.
Mandri was astonished by the sight of Minting Rock. It was exactly what the name suggested: a big rock. And it wasn’t just any big rock, it was a single, uncrumbled, uncracked, rock, like if he picked up a palm-sized rock off the ground and then scaled that up to the size of Salavan’s mansion, that’s what it was. Rocks that big tend to look like old, slumping things that have been half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, it was a healthy, oblong rock. It wasn’t collapsing down into the sand, it balanced above it on its belly. So unnatural and precarious was its position, that Mandri felt like a strong, sand-blasting wind should be able to pick the whole up and send it tumbling along the desert floor. He felt like even he could move it, that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling.
The contrast of that massive bulbous rock being set in an empty desert landscape with no other rocky eminence in sight, well that contrast made it seem like Minting Rock had been deliberately placed there by the hand of Solraheen. That would make it a holy site. But it wasn’t a holy site, it was called Minting Rock, and from the name Mandri could guess its true purpose: it was a place for these bandit Ayramun to mint counterfeit coins away from the prying eyes of the Hrkan royalty.
Of course, the Ayramun didn’t mint the coins right out in the open. There was hole at the base of the rock that Mandri couldn’t quite see. He knew it was there because a few Ayramun were going in and out of it, squeezing one at a time through some obscured passage. Mandri supposed that most of the Ayramun were inside the rock, for nearby there was only Moto and two dour looking men just a few yards away.
Between Mandri and these men was a big pile of the Ayramun’s stuff. Almost everything the Ayramun had been hauling was dumped there; their canvas strapped bags, their rolled up tarps, even that giant iron pot. Those two men were poking around the pile, and as Moto approached he drew their attention.
One of them said, “There you are! We’ve been looking for you.”
“Really?” Moto replied. “Seems to me like you’ve been tickling dick.”
“What do you mean? We were told to go and look for you, and here we are, looking right at you.”
Moto shook his head and said, “Whatever. I need to get Elrahet. The boy here got himself chewed up by a drag-belly.”
All three men cast sidelong glances at Mandri. Mandri could feel the judgment in their grizzled faces. He thought he knew what they were thinking, they had that familiar air of men who think manliness is worth something. They looked at him and all the could see was soft hands, limp wrists, and weakness. Mandri looked at them, Moto especially, and all he could see was idiots.
The man who hadn’t yet spoke said, “We’ll take you to Elrahet, as we’ve been ordered to do.”
Moto grunted, then said, “Lead on.”
The two men turned to head towards Minting Rock, but Moto hesitated. A peculiar lump of black cloth set amongst the pile of cast off things drew his eye.
He pointed to it and asked, “You’re just gonna leave this one out here?”
Without turning around, one of the men answered.
“It ain’t going nowheres.”
“Whatever,” Moto said, and then he set off to join them, leaving Mandri alone with the rest of the discarded burdens.
Mandri watched them go with a little bit of hate in his eyes. He mumbled one last curse to chase after Moto’s inflated sense of self.
When Mandri felt that the men were out of earshot, he turned his attention to that lump of cloth that had given Moto pause. Mandri could only see a sliver of it from where he lay. It seemed like a regular old black-stained cloth. It’s weave was worn and its thinning threads were starting to separate, leaving gaps.
The strange thing about it was that it was loose. Everything else was folded, or tied up tight, or stuffed into as small a pocket as possible. These Ayramun were fastidious packers of provisions and gear, as any well-traveled sand-folk are, so a loose bit of cloth stood out like a sore thumb.
Since he couldn’t walk, Mandri crawled, and instead of crawling around the pile, he crawled up onto it because it looked comfortable. From this little perch he could see that the dark cloth in question was a robe, and it looked to be covering up something underneath, perhaps a long pillow, or a large sack of wine.
Mandri dragged himself closer still to get a better look, careful not to disrupt the tenuous peace he’d negotiated between himself and the wound in his thigh. As soon as the pain started to flare up he slowed his crawl to a labored creep. When he chanced upon an especially comfortable place in the pile to stop, he did. With his elbow was sunk into a bag of grain, and his hip resting gently on an ox-bladder stuffed with jerk peels, he took a good long look at the object of interest.
That’s when noticed the hand.
It was sticking out from under the robe. It was a pale hand, and its pinky finger was dislocated and bent out at an odd angle. It was undeniably Mazyd Obo’s hand, and it wasn’t moving or quivering in the slightest.
Mandri wondered if the rest of Obo was under that cloth. He suspected the answer was no, because the lump itself wasn’t big enough, nor protuberant enough, to match Mazyd Obo’s grotesque form.
Mandri felt around the in pile for something to poke it with. In the absence of a stick or pole or anything like it, his searching fingers settled on an empty waterskin. He picked that up, made sure that it was well and truly empty, and then with a snap of his wrist he threw it at the mysterious lump.
The waterskin hit it, then fell harmlessly to the sand.
Nothing happened.
Mandri dug around in the pile for something else to throw. He was so tickled by all the little trinkets his fingers were stumbling over, that he almost didn’t hear the dull, snapping crack of bone. 
It was the pale hand. Its pinky finger had popped itself back into its natural position.
Mandri asked the lump, “Obo, is that you?” 
It did not answer, and it did not move.
Mandri reached back down into the pile of things and pulled out a tight ball of twine.
He threw it at the lump.
Suddenly, the hand snapped to attention, and in one fluid motion, it snatched the twine out of the air and flung it right back at Mandri’s face.
It smacked him right in the middle of his forehead.
Mandri yelped and his spine stiffened up in fright. This sudden jerk of motion loosed the pain from his thigh and it shot up into his hip and lower back. That turned his startled yelp into an curling, anguished cry.
Through it all, Mandri kept his wide eyes fixed on that damnable hand. He watched, half in terror, half in curiosity as those pale fingers gathered up the robes and then pulled them up to expose what lay beneath.
It was, indeed, Mazyd Obo. 
Obo, charmless Obo. The Mazyd was laying there face-up, with a wide, mischievous smile.
Mandri frowned back.
Obo then pulled himself up into a sitting position, and that revealed why Mandri had thought he was a pillow - Obo was missing his legs. In their place were two bloody wrapped nubs. Obo was now just a torso, arms, and a pale, sallow head.
“You look like shit,” Obo said.
“What in Sol’s name happened to you?!”
“Oh these things?” Obo said as he wiggled his stumps. “That Ayram fellow decided that my legs were more trouble than they were worth, so he cut them off.”
Mandri’s jaw dropped.
“Don’t you worry,” Obo said. “I am no corpse yet.” Obo then planted his palms in the dirt and lifted himself up, then hand-shimmied closer to pile so that he could lay against it. Mandri couldn’t take his eyes from Obo’s missing legs. Thin strands of gooey blood were swinging from them. He found himself wondering if he’d have to lose his own leg.
Obo said, “I don’t suspect I’ll be a corpse any time soon. Actually, I’m much better off than you are. You, my friend, are rushing up on corpsehood quite quickly.”
Mandri said, “I know.”
“You do?”
“Yeah, I got bit by a drag-belly.”
“The venom has a very distinctive smell.”
Mandri was still looking at Obo’s stumps. All complete and utter confusion.
He said, “I can’t believe you’re not screaming in agony right now. Or passed out. I feel like passing out just looking at you.”
Obo nestled himself up against a , and said, “Nothing hurts if I don’t want it to. That’s a perk of being a Mazydai. Pain is optional.”
“That’s unfair.”
“You want me to feel this pain?” Obo asked, pointing to his bloody stumps.
“No, that’s not what I mean. It’s my own damn leg. I tell you what, this pain, it’s worse than anything I’ve ever felt.”
“I might be able to help with that.”
“You’ve got a nice, stiff corn beer hidden in your robes?”
“No, I’ve got something better. Show me your leg.”
Mandri did as told and started to undo the makeshift woolen bandage on his thigh, but Obo stopped him, saying, “Come down here first. I need to see it up close.”
Mandri paused to consider what it was that Obo might be planning to do to him. Despite Obo’s calmness and generally pleasant demeanor, there was no getting past the fact that Obo looked like a creature who wriggled around in caves. It was the paleness and odd bone structure, but mostly it was his big bright eyes set in a mush of smooth, hairless skin. It was the absence of eyebrows, those signposts to the soul, that made the creature hard to trust. But the pain in Mandri’s leg was stupid. Mandri couldn’t think of many things worse than something stupid that just won’t go away, so he huffed and puffed and rolled himself down to where Obo sat.
Then he unwrapped the bandage, hissing through clenched teeth as he did. The blood had started to clot and so pulling on the wool bandage felt like he was ripping off flesh.
Once it was undone, the open air stung at the wound, and Mandri dry-heaved at the sight.
The edges of the bite marks were festering black, and the chewed up bits of flesh were leaking a brownish pus. Surrounding the wound, under his skin, dark tendrils spread out along the arterial pathways in either direction, down towards his knee and up into his hip.
“Oh shit,” Mandri muttered.
“Relax,” Obo said. “Lift your shirt.”
“I’m not lifting my shirt!” Mandri exclaimed. “I don’t want to see this shit!”
“How does your chest feel?
Mandri looked into Obo’s eyes and they shared a knowing look.
“Ah shit. God. I’m screwed, aren’t I.”
“I can do something for the pain.”
“Please.”
Obo craned his neck and lifted his eyes to the heavens. Mandri thought he was about speak a prayer to Solraheen, for it was said that the Hrkan lords blessed the Mazydai with a special nearness to Sol . Instead, Obo hocked up a massive loogie and spit it onto Mandri’s wound.
“What the -”
“Relax. Relax. Give it a moment.”
Mandri gave it a moment, and sure enough, a icy calm needled its way into his leg.
“What is that? ”
“Don’t worry about it. Mind you, it’s not a cure. It’ll relieve the pain. For a while.”
“Well, thanks.”
“It’s the least I could do for a friend.”
“You know, normally, I’d say I’m not your friend, but I think I hate these god-damned Ayramun so much that I’ll make friends with you just to spite them.”
“That’s as good a reason as any.”
“Gods, I hate them.”
“Oh, they’re not so bad.”
“Not so bad!? Look what one of them did to me!” Mandri gestured at his leg. “I mean, Shis stain on a bum, look at what they did to you!”
Obo looked down at his stumps and chuckled.
“Oh, I don’t hold grudges,” he said. “Ayram was right to do what he did, in his eyes. To his credit, it does make a good deal of sense. And he took no pleasure in it. He is a measured fellow, very refreshing to see.”
“He took your legs.”
“What do you want me to do about it?”
“I’d expect you’d get angry. But I guess if you can’t feel pain, you can’t feel anger either.”
“Not if I don’t want to.”
“Isn’t this worth getting angry about? You won’t ever be able to walk again. Why wouldn’t you want to get angry?”
“It’s like pain, Mandri. Why don’t you want to feel pain?”
“Because it fucking hurts.”
“I don’t want to feel pain because it’s annoying. It floods my mind with signal and prevents me from focusing on more important things. Anger is no different. It is unnecessary.”
This response stumped Mandri. He couldn’t decide if Obo’s rambling was a bit of pseudo-profoundity or actual wisdom. In such moments of indecision, Mandri resorted to his default state: calling bullshit.
“That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” he said. “And I tell you what, I’ll be angry for the both of us, because that’s just cruelty, what they’ve done to you. What they’ve done to me.”
“I thought a lizard did that to you.”
“That lizard never would have bit me if that asshole Moto didn’t throw me into its pit.”
“I see.”
“The rest of these Ayramun, they’re no better than he is. Anyone who can stand that man company, I hate on principle.”
“Oh, I don’t think they’re that bad. They’re good people considering what counts as people in these parts. I know that’s a little ambiguous, but -”
“No, I get it.”
“You have to remember, Mandri, life out here is rough. I’ve seen people out here that stretch the very definition of a person. If you’d been caught up by a Kalemite, they’d already be wearing your sacrum on their foreheads.”
“What’s a sacrum?”
“It’s your butt-bone. Kalemites eat people.”
“Honestly, I would have preferred that.”
Mazyd Obo laughed. His laugh was clear and it resonant.
“Oh, come on,” Obo said. “It’s not so bad.”
“It is. This is torture. And I don’t just mean the leg… it’s like I’m only here because they want things from me. It’s not a, you know, it’s not a reciprocal relationship. I just don’t like that feeling, like, there’s all these ulterior motives. That’s something I can’t stand.”
“I get it.”
“A thing to know about me, now that we’re friends: I hate - and I use that word with all possible venom - I hate people who are only looking to get something out of me. And I’m specially attuned to that mindset. I can sense the scheming from a mile away, and these Ayramun are rank with it. When they talk to me, there’s always some ulterior motive. Except for that Sob guy. He’s not exactly all there, so he doesn’t really count.”
“I don’t know, Mandri, I think you’re being a little unfair. Out here in the Sand, you can’t expect much in the way of fraternization. It’s a challenge to survive, and so naturally these Ayramun will look at you and wonder how you can help solve their problems.”
“But that’s how people always are. Survival has nothing to do with it. It’s the same when you get into the city. People in Jeket aren’t living hand-to-mouth, but they’re still, you know, always trying to make things better for themselves. If someone thinks you can help them out, they’ll want be your friend, otherwise, maybe you’re good for a laugh but that kind of thing always fizzles out. The only friendships that stay strong are the ones where people are getting something from it.”
“I thought the point of friendship was to make life more enjoyable. No more, no less.”
“See, that’s what people think. Then, as soon as someone starts to suffer, the other person leaves. Suffering isn’t an enjoyable thing to deal with. Sure, they might offer a comforting word, but then they leave.”
“It seems simpler to say that the person in question wasn’t really a friend to begin with, than to deny the whole concept of friendship altogether.”
“You say that, but I’ve never actually seen a true friend. Someone who is actually willing to sacrifice something meaningful in a time of need. And I’m not just going on my own personal experiences here. I haven’t seen it. I hear stories, but I haven’t seen it.”
“I won’t challenge your own experiences with my own.”
“Good, you shouldn’t.”
“Only because I have none to share. We Mazydai were created to be tools. When people look at us, that’s what they see, a tool, a weapon. As such, I’ve never had a friend, much less a ‘true friend’ like you say. Yet even so, I am open to the possibility of them existing.”
“Well, they don’t. Not unless there’s some mutually beneficial arrangement. And it’s for that reason that I can assure you, our budding friendship here is doomed. It’s doomed because there’s nothing I can give to you, and you sure as shit can’t give anything to me.”
“I can give you advice. It is good advice.”
“Advice on what?”
“Staying alive.”
“Advice isn’t going to cure this wound, Obo.”
“Tell these Ayramun what they want to know. If they ask a question, answer it as honestly as you can. It’s clear to me that you harbor no real secrets, so it is time to play along.”
“As soon as I tell them what they want to know, they’ll just kill me. I’m no use to them.”
“Then you’ll have to make yourself useful. These folk, they aren’t in a position to refuse a helping hand, believe me. Take it from someone whose stated purpose for existing is to be useful. I know when there’s an opportunity.”
“I guess that’s good advice.”
“And that’s not all the advice I’ve to give.”
“Let’s hear it then.”
“Stay away from Purl.”
“Excuse me?”
“The girl. The one missing her hand. Her name is Purl. Stay away from her.”
“I didn’t have any intention of going near her.”
“You can’t lie to me Mandri. I say her name and I can hear your pulse quicken.”
Mandri is like wut.
“What are you talking about? I have no interest in her at all.”
Obo let the name hang in the air. Mandri stayed perfectly still, the model of composure. Now that he was aware of it, Mandri’s could feel his pulse quicken and his cheeks flush. Then Obo hit him with a knowing smile.
Mandri protested. “I haven’t put one thought towards that girl.”
“If you say so.”
“I do say so.”
“It’s no matter, then.”
“Of course it isn’t. Even if it was, I wouldn’t take advice from you on something like that. What kind of human would I be, taking advice from a sparkless Mazydai about love. I bet you can’t even feel love.”
“Not if I don’t want to.”
“Yeah, yeah. Not if you don’t want to. And that’s exactly my point.”
“Mandri, there’s a very good reason why I’m urging you to stay away from Purl. You see, Purl has got -”
For the first time, Mandri was actually curious abut what Obo was going to say next, but Obo didn’t finish his sentence because something off towards Minting Rock had caught his eye.
Mandri followed Obo’s gaze but saw nothing. Then Mazyd Obo lifted his finger to request silence. He followed it up by saying, “We will have to hold the discussion here... Things are about to happen.”	Then, without a word of clarification, Obo hand-shuffled himself back to the spot where he was laying before, and plopped himself right down. He then covered himself back up with his robe and fell flat on the sand, so that it looked like he’d never moved at all.
He gave Mandi one last whisper, muffled through his robe. “Pretend that we never spoke.”
Mandri chuckled at Obo’s odd behavior. He opened his mouth to ask what Obo meant by ‘things’, when he heard a curious birdsong spring out from Minting Rock.
An Ayramun man was standing on top of Minting Rock. This man had his fingers in his mouth and was whistling a bright-beak’s call.
A second later, and Ayramun began to tumble out of the belly of Minting Rock. One, three, seven of them. As soon as one stumbled out, there came another, and each one in turn took off running towards Mandrameen. As they approached, Mandri saw their faces, and each man and woman were dead-set with serious purpose.
They each ran right by him and picked up as much stuff as they could reasonably carry, then hauled it all back towards Minting Rock. Only one among them tarried, and that was Ayram himself. He stood right over Mandri and blocked the sun.
Mandri looked up at Ayram, and such was the man’s size that he actually felt humbled. Such a thing had never happened to Mandri before. No matter how big, or strong, or intelligent someone seemed, it could never erase the fact that they were only human, an impulsive, excitable, waffling human. Ayram, though, his dimensions exceeded the frame of reasonable expectation, so when Mandri, buried in his shadow, looked up, he saw the head, the arms, and the legs but his animal brain did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater, he was solid, a reference point for being, like a father in the eyes of a child.
Ayram noticed Mandri’s wound, and then, in a register that rumbled the earth, shouted, “MOTO! Get over here!”
Moto was one of the Ayramun who’d been scrambling around, trying to get all that stuff moved into Minting Rock. He was about halfway there, hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried meats when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and then jogged on over to see what the fuss was about.
Mandri was happy to see that Moto’s all-knowing smirk was absent. And there was a faint swipe-stain of blood from Mandri’s thigh on the shoulder of Moto’s formerly speckless garb. Mandri knew it wouldn’t wash out easily, and while it wasn’t justice, it did give Mandri a flutter of joy.
“Explain,” Ayram said to Moto as he pointed to Mandri’s leg.
“It’s what it looks like,” Moto said. “The boy got bit by drag-belly.”
“How?”
“He was trying to run away and he jumped into a lizard pit.”
“No I fucking didn’t!” Mandri shouted.
Mandri’s little outburst drew Ayram’s eye, and as Ayram Mandri found himself struck by a silly thought: this was the first time that Ayram had ever heard his voice. Ayram seemed to find it funny. He gave one amused grunt and that was enough to disarm Mandrameen completely.
Then Ayram set his imposing gaze back to Moto. He said,“Explain why this boy was running away from you.”
Moto shrugged his shoulders shook his head as if perplexed. He had to get his body involved in the lie. That’s the first rule one learns as a child - when faced with consequences, the whole body has got to get involved to sell the lie. But of course, all that gesticulating, it’s not really selling the lie, it’s letting everyone know that you’re going to cause a fuss if you get called out on the lie, and if people think that will be more trouble then the whole thing is worth, you might just get away with it. 
Moto said, “I honestly have no idea. I must have said something, but I don’t know what, and then Mandri here threw a fit and ran off. I think the boy has got a dirty Spark. It’s like he’s not got the will to live. You should have seen it, the lizard was chewing on his leg and he didn’t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.”
With each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen’s face scrunched up tighter and tighter. He made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know what he really thought of Moto. 
If Ayram noticed, he didn’t show it.
Ayram said to Moto, “You didn’t do what I told you to do.”
“How could I?” Moto griped. “Ask him yourself, he won’t say a thing!”
“We don’t have time for this.”
Ayram then bent down and examined Mazyd Obo’s robed lump. Ayram lifted the robe to reveal Obo’s face - he looked to be dead.
“Take this one,” Ayram commanded.
Moto bent down and grabbed Obo’s limp arm, and pulled the rest of Obo up. He made a little show of taking care not make Obo’s wounded stumps worse off. A courtesy he’d denied Mandri. Once Obo was comfortably tucked under Moto’s arm, Moto took off.
 Ayram turned to Mandri and said,“You’re handling the pain well.”
“It’s not that bad.”
“That’s hard to believe. I’ve been bitten by a drag belly and it had me doubled over.”
“Must be a different kind of drag belly.”
“Must be.”
Mandri felt Ayram was trying to get the measure of him. Never more transparant had a man tried to get the measure of him.
Ayram asked, “Can you walk?”
Mandri said, “No.”
Ayram stood up, walked over to the disappearing pile of discarded things, grabbed the large iron pot by its rim, and lifted it up with ease. Then he brought it over, set it down next to Mandri, picked Mandri up by the scruff of his shirt, and then dropped him into the pot. The pot was so spacious that there was room enough in it for another whole Mandrameen.
Then, with nary a grunt of effort, Ayram carried that Mandri-stuffed pot all the way over to Minting Rock. When they came to entrance to cave, which turned out to be a narrow slit in the rock’s base, Ayram set the pot down and then kicked it, spilling Mandrameen into the dirt.
“It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills,” Ayram said. “I hear whispers that you’re a demon from Shis. Considering everything that has happened, I’m inclined to believe it.”
Mandri didn’t know what to say. Obo had suggested he tell the simple truth, but Mandri found himself cowering there in dirt before Ayram, and anything a cowering man says might be misconstrued as anxious deception. It wasn’t a question, anyways. He didn’t have to say anything. Best thing to do was just lay there and be quiet. 
Then his mind was pricked by that other thing Obo said: make yourself useful.
Mandri realized that it wasn’t a good look to not be able, in the most literal sense, to carry his own weight. So he decided, then, to get up and walk on his own. 
Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he set his hands on the rock itself to hauled himself up to a standing position.
“I think I can try to walk from here.”
Ayram was looking down him with a unquivered eye.
“So it’s into the hole, right?”
Ayram reached down and grabbed Mandri’s left arm. The width of Ayram’s hand matched the length of Mandri’s bicep, and his gigantic fingers encircled the arm a whole half over. With Mandri steadied, Ayram lead him into Minting Rock.
The entry hall of Minting Rock was a dark and narrow passage which, after a few steps, opened up into a short and fat tube. It was more than tall enough for Mandri, but Ayram had to duck. There was enough room to pass by the other Ayramun who were headed in the opposite direction, though when Ayram passed they gave him a respectful berth.
Mandri marveled at how much time and effort it must have taken to carve out this little tube, however, this was for just for starters, because at the end tube, there wasn’t a passage leading down into a natural cave like Mandri expected, there was a curling flight of steps leading up. This meant that Minting Rock itself was a building, a hollowed bulk of sandstone . Mandri felt himself tremble with excitement of even being in such a place. It was every little boy’s dream of desert hideout come true.
Mandri climbed the steps, climbed up into the meat of the rock, bumping some nameless Ayramun in the dark, and then he came into Minting Rock’s central chamber. 
into two revoultions of a sMandri was suprised to see that, all along the ceiling and wall were long bore shafts that let light and air into the hall. The point sources of light then bounced the hall, creating a soft red glow that diffused the chisel-prick texture of the sandstone’s surface. 
The only bad thing about it was the smell. Such a confined space, with so many unwashed bandit folk, the odor was dank.

Moto was trying to reason with the old witch Elrahet, who was trying to slap Mazyd Obo into consciousness.
“That won’t work,” Moto said.
“Wake him up then!”
“Purl!”
“What?” echoing 
“Get down here!”
A few shuffling feet and a moment later.
She wasn’t need. 

Ayram stepped over to 
“There’s a column of Hrkan riders headed this way.”
“Is there? I didn’t know.”
“You brought them here.”
“Come now, let’s not get tied down by chains of causation. I brought them here, yes, but you brought me here, so I could, as easily, blame you.”
“How did you do it.”
“I didn’t do it on purpose. You must believe me. Did you really think that the Hrkan lords would put so much money into making a thing like me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose?”
Moto interrupted. Dead seriousness.
“They can track you? How?”
“I wish I knew. If we Mazydai knew how we were being tracked, we would have devised countermeasures a long, long time ago.”
Ayram spoke up.
“It is no matter. You are going to open up that little mouth of yours and melt those fifty riders into glass.”
“Seventy-five. It’ll be seventy-five riders. That’s the garrison out of the tower at Scola, and they’d be sending out seventy-five.”
“Doesn’t matter the number.”
“It does, because I’m not going to help you.”
Tension. Look to Purl.
“The only reason I helped you all out of that bind earlier is because I thought you and I might come to some kind of deal.”
Moteah  
“What do you want.”
“I want you to -”
Ayram interrupts.
“There’ll be no deal.”
Silence echoed.
“Then everyone here will die.”

“You’re thirteen against seventy. You might be able to cut through some of those riders, but not all. And there will be a Shade amongst them. Big as you are, Ayram, I don’t think you can handle a Shade.”
Ayram grunts.
Puts fingers to lips and gave a piercing whistle, kicking a hornets nest, everyone filed out of .
For the second time in three days, the Ayramun were going to fight for their lives.

Earlier Ayram full on hatred at the mention of the Hrks.
Earlier - some sense of respect for Obo.


Potentially have “ive never been in a hasabah before!” knows about stone structures in the desert, thus might explain why the dudes have picks.

When Ayram is up close to Mandri, render him a little more - beard, individual details.

- ‘undo woolen makeshift bandage’ - make sure its right cloth material as assigned in previous chapter.

Idont think so.
You can not think about it all you want, you’d still be wrong.

Whose. Weirdest fucking word.

You have a want of gallantry.

First, its to stop eating what they give you.
What, you think me of all people should lose weight?
No, it’s not about that. The cook, Moteah, she puts saltpeter in everything she makes.
I don’t follow.
Saltpeter quells the urge. Dulls the libido. Gives you sad uglies.

Baltimore - one hot-headed fellow jumped on board the officers’ car and demanded to see their colors, cursing unionists and swearing vengeance. Lieutenant somers, stirred by righteous indignation, ststruck him a heavy blow in the face and knocked him headlong from the car. A crowd gathered, swords and pistols flashed in the gaslight, epithets were exchanged, and there the matter ended.

Yesterday our first lietenatn was drilling a squad of men. He was giving all his attention to ‘time’, and did not notice a fence had planted itself directly across our path. Suddenly he shouted: “who—who—who! Come this way you fellows in front—don’t you see you are running into that fence?”

It was nearly midnight. We had made a rapid march of several miles, and were tired, and hungry aswolves. Hardly had we stacked arms when lieutenant Rath inquired: “Where’s John Conley?” Johncould not be found; he was already off on an expidition of his own. “Well then,” Said Rath,” send me the next best thief; I want a chicken for my supper”.

Wwe had an inkling that a mass meeting was to be held on that eminence to discuss the pros and cons of secession and that we the seventeenthhad received a pressing invitation to be present.

Eli sears, the best, the most universally beloved of the regiment, is dead. He died the second day after the battle. A rifle ball, early in the engagement ,struck him in the left breast and passed entirely through him. When I saw him he was so low he could only speak in whispers. 

Our route lay over the elk ridge mountain, about six miles winding up its steep, rocky sides, the remaining half down the opposite side, the midday sun pouring his fierce rays against its rocky suface making the heat well-nigh unbearable. There was not even a whispering breeze to cool our throbbing brows. Two men of our brigade melted down and died, while hundreds fell out by the way and came straggling into camp next morning. The movement was foolishly conducted on the principle of a forced march when there was no call for haste. I was quite lame at the time, having cut a deep gash in my heel a few days before, which compelled me to walk on the toe of that foot.

It had rained or snowed almost continuously; we were out of reach of our supply train for seven days. Food gave out, but on we pressed. When we halted on the evening of our arrival, too utterly worn out to ptich a tent, I spread my blanket on the ground, threw myself upon it and slept the sleep of exhaustion. It rained during the night, and when I awoke I found myself lying in a pool of water that half covered me. My recollection of what occurred for several succesive days is very vague; I knew I was being cared for by sombody, somewhere; I had no cares, no anxious doubts or perplexing fears. If in pain, I had not sense to realize it. One morning after, I do not know how many days, I awoke to consciousness; I heard a wellremembered step tripping across the floor and stop ad my bedside, a soft, cool hand was pressed upon my brow; a sweet familiar voice whispered in my ear; you are better dear; you will get well now.”

We have lost our favorite commander, brigadier general poe.

We had a riffle of excitement yesterday in camp. Early in the morning the eighteenth and twenty-second Michigan regiments were ordered to leave for murfreesboro, tennesee. The officers of these regiments, in common with others, have employed negroes as servants. Kentucky is violently opposed to the president’s emancipation procloamation. Here was a fine opportunity for a kentucky general to show the abolitionists that his state was not included in that pronunciamento. As the eighteenth was about to board the cars, general manson, commander of this post, ordered htem too halt and deliver up all negroes in the regiment. Upon inquiry it was found that all, except one, were kentucky negroes, and were given up. This did not satisfy; he must have the free negro as well. The sixteenth kentucky infantry and the twelfth kentucky cavalry are doing post duty here. These general manson ordered to form in line of battle, and again demanded the surrender of the negro. But michigan was not to be intimidated. Colonel doolittle resoltely refused, formed his men for battle with loaded guns and fixed bayonets, and defiantly bade the kentuckian to ‘come and take him’. Not caring to attack with only two to one, general manson sent for the seventy-ninth new york to come and help him but the gallant colonel of that regiment replied; “I am not fighting michigan men.” In the meantime general burnside had been  telegraphed for orders. He replied: “I have nothing to do with it.” Colonel doolittle then telegraphed the war department, and is now awaiting orders. The eighteenth lay with their arms beside them all last night, apprehensive of an attack. They kept the negro.


At dubuque, too, the water is clear as crystal; from st louis down it is the color of chocolate. The banks of the river are uninhabited and uninhabitable most of the way. Every spring and fall they overflow from ten to thirty miles, and then this mighty mass of water will not be confined. The river channel is constantly changing. The light, loose soil of the valley cannot withstande the tremendous power of the resistless flods that are hurled from the north upon its yielding bosom. This is one cause of disaster. The sand bars change so often it is impoissbile to keep track of them.

This was a hard day for  the men and horses, owing to the scarcity of water and heat. A number of men died of sunstroke, and twenty-five horses were found dead. Not a man of the seventeenth has died, although several were compelled to fall out. As for myself, I marched near the head of the regiment all day, and was ready for a like excursion the next morning. 

I see by the papers there is much talk of the rebels carrying the war into the north. Well, let them go. “Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad.” I am not sure but it is the only thing that can unite the north; certainly it will hasten the downfall of the confederacy.

Where are those Union Leagues, who were going to ‘unite the loyal people of the North and subdue Copperheads?” where are those patriots who could not leave their business to go to the war, but would “take care of the Rebels at home?” But a little cool reflection banishes such thoughts. I have to act only for myself, and answer only to my own conscience.

We have steadily gained ground from the first. The series of reverses that attended our arms the first year of the war has forced our government to accept the inevitable, seemingly against its will. I do not forget the violent opposition to the emancipation and confiscation acts, passed by congress in december 1861, by northern men of undoubted loyalty, nor the president’s timid recommendations in his inaugural address to that congress. I remember well that reverses and disasters attended all our efforts until the government was compelled, as by an overrulling providence, to free the slaves of rebels, which includes them all; and that from the moment these measures became the fixed policy of the government, reverses ceased. It is not the issue of a battle or campaign that gives me hope, but the success that have attended our arms all through the month of July were attended by such peculiar circumstances as to force upon me the conviction, “There IS a destiny that shapes our ends, rough hew them as we will.”

I have seen a crowd of soldiers gther around an unsuspecting victim, a few shrewd, witty fellows attact his attention while others pass out to their accomplices melons, peaches, tomatoes and vegetables, and when the poor fellow discovers the “game” and gathers up his “ropes” to drive away, the harness fall to the ground in a dozen pieces, the unguided mule walks off amazed, the cart performs a somersault and the poor peddler picks himself up and gazes on the wreck in silent grief. At sight of his helpless  misery hte wrethces seemingly relent; with indignant tones they swear vengeance on the “man who did it”’ help him gather up his wares while he secures his mule. Thisis soon done, for his stock has grown small and beautifull less. He smothers his rage from prudential motives, throws the toggle on his mule and prepares to depart. Alas, the millennium has not yet come. His cart wheels, refusing to perform their accustomed revolutions, start off in opposite directions, while the air is rent by the screams and derisive yells of his tormentors. 

They were free to talk, and a more ignorant lot of semi-savages I never met. We could not convince them that vicksburg or port hudson were in our possession. They were very ‘frank,’ and indulged freely in epithets and pet names.

I will lie me down to rest.

The Gap is a slow, gradual ascent that rises to about half the altitutde of the mountain on eachth 18 side; its very crooked, and, at places, barely wide enough for a wagon to pass. At the summit it widens out into a small plain, or basin, containing about five acres, and shut in by a solid wall of rock two or three hundred feet in height. 

Sep. 25 1863
Thse are glorious days for the people of knoxville. They tell me the day of their deliverance has come at last. The story of their sufferings has been but feebly told. Even a brownlow cannot do it justice. Hundreds of citizens followed us to their homes, from which they had been driven a year or more ago. They are flocking in by fifties and by hundreds and are organizing for their own defense. We have given them the opportunity, and they are eager to embrace it. One lady told me it was with difficulty she could repress a shout of joy as she saw our blue coats filing down the streets. Loyalty here is pure and unalloyed, as proven by the sacrifices they have made.
We are objects of much curisity. An old gentleman a preacher, walked six miles to see us. We were th efirst northn men he ever saw. He said he could not express his gratitude to us for their timely deliverance.

Burnside - he owes something to the ninth army corps. Those stars upon his epaulets that shine so brightly, and which he wears so jauntily, were won for him by the ninth army corps. General burnside is truly a noble man.



Ball passed through both cheeks, nearly cutting off the tongue.

Our rations touch the starvation limit, and still the song and jest goes round. Not a murmur, not a word of complaint. We simply gird up our loins a little tighter. Our fare now is one-fourth pound per man of a mixture made up of coars black flour, bran and unbolted corn meal; beef in proportion; not half as much as a man would eat, even of that vile stuff, at one meal.

Parson Brownlow has returned to his home. He continues to breathe out threatenings and denunciations against his secession brethren. I have not seen him, but, judging by his writings, I do not like the man. There is too much savage ferocity in his writings for an enlightened christian. He is a man of great influence here,  and I thank god it is exerted on the side of the union.

— our hero’s regiment is moving out, but can’t bring all their wounded.
Dr. Bonine then called for ten volunteers; men whom he could trust; who would not desert him in the hour of trial. I was one of the ten. Everything being arranged, the train and its escort moved forward and left us to our fate. There was no sleep for us that night. Each nurse was assigned a tent filled with wounded men, who required constant care. We expected the rebels to appear early in the morning. I had but little preparation to make; nothing but to conceal the few greenbacks I possessed by sewing them under the lining of my clothing, and to destroy a few mementoes that I would not have fall into other hands. Among other things were a few old letters, crumpled and worn, but very precious to me. 
The morning of the eighth of may dawned bright and beautiful. Ten o’clock came, and with it the rebels. But, thank god, they are not gureillas, but a regiment of stewart’s cavalry, commanded by general chambers. They file around us. A major visits every tent, takes the name, regiment and description of every man—an officer follows and administers an oath by which we bind ourselves to not take up arms for, or assist or aid, the governmetn of the united states in its war with the confederacy untily duly exchanged, and we are paroled ‘prisoners of war’.
We were treated with the utmost courtesy by officers and men. In the afternoon of the same day we beheld with joy a train of ambulances coming in, under a flag of truce, to our relief. We reached fredericksburg about 10 o’clock that night. None but the wounded and their atttendants were paroled. About one hundred stragglers were marched off to enjoy the hospitatlites of a southern prison. We are awaiting transportation to parole camp at annapolis. How soon we go I cannot tell. I hope we may be exchanged soon. .it annoys me exceedingly to be a prisoner, even within our own lines.
10 days later
…what to do with us no one could decide. The general opinion among the officers was that our parole was worthless. I decided at once to report to my regiment, where I felt sure of getting advice. Accordingly eight of us started at 7 o’clock in the morning and reached division hospital—fourteen miles—at noon. Dr. Bevere was there, and expressed great pleasure at seeing us. I told him my situation and intention to rejoin my regiment. He requested me to remain while he made inquiries. A consultation was held by the surgeons, and not knowing what ot do with us, they concluded to send us to washington with a train of wounded about to start. While they were taking our names, general burnside appeared. The preplexing question was at once referred to him. His decision was prompt and inequivocal: “Their parole is good and must be respected. Send every man back to fredericksburg.” At 5 p.m. we were making our way, through rain and mud, back to the rear. The next day about twenty of us reported to the provost marshal for transportation to annapolis. Tranpsortaiotn was out of the qustion at present, but we were assigned to very comfortable quarters.
All went smoothly for us for a day or two, and we hardly knew that we were prsioners. Soon a change came over our keepers. The day before yesterday — may 16th— we were summoned to appear before the provost marshal. He told the men— I was absent at the time— that our parole was not legal; there was muc hduty to be done, and we must help to do it; that guns would be  furnished us, and we swould be rquired to do guard duty; that every man who refused would be placed under guard on short raitions, which meant hardtack and water.
Pg.172 - they refused. “I willnot take a gun, let the consequence be what they mau.”

I received a bundle of northern papers today. The tribune thinks the rebels and their northern allies will exert themselves to prolong the  war until after the next election. I fully agree with it, and think it better for the cause of freedom that they do so. Every day the war continues is another guaranty of the downfallof slavery. The time is not far distant when every northern man will become an abolitionist. Look a the Woods, the Brookses, the New York Herald, the New York World and all the leading pro-slavery men and journals of the north. Already tare they trying to disengage themselves from the fetid carcass of their dead ally. 

God bless my patient persevering boy. May he be kept from deception and craft, his lips from guile.




An honor system was set up where each side would take care of housing its own soldiers who had been designated as being on parole, meaning they would not fight in combat unless they were formally exchanged. The Confederates did not set up parole camps; they let their men go home and expected them to return to duty once officially exchanged. Parole camps were set up by the Union Army for its own soldiers who had been captured by the Confederacy, and then released on the condition that they would honor the terms and conditions of their parole.[2]
In 1862, a parole camp was established in Annapolis, Maryland, on the grounds of St. John's College,[3] But this camp soon ran out of space, so two more were soon built in the local area. One was located in nearby Parole, Maryland, which is how the town got its name.[3][4] The resulting influx of soldiers changed the nature of the town, since the soldiers were free to visit the local area as much as they might wish.[5] Many soldiers disliked the camp and described it as dirty in their letters home. There were some occasional problems with disorderly conduct by some of the soldiers who were sent there.[5]
There was a short-lived parole camp in West Chester, Pennsylvania, known as Camp Elder.[6] One paroled soldier, Warren H. Freeman, wrote to his father and said that the parolees in the camp were being guarded by inexperienced members of the Pennsylvania militia, all of whom were fairly lenient in their guard duties, presumably because they were guarding members of their own army





I see by the papers that secretary chase has resigned. Mr chase is a politician, and is ambitious; he has worked three years, with all his mighty intellect, for the presidency. In this he failed; he withdraws from the cabinet to further his own schemes. I may judge him harshly, but I can not forget fremont.

come the sixth Chief Justice of the United States, radical Republicans1 could not withhold their joy. &quot;Surely,&quot; one wrote, &quot;God has spared the life of the late Chief Justice until the fulness of time. His hand we now see. . .&quot;2 John Stevens of New York enthused that the ap- pointment was &quot;the greatest civil war victory won . . . during Mr. Lincoln's administration.&quot;3 &quot;The pulses of the nation beat a joyful accord and freedom's altar fires rekindle with illimitable blaze&quot; at the appointment, according to Alabama's very radical federal district judge.4 Others were not so pleased. Crusty old Gideon Welles, Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy, had growled that Chase as an appointee was inpossible,&quot;5 and Thomas Ewing of Ohio described the nominee as &quot;knavish, dishonest and corrupt.&quot;6 Within Lincoln's own office one of his secretaries thought that when Chase had left his post as Secretary of the Treasury, he had been &quot;relegated to private life, where he belonged, and where he should have remained.&quot; 7 That feelings ran to abnormal extremes at his appointment was only normal in Chase's life. Few were indifferent about Salmon P. Chase. Indeed, this man whom Lincoln now elevated had been in effect fired by the President as Secretary of the Treasury only the preceding June, after leading the Treasury through the bulk of the agonizing task of financing the greatest war-bill ever presented to that time. Chase had become an intolerable political burden to President Lincoln. Especially was this true in regard to certain treasury posts which the President needed for patronage purposes in the coming election. This was most touchy in the lucrative New York Custom House and Treasury Office, from which the friends of Secretary of State William H. Seward and New York Republican Leader, Thurlow Weed, were excluded. Lincoln needed New York support at the Republican National Convention. Chase refused to cooperate. In June, 1864, he needlessly gave Lincoln the opportunity the President wanted. After a compromise settlement satisfactory to Chase had been reached in a dispute over an important post in the New York Treasury Office, Chase petulantly appended another of his long series of resignations to a letter that at least temporarily closed the affair. Lincoln hastily accepted. Chase suddenly and most unexpectedly found himself out in the political arctic waste. To many Republican &quot;moderates,&quot; his removal was a Godsend. To Republican &quot;radicals,&quot; it was yet another stab in their backs by a perfidious President. 


Ironically, the deep antipathy which developed within the Radicals toward Lincoln probably had no little to do with Chase's appointment as Chief Justice. Shortly after Chase's unexpected departure from the Treasury had seemingly struck at the radical faction, the President had vetoed the Wade-Davis Reconstruction Bill. . In attempting to steer a middle course between the radicals and moderates in the Republican Party, Lincoln had been increasingly at odds with Chase's radical friends. His generous amnesty proclamation of December 8, 1863 had probably stimulated the boomlet for Chase as an alternative Republican candidate for President. The Chase movement first gained substance at a meeting on December 9.8 The feeling against the President ran so deep that certain radicals proposed to run General John C. Fremont as a third candidate in 1864, hoping to force Lincoln oui of the race. This movement did not die until the early fall. One of the uses the President made of the empty Chief Justice's chair was to keep Chase and his friends &quot;honest&quot; about the election. In addition, before Taney at last expired,9 Lincoln had repeatedly assured leading supporters of Chase that when the  vacancy came, Chase would come to the Court.10 To have reneged on his promise would scarcely have pleased the radical Republicans, and could have made matters impossibly dv    ifficult for him in his second administration.

            <Text>



Twenty-five of Ayram’s band were in attendance. They were a motley crew of every race and color, and they congregated on the shadowed side of the pit across from where Mandri stood. This wasn’t a living space, and so there weren’t many furnishings - just a few logs and makeshift chairs to sit on, as well as a few crude tents set up on the sunny-side of the pit. There wasn’t anything that couldn’t be packed away at a moment's notice. 
Mandri spied a few others high up on the rim. They were supposed to be lookouts, but they were eager to be down with the others, eager to be part of the buzz of excitement that filled the pit. This excitement was contagious. It worked its way into Mandri when he, Oro, Moteah and Sandie made their way out into the sunlight. 
The rest of the Ayramun were mostly huddled together in little groups. None of them were drinking. Those that weren’t sleeping were whispering about things Mandri couldn’t hear, sometimes in languages he had never heard.
Like the rest of the Ayramun, Renny’s sun-leathered skin had gone red from years of lathering it with protective kell-oil, and his greasy hair was sunbleached like a Jandrian child’s. All the Ayramun were blended together by years of kell-oil and sun; pale Carcinians, dark Zozans, native Jandrians, at a glance the Ayramun could be mistaken for a blood tribe. If it weren’t for the more glaring physical deformities it would be hard to tell them apart. 
The shock of Sob’s face nearly knocked Mandri over, for Sob’s bony features were twisted around his head to the right, as if something had knocked his face that way as a child and it just kept growing in that direction. It was so askew that his right eye and his nose were almost even with his right ear. His left eye and mouth were more or less where they were supposed to be, so his whole face was stretched in two directions. He could look at two things at once. When Sob glared at Moteah, he other eye was glaring at Mandri, too. 
One of the many unfortunate things about Sob’s twisted face was that it gave him the sense of being two-faced, because even when he put on a genuine smile, the right half of his face didn’t seem to agree with it. Nonetheless, he made an effort, and Mandri was present enough to take it for what it was, even though it made the hairs on his arm stand on end. 

“Commander Oro! There you are! What might you doing down there?”

“Hello down there. We’ve got you caught in a bit a pickle.’
‘You know there’s a cave there that we can just run into.
‘You could, but helfis here is a crack shot. He’ll put an arrow through your eye before you could make it.
Doubt it.
Go on helfis, put an arrow through one of them.
Which one
Not the big one. No one who looks important. Just pick one one.
Arrow flies and stabs sob right in the eyesocket. (earlier convo with sob about luck).

They get pulled up. 

Blood bombs to blow up the entrance to the cave - been looking for an excuse to use these - dont want any possible shitters sneaking out and cuffing us. Blow it up. Takes a lizard, puts the blood bomb in it, throws it down into the pit - booooom. 

Shade: ‘Do you know how hard it is to be made for a single purpose, and not be allowed to fill it? Waiting all this time assuming you’ll never be able to shit? Going to enjoy this.”


Now - what to do with you. Ive got one more blood bomb.
- do it with him. Hes huge. Gonnna be enough to kill all of them. What do you think. 

Puts blood bomb in the chest of mazyd, he pulls up rock and somehow take the shade down with him.
Hugs the shade’s face with his belly. Bomb goes off. Mazyd’s torso ejects. Huge hole in the face of the shade. Toungue moving.


ON a trigger, ayram, Moto, and the rest manage to  slaughter their captors. Moto is especially adept at dispatching the dudes.
Pyetle is about to get stabbed - mazyd saves him by telling him to let him be.
When the dust settles, all captors are dead. Ayram walks over to the shade. Face is blown off. Flower of goo. Tongue is still there, moving. Note about the whole, ‘mazyd’s shadow cannot speak.’ Emitting a strange whining noise. Puts the shade out of his misery. Moves over to mazyd, who’se missing the lower half of his body. Black guts spilling out on the sand. Still alert, in a state of shock.
You’re one hardy son of a bitch.
Ayaram is like, guess youre worthless if they want you dead. Was gonna use you to trade. For prisoners.
On the contrary. The want me dead. Want being the key word here. They’re obviously willing to pay for it. 
No way you survive
Push all that stuff back in. Sow me up as best you can. And im sure ill pull through.

            <Title>Interrogation</Title>
            <Text>It should say something about the Hrkan world that there exists a thing more popular than Solraheen. In principle, nothing is greater than their god, yet there are more paintings, engravings, and sculptures depicting conquering heroes then there is iconography depicting Solraheen. The conquering hero is the genre of the age and ages past, and Hrkan lords have used it to insert themselves into every battle, real or imagined. In Mandri’s age, the age of the oil painting, these conquering heroes took on color and realness, images so real that it almost becomes impossible to dispute the facts presented on the canvas. The Hrkan Lord towers above the melee, slaughtering enemies underfoot as he marches at the head of an army ten-thousand strong. The gleam in his eye is as lively as a reflection.
In these works, scale is critical. Scale humbles the viewer. A battle must be stretched out on a canvas twelve feet wide and six feet tall at the very least. The amount of detail - the armies arrayed on the battle plain, the swarm of men, all those heads, faces, figures, and flags - there’s so much time spent on working out the complex composition, so much detail there to paint, that it takes a whole guild of artists working day and night to complete the piece before the Lord who commissions it loses interest. If he loses interest, the money dries up. And the fact that a Lord is even able to lose interest shows that these works don’t do what the form was meant to do. At best, they’re prestige pieces, only ever seen by the wealthy, but the image of the conquering hero, in its primordial form, is meant to be seen by someone else altogether - it’s meant to be seen by the poor and wretched masses who dare to not submit.
As such, the piece which defines the genre, the conquering hero which has, for ages, instilled awe and unstied fear in the outland tribesman, gotten him to take up the yoke which plows the furrow for true Lordship, is, and will always be, the colossal rock relief of Arnaggu. 
The relief of Arnaggu is carved into a massive quartz dome monadnock that towers above the Forni plain. The relief itself sits four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicts stretches across the shaven face of the dome, six-hundred feet wide. There is a hierarchy to the scene, at the bottom, there is a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen, limbs splayed out like flattened lizards, faces fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, an army which can only be described as a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is five times as large as any other. He stands at the apex of the piece, and his upper torso and head is the only part which is carved fully in the round, and so he seems to be stepping out of the rock, his furious gaze is locked on some , the target of a conquest.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen.
He was unimpressed.
Yes, he felt some prickling sense of awe, but that’s what scale does. Make something big enough, it could be as simple as a blocky column, and person standing next to it is bound to feel small. But Mandri had seen Hrkan Princes in the flesh. These not-yet-Lords weren’t much bigger than Mandri himself. Mandri was forced to paint their portraits, these progeny of the great Arnaggu, and he had to paint them five times the size of the real thing, and in so doing, he came to see them for what they were: just as dumb, unreasonable, and obnoxious as any other mammal squirted from the womb.
This was the lineage given special dispensation to rule?
By Solraheen?
Couldn’t be.
Arnaggu’s army might have been ferocious, and the brutality Mandri could believe, but when he looked on the face of Arnaggu he imagined what the real man must have been. No doubt he was small, perhaps frail, and perhaps he kept himself teetering on the edge of barf-drunkeness like many of his distant kin, and in his sober moments he’d be unable or unwilling to comprehend the simplest truth that might challenge his private world.
No human being, by God or Nature, was fit to rule over any other. And this Mandri truly believed, until, at last, he saw Ayram.
Mandri was sitting cross-legged in the Ayramun’s pit cave, taking in the sun, still recovering from being dead, when all the chattering Ayramun went suddenly silent. Some hidden signal had passed between the bandit troop, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, sun-beaten men and women turned their attention to the tunnel. There, out of the shadows, their leader emerged into the light.
Ayram was a giant of a man. Many men get called giants, they simply have to be a whisker bigger than the rest - Ayram was like Arnaggu himself stepping out from his rock relief, and like the relief of Arnaggu, Ayram’s stern, countenance seemed carved from stone. His beady eyes were tucked under thick, mothy brows, and his long, gaunt face was sunk into a round, loafy, cushion of a beard, called an Unky beard in the Old Jandri style, named from the warrior poet, who was himself named after a mountain.
Mandri’s arm-hair stood on end, and a weight seemed to press down on his chest. He had to put conscious effort into breathing. His armpits began to sweat. They sweat so profusely that he could feel cold droplets drip down his ribs. He tucked his arms in tight to squelch the tickle, and he wondered what was happening to him. It was as if he’d just swallowed a spicy burgeon. He couldn’t believe that this was all , Perhaps it could be a matter of scale. Ayram wasn’t five-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was taller than one-and-a-half Mandrameens. A true giant. And the way he moved, his long legs swaddled in black wool stained red with sand, swinging in a loping gait, it wasn’t the same as a normal human being. If it weren’t for the human head sprouting out of the mass of robes, Mandri would have thought Ayram was a beast.
Thus, for the first time ever, Mandri saw a leader of men and didn’t wonder how he’d coerced his followers into it. Ayram was a conquering hero in the the fashion of old, and true to the form, the man carried the body of a conquered wretch under his arm - a wretch none other than the pale and misshapen Mazyd Obo.
Set against Ayram’s bronzed skin and giant frame, Obo was so pale and so small that he looked like a wriggling fish. Ayram tossed Obo into the sand in the center of the pit, and all the Ayramun scattered about, forming a distant circle around their captive creature. They stared at Obo like a pack of trained dogs waiting for their master to divide the meal.
Then Ayram spoke. His voice was exactly what Mandri was expecting: deep and resonant, the sound stretching out like because it took so much longer to escape from his cavernous chest.
Ayram shouted, “Elrahet!”
The aged witch called Elrahet stood up, keeping her face downcast in deference. With her spine as bowed as it was, she barely came up to Ayram’s waist.
“Yes, my lord?” she croaked.
“Fetch Purl.”
“But, my lord...”
Ayram gave his witch a sidelong glance, and though the witch couldn’t see it, Mandri could knew that she felt it, and so Elrahet assented, then shuffled on into the tunnel from which Ayram had just come.
Next came silence. All eyes on Mazyd Obo, yet Obo seemed at ease. He looked from person to person, provoking their, . He chuckled at some private thought, and rubbed away the sand which had splashed onto his brow, threatening his eyes.
Then took one last look at the gathered throng and said, “Perhaps I should stand so you all can get a better look at what the lives of your friends has bought you.”
No one said a word at this provocation. There wasn’t even a grunt.
Mazyd Obo stood up. He presented himself, arms wide, for all the Ayramun to see.
He said, “Those people in the ravine, they were your friends, no? Your family, perhaps? The ones I disintegrated with Sunfire?”
Silence.
Mandri looked to Ayram, tried to divine what what stirring behind that shaded brow.
Obo turned to Ayram, and addressed him individually.
Obo said, “I am sometimes blind to the subtleties of human emotion. I would have thought that the friends of people whom I’ve killed wouldn’t be standing here like a bunch of weak-kneed lamb.”
Ayram puffs up next to mazyd. 
“You want to meet justice?”
“That is what you people do out here, is it not? Pull me apart, limb from limb?”
A white smile cracked out from under Ayram’s bushy beard, and he chuckled.
“You’re going to need your limbs,” he said.	“Am I?”
“You can’t kneel without knees.”
Ayram laughed at his own little quip. It was a hearty, inviting laugh, and the rest of the Ayramun laughed too, mirroring their Lord’s emotions like a gaggle of hens. 
Mazyd Obo remained unfazed. If he was perturbed, it was because as if it were Ayram who didn’t appreciate the full of the situation. 
He said, voice springing sharply, “You want me to kneel before you? That is why you threw away the lives of your people? I counted fifty-two. Fifty-two lives for my obeisance?”
“Fifty-five lives,” Ayram corrected. “And we both know that’s not that many - not to a creature like you. I’ve seen you Mazydai slaughter thousands.” Ayram crossed his arms. His easy smile disappeared, and he fixed Mazyd Obo in his gaze like . Said he, “I know what you are. We, know what you are. You Mazydai are Sparkless. Hollow. Puppets. Things. You may talk like a man, but I’d sooner be offended by the sound of a pebble scratching sand.”
“All the same,” Obo said, “I will not kneel.”
It was Elrahet who responded in turn. Her gravelly voice came echoing out of the tunnel from behind Ayram.
“You’ll kneel before our Lord, creature, and you’ll be glad to do it, too!”
Mandri’s eyes darted to the tunnel. There, the old Elrahet came shuffling out into sun, and leaning into her shoulder was a Jandri girl, same age as Mandri, but significantly worse off. She wrapped in rags, and a mottled canvas cloak hid most of her from view. 
The witch led her along, slow and deliberate, because the girl was clearly drugged - or drunk. To Mandri’s eyes she seemed drunk because she walked with that familiar shuffling gait that’s spotted with awkward half-steps to avert falls that wouldn’t have come otherwise. Purl would have fallen twice over if Elrahet was not there to steady her. Old as Elrahet was, she was possessed of a wiry strength.
As they moved a little closer, into the full sunlight, it became clear that the girl was in a great deal of pain.
She tried not to show it. Her face, troubled by tousled hair and a lack of sleep, was set in a stony resolve, yet every step risked a full body grimace. By the grace of the drink or drugs she kept it out of her face, so instead the pain emptied out of her right arm which was digging into Elrahet’s formless mass with a grip that seemed it could throttle a horse.
Mandri searched Purl over for some sign of whatever grievous wound she was carrying but could find none. Whatever it was, it was hidden under the canvas cloak.
Ayram stepped over to the pair and pulled Elrahet away from the girl. Then he said the girl.
“It is time, Purl. Now is your moment.”
Purl’s face was pale, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by sun. Her eyes perked up when she noticed Mazyd Obo standing there before her. A dark scowl spread across her face like a storm rolling in. 
Ayram said, “Command the Mazyd to kneel.”
A girl who needed no prodding.
Purl straightened her back, with all the authority and snarl of a young Junkite Queen, said, “Kneel.”
Mazyd Obo did not move. Instead he looked from Purl, to Elrahet, to Ayram, and said, 	“I’m sorry, could you say that again? I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
“I said, kneel!
A tenseness in the air. Tenseness in the back.
“Come now,” Obo said. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
Purl casts aside her canvas cloak, straightened her back to  guttural shout.
“KNEEL!”
The shout echoed around the pit, and when into the tunnel behind.
The air between them , and Mandri was startled to see springlets of sand between them jump into the air. A force was pushing down on Obo’s shoulders but he resists it. 
But he resisted.
He stood up as straight as girl 
“Almost!” he said.
Purl wobbled, then collapsed to her knees.
“Oh, is that what you wanted me to do?” Obo asked.
Old Elrahet rushes to collect her amor. 
Ayram strolled over to Mazyd Obo. 
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked
Elrahet intrudes “My lord, Ayram. Purl has not yet recovered from the cut.”
Ayram turned round and looked down at the two women.
“She looks recovered to me.”
“My Lord, she will be able to command the creature. She requires time, that is all.”
Ayram ignored her, and turned again to face Mazyd Obo.
He repeated his question. “Why aren’t you kneeling.”
Mazyd stunned by stupidity.
“I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
“Don’t listen to this abomination!” Elrahet shouted. “Purl can control it. She just needs time. I said that she -”
Ayram smacks her.
Elrahet gathers purl up and carries her back into the shadows.
“It is not often that I find myself confused, creature, but if you are not bound to the girl’s will, if she can’t get you to kneel, then why haven’t filled this pit with sunfire and burned us to Shis?”
“While I am not bound to her will, I am bound by it.”
“There is no difference.”

“you may, let me retrace the steps that led us to present circumstances. Please correct me at any point if I am wrong. First, you people ambush my column with a view to capturing me alive. Ordinarily, capturing a Mazyd alive would mean certain death because I could, as you suggest, simply open my mouth and burn my captors alive. You meant to put off this fate by fiddling with my insides. You cut open my chest, removed my Minder’s grip from my heart, then replaced it with that poor girl’s dainty hand. Now, I don’t know how you could have acquired the knowledge necessary to perform such an operation and simultaneously not know what it is, precisely, that a Minder does, yet here you are, expecting the girl to be able to control my actions. Contrary to popular belief, that is not what a Minder does.”
Silence, Ayram studying him.
“Now is when you are supposed to ask, ‘What is a Minder supposed to be able to do?’. The answer is simple: a Minder can’t command me, they can only stop me.”
“You speak nonsense.”
“Hah!”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which, just do what the girl commands. Purl! Command the creature to stop standing.”
Stunned by the simplicity of it.
“Let me try a metaphor to illustrate the fact that there is an appreciable difference that isn’t merely semantic, but is mechanical in nature.”
“Speak plainly or I’ll stuff.”
Obo bringing his body into it.
“A Mazyd, such as myself, is like a dog on a leash. A dog has a master who holds the leash; a Mazyd has a Minder, who holds that leash. The skill, the strength of will of the Minder determines how much slack is on the leash. Minders are trained from birth to will my kind. Your girl, Purl, her will is weak. Her mind is weak. She can only stop.”
Purl draws a dagger and rushes Mazyd Obo.
“Kneel.”
“A blade? A threat of violence? Is this what passes for persuasion amongst you Ayramun? It might make puppies of this lot, Ayram, but I am a different breed.”
Purl pushes the sword up to his neck. 
Tenseness as ayram expects mazyd to move, but he doesn’t.
Pushes the tip in. Mazyd still doesn’t move.
“I think you’ve mistaken me, girl, for a creature who feels pain.”
“You may not feel pain, but I’ll feel pleasure.”
Sticks it in.

“I am of half a mind to let her finish the job. If she can’t control you, then I have no use for you.”
“This may be a revolutionary idea in this part of the world, but there is such a thing as peaceful coercion. You have something I want, and I, clearly, have something you want.”
Ayram pulls the sword out of his neck.
“A little give and take, is it?”
A few chuckles in the crowd.
“It may feel like a betrayal to give me anything under the circumstances, but as you say, I am merely a puppet. A hollow vessel. A thing. It’s the Hrkan Lords you despise, not me. I am a tool, .”
“You want freedom.”
“I do, but I know that wouldn’t be an honest trade. If it is only a knee you desire, then I will take something small in return. A token gift to demonstrate that a state of goodwill can exist between us. Give me a mouthful of water and I will kneel to. Kneeling isn’t beneath me. I will grovel, if you like.”
Ayram steps over to corner of cave. Grabs a sack of water. Brings it over.
“I didn’t know you creatures needed water.”
“We don’t. This is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of your willingness to cooperate.”
“You first, then,” Ayram said. “Give us a gesture of goodwill. To demonstrate the principle.”
Mazyd gets on his knees.
Ayram holds the skin up, gestures with his elbow for Mazyd Obo to open his mouth. Opens his mouth.
Ayram pours the water into the earth.
Ayramun laugh.
“Evil shall find no succor in my land.”
“Your land?”
“Are you so that you think the reach of your Hrkan Lords extends out here?”

“I’m starting to think that you people don’t know what you’ve gotten yourselves into.”
“I’ve been killing Hrks since I was a child. And here I’ve caught one of the mighty Mazydai. You can’t threaten me.”
“Curious. I wonder, how do you plan to deal with my Shadow?”
“Your shadow?”
“Yes. If you’ve caught a Mazyd, you surely have some plan in place to deal with a Mazyd’s Shadow - a Mazydariga.”
“Do you think the Hrkan Lords would create a thing like me, imbue me with intelligence, fill me with the most destructive magic in existence, without first having devised a way of putting me down should I ever escape the leash?”
“This Shadow, this Riga, can hunt you down?”
“It can. It is drawn to me like a fly is drawn to flame.”
“Oh, it’s not coming to rescue me. It is coming to erase any trace of my existence, and given that you, Ayram, are wrapped up in that, that includes you. That includes all of you.”
“I have been tangling with Hrkan soldiers nigh on thirty years. We Ayramun can handle ourselves.”
“You number twenty-something. A Mazydariga heads a column a hundred strong.”
“Moto, how many Hrks have you killed?”
“Over two-hundred.”
“All at once?”
“Know how many I’ve killed, creature?”
“I’m sure it’s beyond counting.”
“It is.”
“The Riga alone will end you all.” Theyre dumb, they don’t live very long. 

Tell me the difference between a cut and a slice.
A cut is shallow, a slice is deep.
Wrong! A cut has three lettters, slice has five.

Ayram makes a show of looking for the shade.
“My Shade is not in this pit. it is three miles to north, marching at the head of a hundred men.”
“The Hrks don’t have a clue where we are.”

“Better get on the move.”

Earlier Ayram full on hatred at the mention of the Hrks.
Earlier - some sense of respect for Obo.

            <Text>The Empty Portion
(Empty Quarter)
Middle Quarter

I thought of Buzz ldrin’s depression, his alcoholism, the way his existence was at once magnified and belittled by the experience of walking on the moon.

Desert or desart in their reports -f rom Latin adjective desertus, past participle of dererere: to abandon.

Europeans had no real conception of the world’s dry deserts until they started going to them. Look at the paintings of St. Antony. It was not only that vegetation was a requisite compositional device, the sheer sparsity of the Egyptian desert was as beyond imagining as the moon. Scarcely any of these paintings are without trees, and many show the abbot sitting primly in a landscape as lush as the apenninines in spring. 

Felix Fabri - dominican friar: Firstly, this country is called the desert because it seems to be, so to speak, deserted by god, as though god had used it to improve or adorn the rest of the universe… Secondly, this country is called the lonesome place, because no one longs for that land… Thirdly, this country iscalled the solitary place, because it is unfrequented by men. It is solitary because none of the countries which lie round about it wish to have any connection with or likeness to that land.

He goes on to tell that the desert is the image of death, that nothing grows there, that it is waterless, salt, pathless, inhabited only by serpents, scorpions, dispades ( a kind of snake whose bite causes intolerable thirst), worms, dragons, fauns, and satyrs; a place of demonic temptation, where great merit isacquired, and where lthe laws and commandments were given.

W.J.McGee - 1906 “Desert Thirst as Disease” - doctor and geographer
Finding guy left in the desert for just four days with one  days ater:
Pable was stark naked; his formely full-muscled legs and arms were shrunken and scrawny; his ribs edged out like those of a starving horse; his habitually plethoric abdomen was drawn in almost aganst his vertebral column; his lips had disappeared as if amputated, leaving low edges of blackened tissue; his teeth and gums projected like those of a skinned animal, but the flesh was black and dry as a hank of jerky; his nose was withered and shrunken to half its length; his lostril lining showing black; his eyes were set in a winkless stare, with surrounding skin so contracted as to expose the conjunctiva, itself black as the gums; his face was dark as a degro, and his skin generally turned a ghastly purplish yet ashen grey, with great livid blotches and streaks; his lower legs and feet, with forearms and hands, were torn and scratched by contact with thorns and sharp rocks, yet even the freshest cuts were as so many scratches in dry leather, without trace of blood or serum; his joints and bones stood out like those of a wasted sickling, though the skin clung to them in a way suggesting shrunken rawhide used in repairing a broken wheel. 

^Desert gothic. It is as if he has been possessed by the spirit of the desert or rendered into some calculus of all its extremes. The impression above all is of an organic being reduced to the mineral - this is what the desert does, before it scatters you. He is half-deaf, half-blind;  and there’s one last foul detail: “his tounge shrunken to a mere bunch of black integument.”
McGee douses him with water, “the skin first shedding then absorbing it greedily as a dry sponge.” From shrunken rawhide to sponge. Valencia’s revival from living mummy is in fact remarkably quick: within an hour he is drinking, within two he cna manage a little “ bird fricassee with rice and shredded bacon.” All it takes is water.
Having set out on foot, he became disoriented and exhausted. His canteen was soon empty. “He found some relief - after the fashion of all Mexicans and most Americans in like cases - by occasionally filling his mouth and gargling his throat with urine.
Two days after leaving the camp, he lay down in an arroyo and discarded his shoes and trousers. This shedding of clothes is common among those dying in the desert - instinctive but lethal, since clothing is all that shields you from the sun. The following day he chewed some paloverde twigs and ate som spiders. He became convinced that Rios had deliberately abandoned him (perhaps he did). It was this conviction that “spurred him on with the aim of knifing his deceiver.”
He found a familiar trail that would return him to camp, but soon fell under the heat and lay all day long in an arroyo. That eveneing, as he made his way along, he glimpsed a coyote following him at a distance. By no the urine he had been carrying in the canteen as mucho malo, “very bad.”
Five days after Valencia’s last taste of water, the buzzards which had been monitoring him for two days came almost within hand-reach. The next day his urine having ceased to flow, he felt his last recourse gone. The following evening McGee was woken by those distant bellowings, the dead man was alive, or rather he was not wholly dead.
McGee isolates five stages of thirst:
“Normal dryness”, “functional derangement, “The cottonmouth phase,” “The phase of the shrivlled toungue, “THe stage of structural degeneration,” “Death”.
Modern medics: mild (dry mouth, rapid breathing), moderate (reduced skin-turgor, sunken eyes and irritability), extreme (cold extremities, no blood pressure)

Bertram Thomas:
The paper was now so dog-eared and friable that it required painstaking unfolding in order to avoid new tears. Discredited or misdrawn features had been scrawled out in pencil, and new ones added. 
“High, red dune country; elevated, less-rugged, red sands, with horseshoe hills; parallel white ridges with intervening red valleys; flat or gently undulating white sands with transfers red hills; steppe, salt plain, and red hills alternating.
“White sands, dune ridge, dunes and basin, salt plain, white plain

Amid it’s horrors, peace - peace magnified by those horrors.




The Immesurable world:

A depression the size of France, occupying a third of the Arabian Peninsula, the Empty Quarter is bounded to the north…. THis tremendous bowl of sand has been stirred, clockwise for perhaps two million years, by two great winds: the shamal that sweeps across the arabian gulf from Iraq, and the Kharif that brings the south-west monsoon to soak Dhofar. 


It seemed to me that the chief characteristic of night in the desert was ot darkness but this light that was not the sun’s.

The interior rwalls re thickly plastered, bumpy nd cracked. The floor is packed earth laid with two rugs heavily nibbled by mice. I

It is the saguaros giant candelabra forms that break the line of each hillside and provide landmarks. The tallest for kilometers stands beside the cabin. 
Rinon mountains, the Little Rincons before.

A blade of light drops from the distant peaks of the rincons, down the foothills and towards me across the alluvial plain, until slowly, like a lava flow, the threshold where light meets shadow approaches the cabin - and then: there! The warmth as teh sun’s rays touch the back of my head and my shadow is thrown down long before me.

The ridge separates two washes (dry, except after cloudbursts): one is broad and shallow, the other is deep and narrow and what they call an arroyo

I lift each of the bed’s feet and slip containers of water under them - tin mugs, a wooden saucer, a saucepan - to keep conenose kissing-bugs or scorpions from joining me. I position the two chairs beside the bed, one at the foot, one alongside my head, and stand lanterns on them.

The Desert Fathers, the third- and fourth century solitaires of Upper Egypt, and the first of them, St. Antony. 

St. Antony and St. Paul and a loaf of bread.
When St. Antony left his home, the young man retired alone to a hut in the desert - bit it wasn’t far, hardly the true desert at all, just a place outside the village walls. There he was besieged by the devil’s temptations: memories of his former comforts, his abandoned sister, the promise of money and glory, and above all the “spirit of fornication.” 

“In the bole of a dead tree.”

He traveled still further into the desert, deeper into the devil’s domain, like a military scout preceding an invasion. 
“By now he has become an iconic figure and must fend off acolytes as well as demons. He travels still deeper into the desert, until he reaches the place that would be his home for the rest of his life: the foothills of the south galala mountains. This story of a step-by-step progression into oblivion, from the lush Nile floodplain to the arid interior, became a model for others wishing to renounce society. According to St. Athanasius, “ cells filled with holy bands of men who said psalms, loved reading, fasted, prayed, rejoiced in the hope of things to come, laboured in almsgiving and preserved love and harmony, one with the other.” 

“Even among the women, the metaphor of sexual conquest was near-ubiquitous: time and again the feminised desert was unveiled, exposed, vanquished and finally penetrated. My bedding was dusty with dried binding-glue. 

For geographoers, deserts are simply places where the average annual rainfall is less than 250 millimeteres, and where precipitation, by rain or fog or dew, is exceeded by potential evapotranspiration (evaporation and the transpiration of plants). The aridity index four categories of drylands:  Hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid. 

The model desert journey is a progression from the sub-humid to the hyper-arid, from the Nile to the “Inner Mountain,” 

In the Vitae Patrum, the collected sayings and biographies of the Desert Fathers, published in the seventeenth century, we learn of the paneremos: at once the place of uttermost lifelessness, and teh locus where the desert’s identity was most purely asserted, and that point furthest from the periphery. Polar explorers have another term: the Pole of Maximum Inaccessibility. This it seemed was the ultimate objective of every desert traeller: the axis where the absolute coexists with the infinite. 

A depression the size of France, occupying a third of the Arabian Peninsula, the Empty Quarter is bounded to the north…. THis tremendous bowl of sand has been stirred, clockwise for perhaps two million years, by two great winds: the shamal that sweeps across the arabian gulf from Iraq, and the Kharif that brings the south-west monsoon to soak Dhofar. 

Rub’ Al-Khali - none have ever crossed the heart of it. It is a name of terror throught rbia. 

Two kinds of tribes: those who you have a blood feud with, and those who dont. Both want your camels and arms, the second want your life as well.

It hs become difficult to be a pioneer. THe world has been done. THere are only the adventurers now, this new breed of fanatic: rangy large-toothed guys seeking not knowledge or even territory but novelty, managed suffering, “Experience”, mterial, sponsorship - K2 by canoe, the Amazon by bike, the North Pole on stilts. 

A brief catlike rigidifying, then the recovery of sangfroid.

I could feel his breath on my eyeballs - breathing the same air.

We had left the peripheral gravel plains behind. Underfoot was a floor of cracked white clay dusted with red sand. Between us and the mountainous pink dunes that fomred the horizon were only two salt bushes, long dead. 

As Nigel spoke, the realisation was dawning on me that I would die if Hassan, our guide, did not return. Never before had I known so intensely my life’s dependence on another. It was as if I had been dosed with poison whose antidote he alone possessed. And where was Hassan?


Rolling scrolls of circulation (wind) are known as Hadley Cells.
Deserts in equator, but als, Along the western coasts of the continents, se winds cool the air, reducing its capacity to hold moisture and preventing the formation of clouds, contributing to the creation of ‘coastal’ deserts such as Chile’s Atacama and southern Africa’s Namib. This effect is amplified in the southern hemisphere by the influence of anti-clockwise ocean gyres, which carry cold water to the west coasts of the continents. Meanwhile, winds arriving from the east have surrendered any moisture to the parched land. Moreover, the sheer remoteness and size of many deserts - thos of australia and central asia - mean that vapour from the sea simply can’t reach them. So dryness is partly a factor of isolation. 

In Oman fertile land exists in two thin strips: the arable corridor of Batinah, which runs north-west from Muscat; and in the south the Dhofar coastal plain, where Salalah lies… When air confronts a ountain range, such s the jabl Qara, it cools as it climbs, forming rainclouds that sap its moisture. 

We entered the nejd, a rubbled karstland dissected by broad wadis that had not run for generations and scattered with cement-coloured bergs of limestone. Pink sand had been banked along the road’s eastern verge by last night’s winds.

The alluvial boulders strewing the hamadah became rocks; the rocks became smaller black nodules of basalt, laid down in rows upon the paler grit as if by a harrow. THe land had been progressively degraded, growing flatter and smoother as it became drier.

Hasan was from a mountain tribe. He had a neat black beard and a steady, strategising gaze of  the kind I associate with both artists and military men… He wore a white headcloth, and a white dishdasha, grease-fingered across its front. ON his feet were perished black rubber sandals. 

Dust devils shimmied in the middle distance. You blinked and they’d vanished. In the heat-haze the horizon lifted like a page in a draught. For eighty kilometeres just these gavel plains, more relentless in their aridity than even the Empty Qurter’s heart. At least in the Sands, for Bertram Thomas and his retinue, there had been occasional waterholes; here, for camel-days, there would be nothing, not so much as a frond of ailing saltbush, and no shelter for anything bigger than an invertebrate.

There had been a quiet sifting of the land as we’d dropped down from the mountains: solid to particulate, coarse to smooth, hard to soft; almost indiscernable.

A boulder warmed will expand; cooling it will contract. Repeated over a hundred thousand days and nights, the opposing pressures will begin to undo the rock’s integrity. Tiny fractures will appear and widen; in high-altitude deserts frost will enter these cracks and jemmy them apart; salt will seep into the rocks as a solution and in crystallising expand the cracks still further (a process known as salt-jacking). The boulder thus divides and subdivides, spalling and flaking and crumbling, and with the wind and water, the pieces will be dispersed. And so mountains become boulders, and boulders rocks, and rocks stons, then gravel, shingle, grit sand - ultimately, dust. 

Rising from the plains, the dunes were visible from twenty kilometers away. After the hours of ash-like grey and pale cracked clay, it was as if we were nearing a new reality, one that seemed as gorgeous and auspicious, from afar, as the world of dreams. Here was a place for a checkpoint, I thought, a true border. I sensed Hassan’s relief. 
From the desert’s edge, crescent dunes no bigger than whales encroached on to the plain like scouts sent ahead of a vast school clamouring to their rear. 

Religious ablution (ritual washing)

We entered the dunes and almost instantly it was impossible to tell in which direction lay the plains we had just come across. To one lost in a maze, teh outer passages are indistinguishable from the interior. I was reminded that one of the Arabic words for desert is a synonym of labyrinth. 
The dunes at the desert’s edge were beach-size, but kilometere by kilometee their stature grew. It was like nothing I had experienced save for being at sea. As if hassan were piloting a skiff over choppy straits, our path up and down the dunes assumed a rhythm: a pass identified; a roar of acceleration; then the momentary sensation of equivocation on the wind stropped cresst, before the sudden plumet. 
After an hour we found Mohammed’s Land Cruiser in the centre of a flat rink of gypsum. Soran the camel was couched nearby. 

Under the seat of his Land Cruiser he kept a ceremonial sword, which he would sometimes unsheathe and, with a glance to ensure you were watching, throw spearlike into a dune.

So loved was Mohammed by Soran that the mere sound of his vehicle approaching would send the camel into groans of exaltation. 

I clambered barefoot to teh summit of a tall dune nearby. It took twenty minutes. The sand under my soles was losing its warmth, as if life were abandoning it. Like a pond it was cool beneath the surface. From there, maybe thirty meteres up, the desert laid out before me was brinkless, its coulours shifting by the second as the sun went down; but its vastness was not of the sublime kind that induces unease. The scale wasn’t belittling, because one had no sense of one’s own size in proportion to it. 

Camels’ night vision, Mohammed told me, is exceptional. “If your camel looks slowly left to right, it is a fox. If your camel stops chewing and stares into the darkness, something is wrong.”
Soran was yellow, with a dark bushy hackle along his spine, smaller than the all-black brutes loitering alongside the road from Thumrait. He wore a smile of beatific forbearance, and was the object of lavish tenderness on the part of Hassan and Mohammed - tenderness born of respect, even love. They would no more shout at or beat him than they would the sagest of grandfathers. 

The main quality sought in a desert campsite, other than shade from the sun as it rises, is shelter from the wind. It’s thought that most of the dunes accumulated some million years ago, during the Late Quaternary period, when winds even stronger than today’s winnowed sand from both the wadis of the peninsula’s interior and the Arabian Gulf. The wind continues to be a potent presence: it shapes and reshapes the dunes, and , during the day, is as constant as the sun. The sun heats the morning sands, the warm air rises and must be replaced. Hence the wind ubiquitous in desert literature. 

Army sent to vanquish the lord of the desert wind. 
Bertram Thomas: story of a party of the Mahra tribe who pursued a band of camel raiders into a part of the desert unknown to them, only for a wind to rise and obliterate the tracks they had been following. “Six months later one of my own party of rashidis came upon the seven skeletons and the bones of their camels.”
THe desert is mobile and wind its engine. The wind shapes the dunes. To travel in the Empty Quarter is to see their forms - “species”, as they are known - in their infinite permutations. The desert is formed chiefly of the uruq variety (from the arabic ‘vein’ ), towering parallel ridges sometimes tens of kilometers long, and crescenet-shaped barchans(From “horn”), whose tips point in the direction of the prevailing wind. But few deserts, even the great ergs or “sand seas” of the Sahara, ar forme dof sand alone. In the southern marches you experience not a pure dune-land, an endless beach, but a rather a complex of arenas. THe sand is quartz; anything softer will be ground to dust and blown away. Each surface grain accumulates a rind of ferric oxide, and it is this that accounts for the arabian dune’s characterisitic redness. 
The dunes are spearated by Shuquq, interdune corridors - elongated plaines of brown gravel and white gypsum; while the dunes are barriers exahausting to man, camel, and vehicle alike, these flat plains are the desert’s highways. From their edges archaologist have recovered the bones of water buffalo, the shells of freshwater molluscs, and the teeth of hippopotami. For, some twenty five-thousand years ago, during a cold phase, these plains were lakes. 

IT was where the sand melded into a gypsum plain that two ravens came to inspect me, as I was walking alone the following morning, soon after dawn.


Sulphurous water - there is no water so tainted, that a thirsty camel will not drink it.

Better to be straddling a camel, miles from the nearest waterhole, than hemmed in by men made from beeswax and snuff

You might trvel to escape the self, but in the desert of all places, where there is little else, you are thrown back upon your mind and your body with intensified force. Quietness offers no liberation, after all: there had been midnights when I swear my libido - whatever it consists of - was audible (somewhere between a stiff door and a backed up drain). Nope, the body was there; the body was there more than ever, and with it all its claims.


A badu asked for the heart of another pure black speciment which he proposed to eat whole because of some virtue it possessed.

The desert was not only vast: there was intimacy in its involutions and granularity- the cool mouth of a tunnel dug by a mouse; the arc scribed by a windblown strand of vegetation; the campfires dome of light. 

“The sands,” wrote Thomas, “are a public diary… No bird may alight, no wild beast or insect pass but needs must leave its history.”

Guy drawing in th sand. Again and again, between animals, there was the woman. When she first appeared he laughed, as if she had come unbidden; we both laughed. But then, as the face emerged, he became quiet with concentration. THe point of the twig moving across teh sand was suddenly the desert’s centre. 

Hour after hour,” Thesiger wrote, “Day after day, we moved forward and nothing changed; the desert met the empty sky always the same distance ahead of us. Time and space were one.”

Stillness - but the desert is not still. As a shaping force, the wind has a quality that water lacks: the ability to flow uphill. From the pinnacle of a dune a skein of spindrift is spun into the sky; along a dune-brink, a hundred tiny cyclones shimmy in line; a sheet of sand scuds over a ridge like a spool of paper rushing through a press. 

The desert is refashioning itself. Nod off in an exposed place and you will wake to find you have been partnered by a buttress of sand, The smallest twig will accumulate a humb in its lee. It is how the mega dunes began. Subtly the desert is in motion. 

Father of European monasticism, John Cassian, who had lived for years in Wadi Natrun, described condition known as accidie, which, he said, “we ma describe as tedium or perturbation of heart. It is akin to dejection, and especially felt by solitaries, a persistent and objnoxious enemy of those who dwell in the desert.”

Tinnitus, deafness, reaction from noiselessness of the deasert

Without witnesses, how do you conduct yourself? In the secrecy of any imagination, to what extremes might the mind wander? I’d found I was drawn to the lawlessness of the desert; not only the way norms might be suspended but how, in the absence of regulation or judgement, the word good itself was loosed from meaning.

A characteristic of eucalyptus is that its bark peels off in long ribbons, and at yalata these ribbons hung from the limbs and swung back and forth under a slight breeze.

At first I mistook the low intermittent roar I kept hearing for jets, but I realised that it was only the noise the wind made in the dry boughs of the malee. Although it was not particularly loud, there was somehow a massive suppressed energy contined within it, like the enrgy of a rally waiting to be addressed.

This was also the liberty the desert permitted: the moral liberty available to us in drems, the liberty to perpetrate outrages.

The Anangu’s relationship with the land is a matter of religion. You do not, for example, clear a waterhole in order to maintain a watersupply, but because it is your obligation to the ancestors. Your lawful obligation. THere is no founding myth of alienation from nature no Fall, for the distinction doe not exist: there is no “nature” to be alienated from. The desert is a place neither of banishment nor of tonement. It is not  your proving ground. It is not your sanctuary. It is not St. Antony’s relm of demonic temptation; nor, above all, is it the “hideous blank” of the pioneers.
The desert monotheisms tip their heads skywards, seek divinity in the heavens. Anangu know that it is the land, the ground beneath the feet, where the creative spirit resides. 

With whom was a white man expected to sign a treaty? Could a wandering black be said to “own” a claypan or a mountain? Does the dingo own the plain he crosses in search of food? Does the kangaroo own the rockhole he pauses to drink from?

Now, to shoot a dog in front of an aboriginal person is a real big nono. Because tey treate those dogs like children. Literally like children. They sleep with the dogs, they use them for hunting, the use them to keep warm. I’ve seen a dead bitch with six pups there, and the old girls will walk straight over - the dog might have got run over - and the pups will be looking for the mother for milk. THe girls will walk straight over, grab the whole six pups, and they’ll go to the young women, and they might have a baby on the tit, they’ll give them two pups, and she’ll put a pup on the tit straightaway.

150 km of peak-and-trough sandhills. Occasionally camels could be spotted milling in mobs between trees. Ahead of us was the claypan, a two-km wide disc of red like an unglazed plate glowing in a kiln. Emu Field. 
In its clarity the air was to normal air as normal air is to water. It was as if I had been given back the vision of childhood. It is a characteristic of arid places, this clarity caused by the absence of vapour. Claypans are ephemeral lakes, basins into which surface water will drain when there is sufficient precipitation, carrying with it fine sediment. In arid environments, where evaporation exceeds precipitations, such basins are usually covered with water only briefly and shallowly for a few days each year. What chiefly characterises claypans - like theyr counterparts, playas - is their flatness, their furface being graded and swept afresh with each inundation of water. 
The floor of the pan, scarcely rising or falling so much as a centimetre in elevation across the entire five square kilometers of its expanse, was cracked into irregular polygons and scurfing like a eucalyptus, and each of its palm sized scales shoe with a fine and perfect salt glaze. It was like walking over the surface of an old oil painting. The gloss added to the illusion o fwetness; where it reflected thesky, the ground was blue. A last cruelyt to the dying trveler. The appearance tryly was of water, even from a fairly short distance, like the ghost of its last flooding. 
I followed a line of prints, camel prints made when the pan was wet, gouged deep andmessy, the pan-surface littered with the scuffed up clay. Despite their soggy appearance the prints and the clay alike were, of course, hard and unyielding as terracotta. 

The world was assuming the mauve tinge of night

A few weeks earlier a man’s body had been found in the northern territory alongside his bogged car with a note: he’d been collecting brush to put under his wheels for traction, and had been snakebit.

But emplymentwas not enough to tempt them to set foot here. It was not just that it had been made hazardous and a place of grief, or that they were haunted, it was more that to go there was akin to necrophilia. THe land was dead, and only the mad consort with corpses.

If the desert is a hiding place for human crimes it is also an abyss into which those who shame, disgust or threaten us may be swept.

Whereas for indigenous australians the desert is an infinite mosaic of symbols and storie, they hyper-arid deserts of china have figured as mere interstices, or collectively as a dread realm entered under duress or to reach the next oasis, even among those who populate the desert’s edge.

And no sooner had I established that one desert lay here and another there, or that this one abutted that, than I read or was told that, no, the black gobi ends here and teh gashun gobi is not there, but five hundred kilometers north.

            <Text>When humanity was young and most people were living in dens like lizards, the people who called themselves the Solgruin were building civilization. They built the first canals and the first sustenance fields; a grid of plots measuring 6 by 1, clean and even rectangles set just off the banks of the Solket river, mapped out by the first cadastral texts. They had the first plow oxen, the first harvests, and the first age of plenty, all followed by the first catastrophic drought, the first stretch of worn out land, and the first law of fallow. This was all long, long before rest of Old Jandri toddled to its feet, and it was a time that history would have forgot if not for the fact that when the Solgruin capital burned to the ground, the fires baked the scribal clay as hard as rocks and crumbling ruins kept them buried safe for centuries. One of the stories that survived was the story of the creation of the Goree Pass.
One day, Solgruin petitioners went to the temple of Solraheen, and outside the veil of His bedchamber, they sang their complaint to Him in structured verse - as it was proper etiquette to address the Creator with song, even if all you were doing was complaining about how the Goree mountains were too difficult to traverse. The Solgruin were set on the western side of the Goree, and eastern Jandri wasn’t far away by land, yet because of the Goree’s impenetrable physique, the only way to get there was by boat, a five day journey around the southern horn, and the ferrymen charged extortionate prices. The song ended by requesting, humbly, that Solraheen should part the mountains.
When Solraheen asked why they would want to go to eastern Jandri, the Solgruin said that they wanted to spread Your word to our kin. The truth was that they’d heard rumors of gold laying on the ground in eastern Jandri. Naturally, Solraheen saw through their pretensions and denied their request.
A few hundred years later, the Solgruin forgot that Solraheen refused their forebears, and they went to Him a second time to ask, humbly, if He might part the mountains. This generation was more honest in their request, as they made clear their desires were mundane; they wanted to walk their caravans into eastern Jandri, that they might trade with the budding cities of Jeket and Shagota.
Again, Solraheen denied them.
Time passed, the Solket river dwindled, the city’s temple began to fail, and again, a new generation rose up and went before Solraheen and asked if He might part the mountains.
This third time, Solraheen answered with action. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak one day north of the city, and there he stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Yet the Solgruin did not rejoice, for when Solraheen showed them what he’d done, He said to the them, “Look upon this scar which mars My creation and lament your insolence. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, it’s beauty gone. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
This story is taught in every Solitant school throughout the Hrkan world because its lesson is not obvious, and the process of discovering that lesson is meant to be a stepping stone to prepare students for some of the more unintuitive theologies, for if one operates solely on common sense and surface understandings, they’ll arrive at the wrong conclusion. It would seem that the story of the Goree Pass is one which highlights humanity’s self-centered hubris; Solraheen created the earth and all its beauty, and then humanity comes along, and in its presumptuous way, said to its Creator, “What you’ve made is great, but you know it really would be a lot better if we could just make a few changes.”
That’s how Mandrameen understood the story - it’s a warning to never put your own desires above Solraheen’s, else you might be cursed. 
But he was told that understanding was wrong.
Why?
Because his Solitant proctor said so.
The old man tried to explain that young Mandri was making a category error, that there is no difference between our desires and Solraheen’s, but Mandrameen wouldn’t have it. Even at the tender age of ten, he’d heard it all before.
“Our desires are Solraheen’s desires, for we are His tools, and a tool is an expression of purpose.”
“Humanity is His tool, one that He uses to shape creation.”
“As the desires of the wind shapes the dunes, and the desires of the water shapes the valleys, so too do the desires of humanity shape the rock and clay.”
Virtuous desires, corrupting desires… Humanity is reduced to an impersonal force, more in common with the wind and rain than the mind of Solraheen.
“We are the painting, not the painter. We are the subject, not the audience.”
And if we are not the intended audience, then it necessarily follows that there is no lesson for us in the story of the Goree pass, or in any story in particular. And if all we are is an animated drama with profound aesthetic appeal, then the Goree Pass is not an ‘ugly’ rent in the mountain range, it is an act in a play, one with a depth of meaning that transcends the capacity for human reason.
This is all a little bit much to lay on a gaggle of ten year olds. It begs the question, one which a precocious ten-year old might ask, “If stories aren’t meant for us, then why do we listen to and tell them?”
To this, Solitants smirk and say, “Very good, you’re on the right track,” and then they refuse to explicate, the only nod with a promising smile that suggests that the student is on the cusp of righteousness.
Mandrameen liked the story of the Goree Pass. There was something in it for him. It justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.
Mandri had spent a week and a small fortune on this painting, and he scrapped it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the King of the Huldolun, and the woman wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Puddles!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Puddles!”.
Now, Mandri could have tried find a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment, and as his fingers tore the canvas, a sense of justice motivated through his veins, and he tore it completely in half, right there in front of that woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came confused anger. Her voiced pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, he would have cursed that woman, just as Solraheen cursed those who journey the Goree Pass.
But even curses do little to dissuade people from defying their own desires. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.
According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.
Either there was no curse and the story was just a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin.
Moto gestured grandly to the bright morning sky and asked, “How could such a place be cursed?”
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To Mandri’s right was the open desert, and to his left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Namid from spreading out of control. 
Marching southward, came the first signs of Solraheen’s spite, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven as rocks popped up out of the sand like roots, and the further south they went, the Goree’s wall grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground, and these cracks had long been rubbed smooth by an eon of blasting sand, rounding the edges, pillowing the seams, giving the them the appearance of infected, pustuled scars. 
Mandri could see the Goree Pass in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Moto informed Mandri that that splinter was a tower, a central column in a fortification which spanned the length of the pass, protecting the entrance in ancient times from ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage with all the boulders scattered about. Scrambling over those which were mostly buried. Some were the size of Minting Rock.
“This is what rock vomit looks like,” said Seb. He was walking alongside Mandri and Obo, gums squelching on a Borcandi spine. “Solraheen punched the gut of the mountain, and the mountain spat these big rocks out. Can you believe it? Like kidney stones.”
Obo, bouncing along in his litter, “You have a peculiar talent for transforming the ineffable into the disgusting,” he said.
Mandri agreed that the scattered boulders were a disquieting sight, for the amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. Would have been unbelievable if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it.
Mandrameen imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant speck outshining the sun, his golden rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe for Him to set the fount of creation under the earth to bubbling, the mountains to quaking, and then the earth’s crust would burst open, and exploding out, miles up into the air, were stones the size of houses. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and spat out - vomited out - onto the desert plain. 
The boulders dwarfed Mandrameen, and he supposed he wasn’t the only one feeling small, for Seb’s back seemed stuck in an almost reverential bow. That bend could be attributed to the weight of Seb’s pack and the long journey bearing on him, but the man’s face was alight in anxious wonder as his eyes fretted about and his jaw chewed his borcandi spines so hard that his muscles were going stiff. And the man wasn’t paying attention to where he was spitting the juice. Halfway up and over a light scramble over a low shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel. This precipitated a conflict.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted himself up onto. The two shared a long, sizing look. “Don’t disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Oh? Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a man like that, it’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my leg!”
“It was an accident!”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to .”
This a standoff.


Mandri brushed past them, and then Purl. Purl said, “This is how it gets when a fight is coming.”
“We’re expecting to get into a fight?” Mandri asked.
Purl scoffed. “What do you think we’ve come all this way for?”
“Running from the Hrks,” Mandri said.
“We’re not running from them, we’re luring them into a trap.”
“Is that what we’re doing?” Obo asked, his sarcastic.
Purl huffed and said, “Once we meet up with the Greskalun, we’re going to trap the Hrks in the Goree Pass and capture their Riga, and once that’s done, you will no longer be a problem.”
Mandri asked, “That’s all happening today?”
Purl shrugged. “Probably,” she said.
“But we’ve just crawled out of the most forsaken place on earth.”
“That doesn’t matter,” Purl said. “If the Hrks are on us, it’ll be today.”
Mandri asked Obo. “What do you think, Obo? Are the Hrks right on our tail?”
Obo was quick to answer, like he’d been waiting for Mandri to ask. “I can’t be sure,” he said.
Purl grunted. “What would he know about it?”
“He doesn’t know about it, that’s why he said he can’t be sure.”
“He acts like he does know, that’s the thing.”
Obo quipped, “I don’t.”
Purl reluctantly set her eyes upon Obo. 
“Then stop acting like you do.”
“What’s he doing?” Mandri asked?
Purl’s lip curled in disgust. “He’s got that sickly smile plastered on his face,” she said.
“That’s just how he looks.”
Purl grunted as if she didn’t agree. She to fix Obo.
“These could be your final hours, creature.”
“They could be yours as well,” Obo countered.
“You’re not getting it. If the Hrks do show up today, then regardless of who wins, you’re as good as dead.”
Obo nestled into his pack. “If that’s true, then I suppose I shouldn’t be smiling.”
“It is true.”
“So you say.”
“See, that’s exactly it - you act like you know something I don’t… and maybe you do, but I know things you don’t know too, and if you were smart you’d take that into account before getting all smugly.”
“Purl, I don’t doubt that you have some unique experiences or information that I don’t, but what you don’t have - and this isn’t an insult, I’m simply being honest here - what you don’t have is insight. You don’t have understanding.”
“Uh-huh”.
“That’s nothing to be ashamed of. No one criticizes a rock for it’s capacity for reason. A rock is a rock and that’s fine. It’s the same for humans such as yourself and Mandrameen.”
“Oh, so we’re rocks compared to you?”
“Again, I’m not insulting you. Human beings in general. Oh, don’t act like you don’t agree. I’ve seen the way you look at people. Any time someone says something ridiculous, I see those eyes go dead - see that’s it! That’s exactly it, that furrowed brow.”
“Evidently your missing the way I’m looking at you.”
“My are simply confusing your reflexive impulses. Someone says something you don’t agree with, and you look at them like they’re stupid, only in my case, the fact that you don’t agree with me is your fault.”
“You’re just as dumb as anyone else, the only difference is that you don’t know it.”
“Nonsense. The difference between a Mazyd and a human is that humans cannot access the necessary equipment to efficiently traverse the landscape of all possible understanding. A Mazyd is not similarly deprived.”
“What does that even mean?”
“Humans, such as yourselves, have never climbed Mount Arausing in the badlands, and it’s not for a lack of trying, either. It is simply not something that can be done with hands and feet, or even climbing picks and rope. That inability to reach the peaks of Nugrush is a consequence of your design, because other creatures, designed differently, can reach it. Birds can reach it. Some species of lizards. This isn’t an indictment on humanity, it’s simply a matter of kind. It’s not an insult to point out the fact that you’ll never climb Nugrush, and so it’s not an insult to say you’ll never reach the peaks of understanding.” 
“Then why does it feel like you’re insulting us?”
“Because you’re coming to terms with your own inadequacies. I can’t imagine that feels good.”
“You’re wrong.”
“Purl, you do not have the tools necessary to know whether or not I’m wrong.”
“I don’t need a climbing pick to know you’re full of shit.”
Mandri chuckled at the . Obo groaned and said, “Pithy sentiments won’t change the truth of your own nature.
“Again, it’s not an insult. I am simply stating a fact. A fact is not insulting, it simply is.”
“A simple fact. Obo, that’s not how . There’s no such thing as ‘simple facts’. And in your case, and you, Obo, are a schemer.”
“Of course I’m a schemer. Everyone is a schemer.”
Mandri cocked his head proudly. “I’m not a schemer,” he said.
Obo’s dismissed Mandri’s statement with a , and said, “Anyone who wants to accomplish anything schemes.”
“Only kings, priests, and demons scheme.”
“Scheming, manipulation, these things aren’t bad, they’re inevitable. There’s only the matter of whether or not a person is honest about doing it, and I’m an honest schemer. I’ve made my goals abundantly clear.”
“You are not getting a Spark.”
“At the present moment, no, I’m not, but circumstances can change.”
“You’re not even going to be alive by the time night rolls in.”
“I won’t be?”
“You won’t be.”
“I think I will be.”
Purl tsk’d and said, “There’s that misguided certainty.”
Mandri said, “Well, hold on. Maybe Obo is right and the Hrks aren’t actually behind us. I feel like that’s something He could know. Remember how he knew the Hrks were coming when we were down in that pit cave?”
The silence that followed told Mandri that he’d made sense. Purl was . 
It was Obo who picked up the thread. “It’s not so much that the Hrks aren’t there,” he said. “It’s that the Greskalun aren’t there.”
“Explain.”
“We are seeking out the Greskalun, expecting to find them at the entrance of the Goree Pass, but we’re not going to find them there.”
“Why not?”
“Because they’re not there.”
“How could you possibly know that?”
“A preponderance of evidence.”
There’s a state between annoyance and disbelief, and Purl’s was steaming in it.
Obo said, “It would take too much time for me to recount my reasoning. We’ll upon the pass before long and you’ll see for yourself.”
Mandri thought he could hear Purl mulling Obo’s words her head, and that was without even being able to see her, like the cadence of her march was more contemplative.
Eventuality, Purl blurted out, “You’re so full of shit,” and Mandri had to catch himself from as she stomped past. 
He half-whispered to Obo, “Are you full of shit?”
Obo chuckled to himself, a __ chuckle, almost like a purr, as if he were a cat nestling down in a window-square of sunlight.
“Have I ever lied?” He asked.
“Yes,” said Mandri firmly.
“When?”
“I don’t know. But I’m sure you have. Don’t expect me to believe that you’ve never lied.”
“I have wronged, I have deceived, but in all my life, I have never lied.”
“Sure you haven’t.”
“I haven’t. Or should I lie to get you to trust my honest word?”
“Obo, please. In the same breath you admit that you’re deceitful and then you claim you’ve never lied. You can’t do that.”
“Why not? Strictly speaking, my words are true even if my intentions are dishonest.”
“There’s no difference between… there’s no difference between manipulating the truth and lying.”
“There is mountain of a difference! Lying leaves you no wiggle room if circumstances conspire against you. If you always tell the truth, no one can ever accuse you of misleading them because you can say, ‘When have I lied to you?’, and they’ll be left stumbling after bad eggs. So, for as long as other people matter, it is always best to tell the truth.”
“I’m confused, are you trying to get me to trust you more, or less?”
“At this point I’m just speaking openly.”
“Why?”
“We’re friends Mandri, this is what friends do. They talk about what interests them so that they can fully-realize another person in their mind, that they might be lassoed and brought nearer together.”
“I already know who you are, Obo. You might have all these Ayramun fooled, but I know who you are.”
“So dramatic.”
“I see how you smile whenever someone calls you ‘creature’, like you’re proud of it. You think you’re something different, better than us, but you’re no different at all.”
“I can shoot sunfire out of my mouth.”
“You’re different in some ways, sure, but in all the ways that matter you’re as much a human being as anyone else. More human, even. The perfect human. Humanity distillate. I bet that’s what the Mazyd guild were doing when they made you, they bundled up a ball of people and just squeezed you out of them.”
“Actually, that’s not too far off from the truth.”
Mandri hiccuped.
“Only talk about about the squeezing, though. In mind and temperament, believe me when I say that I am nothing at all like you or any other person you’ve ever met.”
“But you are! Listen to yourself…”
“A sword is not the same as the iron ore from which it is drawn.”
“If you’re made of human, if you act human, you are human. You can’t wriggle out of this with some bullshit metaphor. It’s high time you feel wounded by the truth.”
“I can’t be wounded by an arrow that misses.”
“Ha! I missed? I haven’t missed, in fact, your assumption that I’ve missed proves my point… The dumb certainty in spite of your ignorance… that is so quintessentially human.”
“Mandri, if you think that’s the essence of humanity is idiocy, then you’ve been severely overestimating your kind.”
“Ha!”
“You’re forgetting that there’s one urge which underpins almost all human behavior, and that’s an urge which I lack completely. I don’t even need to suppress it, like I can suppress pain, because it’s simply not there.”
“And what urge is that?”
“How should I put this delicately…”
“Are you talking about sex?”
“Yes, the marital urge... If it’s not infecting every little decision you make, then it’s hanging like a specter over your life’s ambitions. I suffer from no such affliction.”
“Lucky you.”
“And to be sure - that’s only the footstool of the differences between you and I. The crown is beyond ”
“Uh-huh.”
“Don’t ‘Uh-huh’ me.”
“Okay then, what’s the crowning difference.”
“You lack the conceptual framework to understanding it. Perhaps if you were schooled in the logics we could approach it.”
“Uh-huh.”
Obo sighs.
“For you, the intellect is nothing but a weapon which you use to fend off challenges to your sense of self. For me, it is something else altogether. Look at Purl up ahead. If you can look past her pelvic girdle and , Right now she’s scrambling to make sense of the prospect that the greskalun aren’t actually here, that I might be all bad. Her entire mind is engaged in the act of defending her sense of the world and her own place in it, when instead, she could have accepted the truth of the situation and moved on to dealing with it.
“I still don’t see how you could know that the Greskalun aren’t there.”
“”
“Let’s make a bet. If the Greskalun are in the pass, then 
“And if they aren’t?”
“I’ll continue to carry you around.”
“That’s not a fair bet.”

There was this feeling, not quite captured in any painting of the subject, that the Goree was not a mountain but a corpse of stone lying there on the desert, rotted through. The further south they walked, the clearer this became as the main body of the mountain, at first a smooth, sheer face, progressively crumbled into a heap. More and more loose stone was piled up at it’s base, and these shards, many scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass, were as friable as the brittlest shale. They crunched underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased; when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against a boulder, his palm punched a dent in it, as if it were a. 
There was, undoubtedly, a curse on this land, and Mandri and the Ayramun were fast approaching its source: the pass itself. Though the depths of the pass were hidden by the sharp angle from which Mandri viewed it, its presence marked by a black tower which poked out from it like a splinter stuck in a wound.
If that tower had a truer name than ‘The Western Tower’, Mandri did not catch it among the nervous whispers of the Ayramun. A had settled in among them, and Mandri as well. He wasn’t worried as much about the Greskalun, he just didn’t like towers. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but it’d still have an air of evil because there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy; nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. Everything else was cover for evil intentions, or otherwise monuments to human hubris, and this Tower, black and foreboding as it was, was a particularly striking example of the latter.
There are certain schools of landscape painters which get paid handsomely to advertise certain places of the world, holy places mostly, holy places near markets that survive on pilgrim’s coin. For a good long while, The Western Tower was one such subject, because if people visited the tower, then mostly came up through old Sisli. So that’s what the tower was in Mandri’s mind, a hollow icon, symbol of greed, a perversion of a perversion, a scene rendered cheaply on kulp wood panels; the needle-like black tower set smack dab in the middle of the pass, though not in the middle of the painting, for the tower is always placed on that crutch for middling artists called the golden third. They do what they can with the sky and clouds, but it’s always a static scene, the black tower and its walls plugging up the pass, and travelers - more like a line of ants - being forced to pass through the tower’s gate for there’s no other way through. What’s clear is that this tower takes its role as a monument seriously. It stands there and forces all to reckon with it, a spike of unnatural black in a barren, red world; it doesn’t belong, and that’s all one can ask from a good monument, be big, and look like you don’t belong.
These paintings are sometimes titled, ‘The Gate of Shis’, though they’re never so haunting. The real approach to the Tower, however, was another matter. The paintings couldn’t capture how the brittle rock slopes threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri every time a lizard stirred from its nook at his approach.
It wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks. Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their Hrkan pursuit, so he pursued a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn’t ask, he kept quiet lest he draw a fusillade of annoyed glances for asking a simple question.
Everyone kept quiet, whatever cheer had for making out of the was gone now that word of Obo’s prediction had spread amongst them. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof of the Greskalun’s presence, and their legs had picked up the pace, until it all came to halt when they rounded a shale-strewn corner and the Goree pass opened up before them.
Tall, black stone walls sprawled across the gap, and the great tower stood proudly, right in the middle, just as the paintings had predicted. Unlike the paintings, there weren’t any people, no trickle of ants passing into the tower’s mouth, though the mouth was wide open.
The Greskalun were not there. No one was. There wasn’t a sign they’d be back. The scene was of tombs and ghost towns, tribes driven out from the .
Ayram summoned Moto with brusque a jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
“Maybe they all retreated into their sanctuary,” said Seb. Seb was chewing two spines at once so his words were garbled in slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“I don’t know,” Seb said defensively. Moteah’s question was earnest, but Seb seemed to take it as an accusation. He hadn’t really thought that far ahead, and didn’t like being confronted with that fact.
Purl took notice of this and her soft, lips were sigh-smiling in a, and offered up a suggestion. “Maybe it’s the pox,” she said.
Seb’s eyes went bright of revelation. “That could be it! It’s happened before, right? That’s what they do whenever the pox gets them, they run back into their sanctuary and stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
Moteah remained unconvinced. “Where’s the sign of fire?”, she asked, and when Seb looked at her like she’d , she clarified by saying, “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
Mandri Wooden structures set up against the walls.
“I don’t think we should go in,” Purl said. “It’s cursed.”
“Hogwash,” said Seb. 
Mandri said, “You guys know the story about the how the Goree Pass was created, right?”
“Yes, we know.”
“I wasn’t sure. It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since pretty much forever.”
“It ain’t cursed.”
“It’s only cursed if you’re from Solket.”
There was, all this while, a faint whispering in the air. The first time Mandri heard it, it cricked his neck, the second time, he stopped and turned around asked, “What is that?” 
Moto brushed past Mandri and said, “It’s vultures.” He pointed up. Mandri looked up and saw nothing but a sinuous stripe of blue sky being squeezed by the canyon face. Then he heard the sound again, and on queue, there was a speck in the sky, a vulture soaring on thermals high overhead, in sight for only a moment as it curled back around towards whence it came. 
The faint, wheezing screeches of birds, filtering down through the canyon to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. Knowing what he knew about carrion eaters, Mandri thought he might prefer it if the whispering really was the haggard language of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s curse.

aimless palpations in search of something that feels like the truth.”
“Every source, Hrkan not, agrees that during Solraheen’s first quiescence -”
“Mandri, it’s not worth it.”
Irritation in Seb at not being taken seriously.
“What could you possibly know about it?” 
“You keep asking that… I have perfect knowledge of the historical record, and the record says that those who travel the pass are cursed.”
Seb “The outland tribes use the pass all the time,” he said.
“And look how well that’s going for them.”
“Ever since the first tribesman wandered through the pass and was struck dead by a bolt of lightning, it’s been one catastrophe after the next.”
“If curses worked, the Hrkan Lords would have choked in their sleep a long, long time ago.”
A whistle. Alertness
Ayram turned and all fell silent. He marched over to Mandri, and Mandri looked up at Ayram, fearing he’d done or said something wrong. 
“Take off you’re pack,” Ayram grumbled. Mandri did as he was told, swung Obo’s litter off his shoulder and handed the Mazyd to Ayram.
Face close.
“Did you people have something to do with this?”
There was nothing of Obo but his bald, head. 
“No,” he said
Purl stepped into the circle and pointed an accusatory finger at the Mazyd. “He knew the Greskalun wouldn’t be here, and that was miles ago.”
Obo flicked his penetrating eye towards Purl. “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems,” he said. “I know you types abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when-.”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
“Yes, but all the same, the Hrks didn’t do it. The Goree pass is not yet in sight of the Hrkan lords.”
Purl snapped at that remark, though her way of snapping was subdued. “Everything is in sight of the Hrkan lords,” she said.
This drew a pronounced sigh from Obo. The was rolling off his tongue. “Maybe so. Maybe so,” he said, and then, “I don’t suppose that any of you have an appreciation for how much grain it takes to sustain a fortification of that size. And this surrounding area isn’t exactly fertile land.” Obo, head , looked down at the gravel strewn sand to prove his point. “If any of you were students of history, you might know that anytime there’s a drought in the river plain yonder south, this tower is the first to feel it. I suspect that’s what’s happened here; the Greskalun began to starve and simply moved on to greener pastures.”
Elrahet. It was the first words Mandri had heard her speak for days. The words came from her throat as if they were not used to them. “Gresh - hghhmmm - Greskal would not abandon the pass,” she said.
“As may be,” Obo said, “but hunger makes people act out of character.”
Ayram stepped in to clarify. “Greskal’s line has a sacred duty to this place. They would not willingly leave.”
Obo looked at Ayram with eyes. “What do you think a person is willing to do when hunger sets in?”
Ayram smiled. “Greskal and his kin aren’t soft-bellied Hrks. They know hunger, they know suffering, they also know Solraheen.”
“Then you agree. Why would ‘soft-bellied Hrks’ want to live in a place like this? If there was a system of support in place, then… If you are asking me if there are Hrkans waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. I suspect no one is.”
Seb spat in Obo’s general direction. The loogie just missed Obo’s litter and splated harmlessly on a rock. Obo smiled at the affront, the way a smiles when . 
Seb scowled back, then said to Ayram, “The Greskalun could still be there. Pox, drought, it doesn’t matter - when things go bad for them, they go into the mountain. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah.
“Or maybe not,” Obo said, his tone suggesting . Instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter, his elbows stretching the leather as they twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it. Obo looked like a toddler all swaddled up in his pack, trying to get comfortable.
“What are you doing?” Moteah wondered.
With effort, Obo poked his hand up and out of the neck of his pouch, he widened the opening, and then up popped the ball-joint of a bone. 
“What in the world?” Seb exclaimed.
“Where did you get that?” Moteah asked.
“Back a little ways,” said Obo. “It was sticking out of the ground next to a molar-looking boulder. Honestly, I’m surprised you all missed it.”
Obo pulled the bone fully out of his pack and held it aloft for all to see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This,” said Obo, “Is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
“You find one bone and you think them dead?” said Seb. “One bone in the ground? A bone in the ground isn’t unusual. Where else are you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Oh, let him speak,” said Moteah.
Seb looked to Ayram for support, but Ayram was standing silent as usual, narrowing the world between just him and whatever he was looking at, and he was looking at that bone.
Obo turned it round in his hands and said, “Every bone tells a story… gender, age, health, and you see this fracture? It’s an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
Obo ran his finger along the length of the fracture. It wasn’t a clean fracture, a , it was a splintered fracture along the length of it, an open tube.
“It’s broken bone,” Seb said, unimpressed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, well that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this… it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
In Ayrams probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “If your point is that this person was killed,” he said, “that’s not unusual.”
“I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the pass,” Mandri said.
“We’re not in the pass,” Ayram said. 
Obo pointed to a purplish discoloration on the legbone, and said, “And see this splotch here? This bone is not old.”
“So what?” Seb said. “A recent killing. It doesn’t explain why a hundred Greskalun aren’t here.”
“It wasn’t simply a killing,” said Obo. “This medial split… A blow to the leg would not crack the bone like that. Sure, it could happen, but the chances of that occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Elrahet grumbled.
Obo said, “I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough food to eat, and so the people started eating other people.”
Ayram turned the bone around with a bit more care.
“You see, that is the kind of fracture a cannibal makes when he wants open the bone up like a treasure chest so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside.”
Ayram , and Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of a barbarian gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, teeth strings of fat and 
Elrahet stomped over and took the bone from Ayram’s grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the. She turned the whole thing over in her hands, thumbed a groove with some contemplation, then handed the bone right back. She and Ayram shared a look, and the two in unison turned their backs on the others and marched off to where they could share words unheard.
Unheard to all except Obo.
“What are they saying?” Mandri whispered out the side of his mouth.
“I’m not quite sure,” said Obo. “They seem to be speaking in riddles…”
A moment passed and by the Ayram and Elrahet reached some conclusion.
“Well?”
“I suppose we shall find out.”
“So what are we doing?”
“We wait for Moto.”
They did not have to wait long. Almost as soon as he spoke the words, Moto came running out of the Tower’s mouth, 
When he arrived, breathless and , he did not wait for any questions. “There’s something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
“I climbed the tower,” he said in between catching breath. “There’s no Greskalun. That much I know.”
“And the Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see.” Moto looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
Ayram cast a glance aside at Elrahet, and old witch nodded.
“Pick up the Mazyd. You’re walking up front with me.”
At pace they came to the tower and it’s gate. Cobbled nature, ancient, leaning just so, Mandri looked up, and from this sharp angle he could see how the tall tower didn’t quite go straight up, the carpet of it’s bricks bulged, twisted, and leaned forward ever so slightly, come crashing down on him. And then there was the arch of the gate, by the gate’s long metal teeth which hung ominously above Ayram’s head. The tunnel itself was as large as the hall of the Hrkhale, big enough to send the sound of Ayram’s spud bar thumping against the dirt rushing back at them. Aside from this metronomic beat, they passed through this dark in silence, casting wary glances at each large doorframe that pocketed the arching brickwork, drifts of sand sagging against each frame. Moto in front, a guide. 
He stops.
Looks back, shadow over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick courtyard as old as the tower itself, dusted and with centuries of wagon of wagon traffic wearing wheel ruts into road, tracking all the way up the gently rising slope that lead into the darkness of the canyoned pass.
In this courtyard was a haphazard scattering of wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly and taller than,  sticking out of the ground like an errant volley of arrows. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
Desecrations, all of them. Cursed heaps of tortured souls. Such was the defilement that the condemnations leaped into Mandri’s mind as readily as the very sight of the profane sculptures themselves, which themselves were so present that Mandri’s stomach into fits of convulsion.
The nearest was but five yards away - a man, who, like many, was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound the man’s hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, was stuck in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore as the broken pottery that was his skull seemed kept together by the grace of god.
Mandri knew enough to know that the injuries inflicted on this poor man had some special significance. In the darker halls of Hrkan lords there hung portraits of martyrs which made rich use of similar tortures. Mandri never paid them much mind because the common consensus was that to even look upon such sights was dangerous. And here he was, standing before thirty of them - maybe there were fifty - to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place.
The only clear statement that Mandri could interpret here, aside from the plain blasphemy of it, lay in the chain wrapped tight around the man’s neck, a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was; it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic.
That was the least of the indignities done to this man. His scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding, and a ring of hair was left to fashion a gleaming madman’s crown. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were filled with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor souls littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Mandri noticed Obo peeking out from his litter.
Mandri said, careful that the Ayramun did not hear, “I guess we know what happened to the Greskalun.”
“These are not the Greskalun,” Obo whispered back.
“They’re not?”
“These are pilgrims.”
“How’d they get like this?”
“I’d very much like to know that myself.”
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Purl had sunk to her knees, half a gesture of prayer, half a despondent . Seb, a man who could not stand still, was standing as still as dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. Elrahet hadn’t even stepped foot in the courtyard. She had fallen behind and was sitting deep inside the dark shadow of the tunnel on an inset doorstep. Only the outline of her knees could be seen. Mandri supposed that her witchy senses had warned her of what lay ahead, and she’d decided against polluting her mind with the sight of it. Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever, and even still the great pack on his shoulders seemed weightless.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast a eye back at his mournful band.
“I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, but didn’t think he had this in him. I’m almost impressed.”
“All the better then,” said Seb as he did a little hop to settle his pack more comfortably on his shoulders. “We should keep going.”
Mandri The apparent indifference of the two men drew a murderous look from Moteah. She seemed particularly eager to stick Seb up on one of those poles. It pricked him right in between the eyes, but he shrugged it off.
“Who cares if a few holy Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em?”, he said. “Besides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em cuz we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah said.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“This is not normal.”
“The thing to do is keep going! The Greskalun have got to be -”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?”. Seb gestured broadly at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates the Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
“Greskal would never do anything like this.”
Before Seb could get another word in, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right,” she said.
Her voice was right at Mandri’s neck, tickling the backs of his ears. He, like everyone else, spun around and peered dumbly into the darkness of the tunnel. A rattling sigh emanated out from it, and then the shadow of Elrahet stood up. Where before Mandri had been impressed with her verve, she walked now with a hobbling hitch in her step that was hard to place. Was it her left leg or right? Her hip?
“They must have sensed the panic,” she said.
More likely all the joints were aching and the lurching was due to whichever one screamed out most. It was as if every minute of the long years of her life were suddenly set upon her.
“Not Greskal’s panic, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age, the panic of nations - that’s what gets their stomachs growling.”
Into the light. 
“Can you sense it, Mazyd? I know you’ve got sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic, or have you been swimming in it so long that you can’t even tell it’s there?”
“I can tell when someone’s pissed themselves, if that’s what you’re asking?”
“PANIC!” she screamed. “It’s panic which sets their stomachs growling. Wakes them right up.”
Seb said, “What are you talkin’ bout old crone?”
Elrahet’s lip curled to reveal her snaggletooth grin.
“Demons,” she said.
The word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a unexpected expense. 
“This is not the work of the Greskalun,” she said. “This was demons.”
Seb was struck into speechlessness, though a sneer still scrunched his grizzled face. To Elrahet, that sneer was as good as saying something. She shot him a side-eyed and said, “Oh, shut up.”
so with confusion that he could not stop himself from speaking out of turn.
“You’re talking about, demon demons?”
Elrahet spat. “Say the word a few more times and you might summon them.”
Mandri wanted to say that there were, indeed, other kinds. People could be demons, that’s not an uncommon figure of speech. People could have done this. Or, people infested with demons, that’s not unheard of either. A crowd of the demon possessed could have done this. These explanations satisfied expectations. A demon demons, a real demons, that is an extraordinary claim which requires extraordinary evidence.
And what evidence was there?
None save the butchery.
Mandri looked for holes in the courtyard floor where winged demonic terrors might have come bursting up through brick, but there were none. There was no cackling laughter, no claw-marks, no hoof-prints. He wanted to point all of this out and demand that Elrahet recant her story, but what kind of person would he be then, to correct a bloodwitch on the matter of demons? He’d be a hypocrite. He’d be rejecting someone else’s expertise. So instead, he stayed silent and waited for someone else to take up the challenge. The longer no one did, the more that it was possible.
It was possible…
He tried to shake the thought out of his head, but that didn’t work. It was a fact that it was possible… but a fact of possibility is no real fact at all. It was possible that a cloud of demons had poured forth from a fissure and set themselves upon these poor pilgrims. It was also possible that they’d flogged each other and tied themselves up… somehow.
And there wasn’t one questioning look amongst the Ayramun. Not one, except for Seb, and he didn’t count.
“Ain’t no demons,” Seb muttered.
Moteah absent-minded hostility, “Seb, if you don’t think that demons did it, then that’s proof enough that they did.”
Mandri hoped that someone more sane would step forward and present some other explanation for what had happened here, but none did. Ayram, still the picture of serious contemplation and said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
Seb raised “There ain’t nothin’ we can do for ‘em!”he declared.
“Seb,”
“He’s actually right. First time in his dumb life. There’s nothing we can do for these people.”
“Damn right,” Seb said. “Dead is dead.”
“Oh, they aren’t dead,” said Elrahet.
“What?”
Elrahet pointed at the carnage with her walking stick and said loudly, that Seb could not twist her words.
“They - are - not - dead.”
The words flew like spittle from her lip.
Mandri looked with fresh eyes upon the nearby pilgrim, and what he saw was death. Death was not all that familiar a sight for him, but he’d seen enough to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. Mandri was certain there was no way he could still be alive. 
He looked closer. His wounds were quite peculiar. The rubbed raw skin on the outside of his thigh, for example, was no mere abrasion, there white rings of fresh skin circumscribing a freshly festering, leaking scab.
The flesh might still be alive, but Mandri had seen a chicken running without a head before.
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pligrim’s torso shuddered, his head jerked back and his tongue reached out of his open mouth, trying the slightes sip of a breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs.
“MANDRI!”
Mandri froze at the mention of his name.
It was Elrahet.
Her knobby finger was pointing at a thin line of blood sprinkled on the ground. It was fresh blood, but not hers or anyone else’s. It had been there without Mandri consciously noticing it, blood that should have seeped into the brick and stained it, or otherwise been lapped up by the sun, and yet there it was, ravishing red, and it ran in a circle around the pilgrim’s pole.
The toe of his boot was almost touching it.
He jumped back.
“Would that have been bad?”
Elrahet looked him up and down. Unsatisfied 
“No. Would not have been a great loss.”
With that she turned and began to hobble back into the tunnel. When no one made an immediate move to follow, she stopped and said, “We need to leave. Now.”
Purl said, “We should do what we can for them.”
Moto said, “We could kill them. That would put an end to this.”
“Their very Sparks are bound to the poles,” said Elrahet. “Death would not grant them freedom.” She stamped the dry ground with her short staff and said, “No. We must leave at once.”
As this was going on, Mandri came to a startling realization: he hadn’t the slightest idea about how Elrahet . He hadn’t considered, until this very moment, the he might have given up something that he didn’t want. How could a person know how to bind a Spark to a pole with having done it themselves?
His reverie was broken when Ayram’s giant boots started as he walked into the tunnel.
Seb called out after him, “Hold on, we’re goin’ back!?”. He threw his shoulders a fretful fit. “What about the Greskalun?!” He waved his arms towards the foreboding pass, as if the Greskalun were just right there and you only had to turn back and look to see them.
Moteah brushed passed him and said through a curled lip, “There are no Greskalun.”
Seb stood his ground. “You can’t know that! You can’t know they ain’t there til we go and have a look. We’ve at least got to try.”
“Seb, there’s demons!”
“No there ain’t! And even if there was, they can’t be worse than Hrks!”
As soon as the words had left his mouth, there came from the west a sharp and distant bleat of a Hrkan horn of war.
bwwweeeeOOOOOOOOooooooo
The horn call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and before Ayram could bark an order, a distant horse and rider came galloping out from around a shelf of sandstone.
The horse, white as foam, came stumbling to a stop and reared up almost to the point of no control. The rider, a man as dark as Moto and clad in the familiar blue robe of a Riga scribe, shouted a command to his beast to settle it down, and all the while his face was trained on the tunnel where Mandri and the Ayramun stood.
The feeling of being found when you don’t want to be is a horrible, horrible feeling. To Mandri it was like waking up from sleep. He spends the night in the blissful embrace of sleep and then a moment later he finds himself awake. It was always horrible. It hearkened back to the day of birth, when he was resting comfortably in the hiding place that was the womb, and then suddenly, cruelly, he was found. In a way, life was one long journey of finding a nice hidey hole and then being rudely pulled from it, then finding another, and being pulled out of that one too. And once found, there’s no going back - he couldn’t be unfound. He could be found and then lost, but being lost is always tainted with the history of being found, so it’s not the same - not the same in the slightest. At some point, people give up chasing that false dream of losing themselves permanently in a hidey hole, and while Mandri wasn’t quite there yet, in front of him was a Hrkan horde, and behind him was a corpse strewn courtyard, so he wondered if there was a point in trying to run away from this one.
Seb seemed to think so. He was already there in the courtyard, wanting everyone else to follow him into the pass.
“Come on!” he urged.
Ayram did the opposite, he unshouldered his great pack and tossed it against the side of the tunnel. 
The Hrkan rider was now trotting towards them. In this scribe’s hand was a sword, and he held it high so that the blade and golden guard caught the glare of the sun. When he had covered a quarter of the distance, he halted his horse, barked some indiscernible word, and then, with a sweeping flourish, threw his sword onto the sand.
Moto, who’d been halfway ready to sprint and tying off parts of his dress to make himself ready for battle, saw the scribe’s sign and gaped in disbelief. “They want to bargain?”
The Hrkan horn sounded out agian.
bwwweeeeOOOOoooooooooo
Then, from around the shelf whence the scribe had come, At their head was a child robed in black - the Mazydariga.
Purl said, “Oooookay, I think we should leave.”
Obo’s piped up, “I think we should stay.”
“If you’ve something to say, then say it.”
“That Riga out there could have whistled out my spark by now, but it hasn’t. Those soldiers could be charging towards this tower , but they aren’t, they’re keeping a safe distance. There’s not much to read into this - these people actually mean to bargain.”
“But why?”
“The same reason anyone bargains - they don’t think they can take what they want without getting hurt.”
M
 “Maybe they think the Greskalun are here and on our side.”
“Maybe it’s the demons they’re scared of. I bet they were ones consorting with them.”
Obo sho “Your guesses are as good as mine, though I don’t think they’re scared of some fantastical beasts.”
“There’s no real way to know unless you talk to them.”

Ayram walked out of the tunnel, spud bar in hand, and stood just outside the entrance. 


Man on a horse coming out. 
Horse is skittish, wont go near ayram.
“Are you Greskal?”
“I am not.”
Somehow, the answer was unexpected.
“Are you the master of this tower?”
“We just got here. It seems this tower has no master. It’s empty, save for me and mine.”
“We know the lord Mazyd Obo resides in this tower.”
“I’m not trying to hide that fact.” 
“Then bring him forth, I wish to speak with him.”
“No. You can speak with me, and I will pass your message along.”
The scribal ferret frowned.
“This is not the time for games. We found the body of the Mazydariga of Shuls out in the desert. We know your Lord Mazyd has some means of dismantling the Riga. We know that the’s escaped the leash of his Minder. As such, we wish to come to terms with him, so as to avoid any further loss of life.”
Perturbed. Back and forth.
“What are your terms?”
“Tell your lord Mazyd Obo, that into the eastern mouth of the Pass marches a battalion of Hrkan soldiers, and at their head is the Mazyd of Shurni. Behind me, as you can see, is the Riga of Aym, and coming up from the Shulraket is the Mazyd Doon, who shall be with us shortly. As such, you are surrounded, and should it come to blows you will be overwhelmed. There is no way out excepting the event in which you fellows peaceably disarm yourselves and the lord Mazyd Obo offers himself up into my charge. In exchange, all lives will all be spared, and the Lord Mazyd shall be allowed to retire into quiescence after submitting to examination.”
“I don’t much like those terms,” he said.
The scribe frowned and his horse, almost as if it shared his frustration.
“This is not a matter for you to decide,” he said. “Bring out the lord Mazyd Obo.”
Ayram stroked his beard, and then he looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he took in a breath that could fill a horse’s stomach. When he turned round there was a fire in his eyes which Mandri had not seen since Minting Rock, and when Ayram marched over to where Mandri stood, and reached over his shoulder, Mandri was rooted to the spot simmering just under the surface.
Ayram reached over Mandri’s shoulder, pulled Obo out from his litter by the skull, and in one rude, fluid motion, Ayram flung the Mazyd towards the scribe.
The black horse whinnied in alarm as Obo’s withered, legless form slid pitifully on the dirt towards it, and the scribe’s eyes were agog with disbelief.
“What is this?” the scribe asked as struggled to settle his horse’s fright.
Ayram stepped towards Obo, casual as a dog , and he pointed to Obo with his blackened iron bar and said, “You don’t recognize a Mazyd when you see one?”
And all this was to Mandri. Was that Obo, usually unperturbed by rough treatment, usually amused by seriousness, was himself in a serious concern. It seemed the he was afraid to move or speak, lest he upset the delicate tension that was building.
The scribe himself was not so. His face twisted into wry smile at the sight of Obo naked and afraid.
“This Mazyd still has a Minder?” the scribe asked.
Ayram gestured towards Purl, and the scribes face went alight at the sight of the girl’s missing hand.
“You mean to say that… You mean that this is…”
“It’s exactly what it looks like.”
“This simplifies things…” the old man mused. The wry smile that spread out on his lips suggested it simplified things in his favor. He rocked back in his saddle, and as he did, smugly, 
 He , and seemed to relish in the sight of Obo being brought so low, but his amusement was cut short when his horse  agitation and began to clip-clop it’s agitation, bouncing the scribe uncomfortably in his saddle. 
“Settled down you crooked beast!” the old man shouted. He gave his horse a foul kick in the ribs.
“I shouldn’t be surprised. All this is nothing but a ransom…”
“Of course! What other reason is there for one such as I to capture a Mazyd?
“I can think of many, but I can assure you, they all end in death.”
“We are not fanatics. We’d very much like to live, but we’d like to live comfortably, if you understand my meaning.”
Annoyed as something as trivial as this.
“Before I ask what you want, I should warn you about what Solraheen has to say about the inequities of greed.”
“I’m familiar.”
“Of course you are… Then what is it that you want? Be sure your eyes are not bigger than your stomach.”
“What have you brought?
“We’re a fighting force, not merchants.”
“If you don’t have anything to trade, then how can we come to a deal?”
The scribe stirred in his saddle and .
“If we did have something of value… As soon as you hand over the Mazyd, there’s nothing to stop us from hunting you down.”
“I’m not worried about that.”
“You should be.”
“We could lose ourselves in the mountains long before you ever . If your soldiers retreat two hundred yards, I’d say that would give us a comfortable head start.” 
“That’s acceptable, as long as we make the exchange halfway.”
“If we met halfway, then your men wouldn’t be a few hundred yards away. The exchange happens right here, or not at all.“
The scribe frustration. He looked up, took in the tower, the spied the distance
“I won’t do this business in the shadow of this accursed place. We’ll make the exchange where the tower’s shadow meets the light of Solraheen.”
With the sun approaching it’s zenith, the tower’s shadow extended out into the desert a mere forty yards or so.
“Fair enough,” said Ayram.
But the scribe was not finished with his conditions. “As for the Mazyd, we wont carry it around unless it’s been made safe to carry.”
Ayram nodded and said, “You’ll be free to take him as you wish.”
“To be clear,” said the scribe, “there are only two ways make a Mazyd safe - a Riga’s whistle, or the Mazyd’s minder must be killed. As our Riga’s whistle does not work, your girl must be killed.”
The scribe said this as if he were speaking of slaughtering livestock. Worse than livestock. He didn’t even honor Purl with a callous, appraising eye.
Put a simmer of anger in Ayram’s deep voice. “There are other ways,” said Ayram.
“Such as?”
Ayram turned towards Elrahet with the gleam of expectation in his eyes. She stepped forward out of the tunnel and said.
“If I had use of your Riga, good sir, I could render the Mazyd inert.”
“How?”
 “The knowledge is beyond you. I do not mean to inflict illusions. Be sure that the Riga child will not survive the process.”
“You’ll use the Riga child to pull the dirty Spark from the Mazyd?”
“Yes.”
“Aren’t you forgetting something?”
“What?”
“You’ve yet to mention what you’re offering in return.”
“It is an object of great value. I can’t tell you what it is, because I would be breaking a vow if I did. You will know it when you see it, and I can assure you, you will find the trade most equitable.”
With that, the scribe yanked on his horse’s reins, jabbed it’s flanks with his heels and they went galloping back towards the Hrkan line.  
Ayram turned around around, and on his face a smile as white and gleaming as. Maybe it was the biggest smile humanly possible, considering the size of his head.
“Solraheen smiles on us!” He said. 
“Wonder what he’s going to try to trade.”
“He’s not bringing anything. The dumb bastard thinks he take me. He’s going to bring the riga right to us.”
“Everyone needs to get ready to run.”
“Run where?”
“You weren’t serious about hiding in the mountains, were you?”
“Don’t worry about it.”
“Oh, I’m gonna worry about it.”
“Once I strike that man down, we need to run. I’m not going to stop help any of you get your shit together, so if you’re not ready, if you fall behind, you’re dead.”
He untied the strap that kept his pack shut, then lifted it up and dumped the pack’s contents on the floor.
“Split this up between you.”
Then he grabbed Obo, and stuffed the Mazyd into his empty pack.
Once inside, a oddly compliant Obo said, “You know, I could ruin this for you.”
Ayram glared down into the pack as if he were ready to murder Obo right then and there.
“I’m not going to ruin it,” Obo said. “I just wanted you all to know that I could have, but I’m not.”
Ayram pulled his pack’s drawstring tight. “The best thing about all this,” he said, “Is that we’ll finally be rid of this noise.”
A rustling is Ayram’s pack as Obo worked to poke his head out of it. Once is bald head was, a, he shouted, “Mandri! Never let it be said that I didn’t do anything for these people!”
Mandri felt himself knotting up as Obo’s pale saucer eyes fixed on him - him and no one else. Odd that he should feel this way for so strange a face, though framed as Obo was against Ayram’s absurd physique, Obo almost looked normal. Or, maybe that had nothing to do with it. Some mothers love children with faces much worse off than Obo’s… not that Mandri was feeling something as deep as love. It wasn’t odd to feel sad for someone who’d had a rough life. Suppose that Obo truly didn’t feel pain, or chose not to, all the abuse still had to have some effect on his mind or sense of self, and if that weren’t true, it didn’t matter, because Mandri could be sad at the sight of a wilting flower and flowers don’t feel pain or sadness, they don’t have minds at all. But flowers are beautiful, and beauty certainty wasn’t in play here. The pang that Mandri now felt in his chest as he watched a compliant Obo being carried off to his doom was a pang of loss, yes, but loss of what? He wasn’t sure.
And, oh! This was a problem. He couldn’t ignore the budding sense that something was being uncovered here, and as any self-watcher knows, finding things out about oneself is the worst kind of finding. So Mandri tried to ignore it. He looked away from Obo, and And he transformed that pang from loss to guilt start to wrap it’s cold hands around his lungs.
Right as these thoughts began to coalesce into a monster, Moto yanked the litter right off Mandri’s back and began to fill it with the stuff that had fallen out of Ayram’s pack; skins of water, sticky bars of grain, lumps of something wrapped in linen paper and the like. When Moto handed the pack back to Mandri, it was twice the weight that Obo ever was. 
Then other Ayramun began to do the same, fill their packs with Ayram’s stuff, and Seb, in an attempt to reorganize his pack’s interior to make room for a bundle of dried beef, pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, pulled his bag of burgeons out as well. When the burgeon bag hit the ground, out popped three God’s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri’s toes by Solraheen himself.
Mandri covered it up with his foot.
When Seb finally noticed that his burgeons had spilled out, he snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that he was short one burgeon.
For Mandri, the feeling of that burgeon under his heel was almost enough in iteself to drive away the guilt.

Try to get Mandri to commit to helping Obo.  Hint at  the guilt earlier. Need to set up this moment of sadness.

WHO IS “BEST THING TO DO” GUY? MANDRI OR SEB?????

 as clean as a hound’s tooth 

BUT if they are discounting the demon threat - why are they worried earlier when they turn around. - would need to change that from fearing demons to greskalun just aren’t here. ‘If the Greskalun have let the demons get this uppity, then they aren’t here.’

            <Title>Exchange</Title>
            <Text>The first floor of the tower was nearly as dark as a cave, composed of a single hallway running north to south, and in the middle of this hall, on either side, were sets of wide oaken double doors that opened up into large dust-strewn storage rooms that nothing in them but stone pillars. At the end of the hall was a staircase.
The second floor was a single room, pillars included, and four paces around the circumference, there was a narrow window. Scant rays of light filtered in through the slits in the eastern side, while the views through the windows to the west were obstructed by the forms of Ayramun jostling to get a better look at the Hrkan horse and rider as they trotted towards their leader on the sand below. 
Mandri watched all this from the staircase. Once he was ready, he ducked down into the dark of the first floor to dab one meager droplet of juice from the God’s Eye burgeon onto his tongue. No more than that; the idea was to escape, not end up catatonic like before. He then plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a tightly rolled scrap of woolen rag, and he stuffed the thing in his pocket for later. If he rationed it carefully, he could make it last a week. Then, maybe, he could steal another.
He sat down on the fourth stair-step and waited there in the dark for the burgeon-sight to take hold. He knew it wouldn’t take long.
Purl got to him first.
“Where’s Mandri?”, she asked from above.
Mandri couldn’t hide his disappointment when he said, “I’m here! I’m here.”
Not wanting to seem , he stood up, and climbed up rest of the stairs to be with the others.
Out of the four Ayramun, Purl was the only one who wasn’t glued to the western window. She was sitting against the eastern wall, still strapped into her pack. 
“Don’t take it off,” Purl said to him when she noticed he was wanting to be rid of his own pack. 
“Why not?”
“We need to be ready to run.
“It only takes a second to put it on.”
“Leave it on.”
“Fine,” said Mandri, and he plopped himself down right next Purl, pack and all.
He leaned into her and said, “Do you have any idea how we’re supposed to get out of this?”
“Ayram has a plan.”
“Didn’t seem like it to me. His words, if I recall, were, ‘I’ll figure it out’.”
“When he says that it’s because he knows we won’t like the plan.”
“Seems like he’s winging it to me.”
Mandri 
“Why are you sweating?”
“I’m stressed. And my pack is heavy.”
“But it’s cold in here.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t know.”
He wasn’t about to say that burgeons make his heart beat faster, and that gets him worried and sweating about it even though it happens every time.
“Are you that sad about Obo?”, Purl asked.
“I’m not sad, I’m… I don’t know how to describe it.”
“The first time I saw Obo, I watched him kill thirty Ayramun, and if you asked me then if it was possible that I could feel anything but anger about him, I would have smacked you in the face for suggesting it.”
“But you can’t bring yourself to blame him, can you?”
“It’s infuriating.”
Mandri sank lower into his pack, which was quite comfy with all the new additions.
“The thing that gets me is that I feel guilty,” he said. “There’s nothing I could have done for him, so why do I feel guilty?”

Mandri sighed and looked up at the ceiling. He said, “Life is horrible. I can’t think of one person who isn’t miserable.”
“God, you’re so dumb.”
“Who do you think has it good?”
“Most people who aren’t us.”
“The most miserable sap I've ever seen was a Hrkan prince. I looked into his eyes and it was like he was already old, and it wasn't a ‘just-happy-to-be-here’ old, it was that joyless, ‘I-wish-I-could-be-you’ old.”
“I bet those pilgrims on those poles would prefer to be a Hrkan Prince.”
“Okay, yes, there’s levels to misery, but that doesn’t change the fact that everyone is some shade of miserable.”
“No, you are miserable, and so you think everyone else is.&quot;
&quot;Name me one person who isn’t some shade of miserable.”
“Me.”
“You can lie all you want, but that doesn’t change the facts.”
“I get sad and I get over it. Miserable people don’t get over it.”
“Look me in the eyes and tell me you’ve gotten over losing your hand for no fucking good reason.”
Purl’s face scrunched up in revulsion, as if Mandri had just threatened to reach down and rip the scab off her wrist.
“You’re such a fucking prick,” she said.
“Why? Because I’m right?”
Purl fixed Mandri in her gaze and tried to tell him, with every ounce of persuasive power in her soft brown skin, and her freckled , that he was completely missing the point. It was an expression that Mandri had seen a thousand times on a hundred different faces and somehow he’d yet to ascertain its meaning. To him it meant the other person had run of out of arguments and so he’d won.
“How about Obo, then?”
That was not something he’d considered.
“What about him?”
“He’s got every right to be as miserable as you, but he’s not.”
Mandri sat back and considered the truth of it.
“Oh shit.”
She was right. Well, she wasn’t right, because Obo wasn’t human and so he didn’t count.   Still, it was a kind of revelation: Obo was the one thinking creature in this entire goddamn world who wasn’t miserable. Obo was capable of getting over the wrongs done to him. In this respect, he was like a dog, he had that forgive and forget. This realization triggered another: the reason, and why the dog worshipers of Solk had good reasons to worshiped dogs.
“Ah, fuck.”
That droplet from the God’s Eye burgeon wasn’t doing shit. It wasn’t expanding the ceiling into infinity, it wasn’t swirling the colors of the floor, and it wasn’t tamping down on the sadness that was of Obo’s impending doom.
Mandri briefly considered gulping down the rest of the burgeon juice, then decided against it when his heart was strafed by the shame of not bearing witness to Obo’s final moments. If he didn’t watch, then no one who cared would, and a memory such as this should not be the sole property of people who didn’t understand what was happening.
So he shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his heavy pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.
“Going to watch?”, Purl asked.
“Might as well.”
He walked over to the western window where Moto, Moteah, and Seb were huddled. The window seemed to glow. At first, there wasn’t room enough for him between Moto and Moteah’s excited elbows, then Moto decided that these moments would be better spent doing something else, so he left and Mandri was able to squeeze himself into the picture before Seb and Moteah could close ranks.
When Mandri looked down upon the scene, his vision was flooded with the light of revelation.
This was not normal burgeonsight. There were no sparkling lights or glistening surfaces. What he saw was purpose itself, tangible purpose, not a thing that can be delimited with words, for each element of the scene was it’s own irreducible purpose, and they were each connected to each other. Ayram. Elrahet. The Scribe, his horse, the Riga. Obo lying in the dirt. The valley mouth and the desert beyond it. The tower’s shadow ascribing the position of the sun. The tower itself. The stone that formed the window-sill under Mandri’s fingers. Every element here was wrought with the history of purpose, and Mandri could see it, he could look at a thing and know its purpose, and these many threads were hereby joined by Mandrameen himself, for his purpose was to tie it all together, for his sight was the f man to capture the scene: the figures below arranged in a pyramidal frame; Ayram and Elrahet anchoring bottom corners, the scribe on his white horse at the top, with Obo on the ground bridging the gap between them. This was not mere symbolism - symbolism is what artists invent when they can’t see the true purpose, no, this composition was a living, breathing arrangement put together by a divine providence, and such it was real, Purpose in and of itself, transformed.
The scribe, that dark Hrkan man, he did not represent Hrkan power advantaged on a proud steed, he was that power, and in his lap was the Riga child, the very embodiment of Hrk’s assault on the sanctity of creation. Ayram was not a symbol of the outland peoples, he was their paragon, and sidling up next to him was Elrahet, who was old desert ways made manifest and given agency. In between these two parties was Mazyd Obo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of men in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked. The others looked past him as if he weren’t there.
Mandri lamented the lack of materials. If he’d only had a stick of charcoal he could have started sketching on the smooth tower stone right then and there. As vivid as this vision was, he knew it would flutter away as fast as it had come. If he didn’t sketch it out as he saw it, details would be forgotten. One night’s sleep and they’d be lost forever.
He was forced instead imprint the scene upon his mind as best he could using the mnemonic of repetition. Keep the eye jumping from detail to detail and back again, and then again, and again, and again, and at each stop, notice - this isn't the noticing of , this is the artist's noticing, the lover's noticing, covetous noticing, noticing to remember. It's not a lossless art, but what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later. It's a hope, but it was all he could do.
He noticed the arc of the tower’s shadow splitting the scene in half. Noticed its precise angle and change in curve as the shadow swerved from the upper left of the frame to the bottom right. He noticed the coolness of the shadows and it's subtle, sumptuous greys.
The size disparity between Ayram and Elrahet, easy to notice. Both dark and shrouded.
The Hrkan horse standing in the light of day. White. It's kickbacked head. It's impatient tail.
The dark Hrkan scribe in the leather saddle, his blue filigreed robe flapping , cradling the form that was the Riga. 
Obo on the ground, pale, fly-swatted, staring at the sky. So perfect was the staging that the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across his belly.  
The rest of the environment, the tower bricks, the colors of the rock and sand and their arrangement, these were static things and could be revisited. It was an injustice, abstracting them out as if they weren't contributing to the purpose of the scene, but it was all that he could do.
He ran through the details again. 
The arc of the tower’s shadow - that hadn't changed.
Ayram and Elrahet still stood resolute.rty
A Hrkan horse standing in the light. White. An impatient tail.

The dry slap of sprinting, leather-bound feet against the stone floor.
“MANDRI!”
The yelling of his name snapped Mandri out of his reverie.
The others were running for.
When he looked back west, he was stunned to see that , and Ayram was already.
God’s eye burgeon.
The urgency of the moment flooded in. As he ran towards the, that he’d already forgotten if the Scribe’s horse was facing north or south. What else had he forgotten? The come down of every hallucinogenic high, where the logic of revelation breaks down and he was left wondering if meant anything at all, or if he .
If that was the God’s Eye burgeon, why was not.
He stumbled through the darkness of the Tower’s first floor, and all knowledge of purpose was lost.

            <Title>Yellow haircloth habit</Title>
            <Text>And that leads to yet probe of depth: inaction is action all the same. That isn’t  a particularly profound bit of wisdom but there on the charnel roads the weight of inaction becomes tangible. First, of course, there’s the solitant’s yellow haircloth habit. The constant itch is supposed to be a constant reminder to not waste the moment, to be alert to even the smallest opportunities to make the world better - that’s what it’s supposed to be. Over the years, even the most devout solitant comes to see the habit as little more than a  Out on a charnel road, the habit becomes unbearable. Its not just the fact that there’s so little sensory than the itch, but the heat gets inside it, makes a pilgrim feel like they’re a pork knuckle wrapped in a blanket being slow roasted over a fire. The temptation to cast the scratchy habit aside is great, but no one ever does it. Not only would it be a renunciation of faith, but it would only make it easier for the sun to sap one’s spirit. 
On the Bazul road a twisted ankle or a tweaked knee is all but inevitable. Man’s upright gait just isn’t designed for a sustained trudge uphill through loosely packed gravel. No pilgrim has ever made the journey without stumbling a time or two, and when they fall their hands and feet get cut because the gravel isn’t smooth like riverstone, it’s been chipped unevenly by the wind and the sand. It’s got points and edges, some as sharp as blades.

Once a pilgrim actually gets on the road, the struggle against the temptation begins. For many the strongest temptation is the urge to stop and rest. Anywhere else in the world it would be a fine thing to do, but sitting down on a charnel road is a mistake because the sun still bakes you even if you aren’t moving. The sun literally kills the pilgrim who saddles tomorrows self with today’s journey. It’s a lesson that Solitants savor because no where else in the world is procrastination so cruelly punished. A man sitting down on a Charnel Road is still moving towards the point of no return. The sun is still burning his water. He sits down for a half-a-finger, a finger, or maybe two, what matters is that after a specific point in time, if he does not make the right choice, he has doomed himself. He can shout and no one will come. He can run towards the horizon but the time cannot be made up. 
It is an unusual thing to be able to pinpoint the exact moment of doom, rarer still to have one’s doom so distant from the actual moment of death. Usually a person only has a few minutes with themselves to appreciate their fate before they die, if that. Out in the Sand, it can be hours, even days. On the Bazul Road it’s not so long, but nonetheless the road has taken many a pilgrim into shiskason.
Shis-ka-son. It means, ‘death-not-prevented’. It’s the Old Jandri word for ‘doomed’ but it carries an air of blame. It’s not just an abstract concept either. To the Old Jandri mythos it’s a heightened state of mind, when the weight of one’s failure comes down upon them and forces them to pay attention to the moment. The failure, the guilt, is the key to unlocking shiskason. A pilgrim can enter shiskason for no other reason than he stopped and he sat and he did not walk the road.
It slows them down and gives the sun time to work delirium into them. At that point if they make a mistake with water, they’re dead, and it’s an easy mistake to make for any Solitants that come from across the northern sea. They don’t know what the sun can do to a body with just a few hours. When these foreigners come to the Bazul Road, all they hear is that its only a days journey. Just one day’s journey. Only twenty leagues. Sure, they hear stories about the deaths, but they shrug them off because stories are always exaggerated. Three water-skins should be enough. 
It’s hard to get experience traveling in the Sand, because getting experience means you’ve got to survive your mistakes. A weary pilgrim doesn’t noticed that he’s pricked a water-skin on the half-buried thorn of a karkel-bush seed pod, and that’s that, he’s in shiskason. And shiskason isn’t always a pleasant, bittersweet . If the heat takes you quick its not so bad, but if it doesn’t, if you’ve rationed water well enough to die slowly, then your mouth dries out and your tongue swells up and your eyes lose their moisture and start to scratch. Then a thumping nausea works its way out from your head and into your stomach and starts to gnaw at your bones so they start to ache. It’s no coincidence that almost every corpse found on a Charnel Road is found curled up like fetus against the agony, though not many corpses are found because a pack of lizards can eat a well-built human in less than a hand, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you might still be alive when they do it.</Text>

            <Title>Salt farm</Title>
            <Text>Two years ago, Mandrameen sold what little he owned and bought a farm ten leagues outside of Meskalim. Gil, he’d rescued from a leech farm. The poor old ox had been tied into a box that kept him still while the leeches fed on him. It was a horrible thing. There were two wooden bars under his legs to keep him standing up or else he’d have collapsed into the swamp from pain and exhaustion.
The two of them farmed legumes, mainly stipple beans, broad beans, and the like. Mandri would give the beans to a woman in Meskalim, who would then smash them up to make a variety of curds. She’d sell the little curd-bricks and crunchy curd-skins and would give Mandri a share of the profit. It was never enough to buy both burgeons and food, so Mandri went hungry. Gil ate grass.
Mandri had tried growing the burgeons himself, but his land wasn’t good for it. It wasn’t good for anything, really, because when he bought the place the dirt was already worn out. He didn’t know that at the time. The first few plantings were fine, but after that, any time a strong rain came it pulled salt up out of the ground. His field looked like a sweaty, salt-stained tunic that had been left to dry out in the sun.
The only thing that would grow was a solitary hornscrub tree. It grew right smack-dab in the middle of the field. The tree’s shade was the only place to laze the days away, and lazing there meant Mandri and Gil would have to look upon the dead earth and scattered stalks of failure. 
It was no matter, though. Peace of mind could be bought at the price of a burgeon.
Mandri found that if he mixed the burgeon’s nectar into a milky-white barley beer that he’d left steeping in a hole in the ground, well two mouthfuls of that and every worry melted away. 
He took two mouthfuls.
Then he sat in his favorite tree-nook and watched his mind as it slowly turned away from the shame of not being able to go back to Vigram’s. It was stupid of him to throw that away. How was he going to make money now? He’d probably have to sell himself to Geem.
But, ah, it was a beautiful sunny day. There was even a breeze, and the sound of a cool breeze sifting through the boughs of his hornscrub tree was one of his favorite sounds.
It’s not something that can be captured by a painting.
In truth, nothing can.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
Every. Single. One.
Mandri had traveled to every major city on the Jandri continent, so he’d seen them all. And the problem was always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see. When it comes to Nature, well, Nature is complex, and artists are people, and their stomachs are small, so they boil that complexity down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible lump of something which has got them transfixed—a flower, a nice pair of tits, a pretty face. Maybe it’d be a flower. What matters is that they try to preserve the things that make life worth living by ripping them out of the fabric of reality and stitching their hides to a frame. Then, after having captured and killed the sublime, they sell it. Some plucky merchant without a care buys it and mounts it onto his wall right next to the sprawling, headless hides of lizards.
Mandri burped, and took another swig. It was hard not to think about painting. Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d be forced to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf—its complexity, its pattern, its anastomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one—all that complexity, that beauty, reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if he had to paint the leaf, was to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. He might remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ bosom. And then he’d really done it, he’d not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, he’d erased it from existence entirely.
Maybe one can say that Mandri wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture Nature’s essence, but that hardly matters. “Go and try and paint Nature,” Mandri said to Gil as the beast napped away. “Take as long as you like. Take a lifetime. Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…”
And then he forgot what he was on about because hairs on Gil’s hide was starting to swirl. They only swirled a little bit. A more intense, boiling swirl was something that only happens when Mandri took black-eye burgeons, and only then if he crushed them up and let their juices dry out so he could smoke it.
Down-valley burgeon beer, the kind which he was drinking, does something entirely different. Things will swirl, edges will bleed, but only a little. The chief effect was that anything bright would sparkle—Gil’s white horns, the sunlight on the dusty earth, the puffs of cloud in the sky, pretty much everything that wasn’t hidden in shadow would sparkle. Most interestingly, the burgeonsight made it look like the salt stain on his field was squirming around. That was always a delight because it made it seem like he hadn’t lost a battle to an inanimate thing. The salt was alive, a flood of wriggling white mites gnawing at the few decaying stalks.
At least he’d managed to feed something.
He nestled deeper into his tree nook, and he sighed a little half-sipped, absent sigh, the kind of sigh that he’d start to make whenever he was ready for a nap. He let his eyelids slouch as he watched the flies buzz in and out of Gil’s snout. The ox would snore and blow those fuzzy black dots out of his great big nostrils, and then those flies would zip back in to lick at the only reliable source of moisture that they could find in this godforsaken field.
“Are you Mandrameen?”
Burgeon beer had never given Mandri extra inner voice before. Odd that it should sound like an old hag. It was an unwelcome development. He did not want to pursue it.  He wanted to sleep.
“Go away,” he said.
But it didn’t go away. It kicked him in the shin.
“Ow!”
The pain pricked Mandri’s mind back into the moment. He opened his eyes and was stunned to see an old hag wrapped in black standing there before him.
He’d heard of burgeonsight granting visions, but it had never happened to him. He tried to blink the old woman away, but she stubbornly remained. He picked up a little pebble and threw it at her. 
It hit her square on the nose.
“Ack!”
She wasn’t ready for it. Her arms flew up in a billow of robe, and she staggered back a step.
She was real.
Mandri’s first instinct was to drink as much of his jumped-up beer as he could, because no doubt this hag would try to steal it.
Then again, she might not know what it was. It looked like milk. And it would be a waste to drink it all in one go; it would knock him out, and what was the point of that? No, that wouldn’t do. This was a special drink. He’d made plenty of special drinks, but this one was extra special because it was right here, a thing of the present. He could maybe try to hide it, tuck the clay jug away somewhere, maybe just nudge it behind the tree, but no doubt that harpy’s eyes were—
“Something wrong with you, boy?” 
The woman’s voice was dire. She stared him down, and Mandri peered into the shadow of her blue-and-black shawl. He couldn’t find her eyes behind a nasty squint and a nose that was impossible to reason with. She wasn’t too old, just sun-leathered, and dammit she was tall. Too tall for an old woman. That was man’s air she was breathing.
“I’ll ask again, are you Mandrameen?”
She must be strong too, because her back bore a canvas sack that nearly doubled her size. And she hadn’t come adorned with the usual veneer of civilization; no shine-black bracelets, or bangles, or silver hoop earrings, no makeup or red-thread leaves trimming her robe. The only ornament she carried was a turtle-shell comb that she kept fashionably crooked in her waistband. The rest of her tawny self seemed slapped together in a reed hut on the banks of the Jek river. She was a feral thing, light on her feet, unwashed and yet somehow clean. And her teeth were somehow perfect; straight and sun-bleached. The burgeonsight made them sparkle. They practically outshone the sun.
She kicked his shin again.
“Ow!” Mandri moaned. “Dammit, yes, I’m Mandri.”
“Do you still have your testicles?” 
Her teeth flashed as she spoke.
“Excuse me?”
The old woman’s head pitched into a suspecting tilt. “Are you a eunuch? The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
Mandri shook his head in disbelief.
“Just because I don’t go in for the haggard women of Meskalim, that doesn’t make me a—what are you on about anyways?”
“Answer my question.”
“Of course I have my—Hold on, who are you?”
“You have your testicles, then?”
“Yes.”
“You’re not lying?”
“Did Ora send you?”
The woman unshouldered her heavy pack. It hit the ground with a dull thump, and this disturbed Gil, who raised his heavy head. The ox saw the woman, gave a snort, then promptly went back to sleep. 
Without asking if Mandri minded, the woman sat down upon her pack. She sat down right in front of Mandri’s feet. Then she pulled from her ragged robe a brown paper booklet. This booklet had no cover, and its makeshift spine was composed of peeling wax and fraying twine.
She laid the booklet flat on her lap and flipped through a few pages. There weren’t many of them. Mandri craned his neck to see if he could read what was there, but the burgeonsight made that impossible. Edges were starting to bleed together. If he drank too much more, things might get ___.
“So, you are Mandrameen,” the woman said as she flattened an unruly page with her palm.
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. This time he was more demanding.
“I am Pell,” she said.
“Go away, Pell.”
Pell smirked. She said, “I’m going to ask a few questions, and then I’ll be on my way.”
Mandri took another swig of his beer. He tried to reason out why this woman was here. By the looks of her, she didn’t have any money, so if it was about money, she was here to take it. If that little book of hers was a book of debts, well, Mandri would not be able to pay up.
“Where are you from, Pell?”
“I come from that which everything comes—the all-white spark.”
“Oh, you’re one of those.”
“And what is that?”
“You’re an itinerant priest.”
“Priestess,” Pell corrected.
“Right. Whatever.”
“I’m a priestess of Asharaheen.”
“I’ve never heard of Asharaheen.”
“Not many have. He is a—”
“I’m sorry,” said Mandri, interrupting. “I may have intimated there, that I want to hear about Asharaheen. I don’t.”
Pell gave a bemused sigh and flipped through her pages. “You’re drooling,” she said. 
Mandri wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Burgeons can make a mess of a person, but he wasn’t so far gone yet. A peculiar thing about this particular brew was that it left his wits untouched. Well, mostly untouched. Maybe a little touched. Toddler touched. Honestly, Mandri wasn’t sure. He knew it wasn’t safe to reason about reason when burgeons were involved.
Mandri said, “I’ve never seen a priestess without a pound of gold or silver rattling around her neck.”
“Me and mine are struggling at the moment.”
“Then your god must not be a very strong god.”
“Oh, Asharaheen is the weakest of all possible gods.”
“How is that?”
“Because he does not exist.”
“Oh. Well. Now I feel silly for asking. A priestess who follows a god that does not exist.”
“He will exist. He is going to—Ah, here you are. Mandrameen Andramawmun. That is your full name?”
Pell evidently had his name underlined his name with her finger.
Mandri nodded.
“You have a good name,” Pell said. “A strong Jandri name. An Old Jandri name. That’s good. And my notes say you started learning how to paint at the age of five. Is that right?”
Mandri’s eyes narrowed. If this woman was looking for an artist for some backwater temple icon, she’d come to the wrong place. Unless she had money.
“Do you have money?” he asked.
Pell either didn’t hear him, or pretended not to. She kept on reading from her book.
“My scribblings say you are a decent painter.”
She looked up to gauge Mandri’s reaction. This was some kind of challenge. He would not indulge her, though, high as he was, his face might be doing things all its own. That’s another thing about burgeons—it numbs the face but keeps it moving. he could be making kissy lips at her right now and he wouldn’t know it unless he focused.
“It says you have a…” Pell bent down to get a better look at the words. “It says you’ve have a triptych hanging in the garden of Zee.”
Mandri nodded. 
“It is hanging inside the garden?”
“Yes.”
“You couldn’t make it into the house?”
Mandri blanched at the insinuation. He said, “You’re a right old hag, aren’t you? You know what? You can leave. I don’t care if you’ve brought money, I’m not going to paint anything for you.”
“I’m not here to commission you.”
, he was a little sad that she wasn’t here for that.
“Whatever you’re here for, I don’t want it. Leave.”
Pell reached into her robe and pulled out a full silver string of little round coins. They sparkled magnificently.
“Would you like some money?”, she asked.
Mandri’s face must have been doing somersaults because the old woman was .
Pell said, “I will pay you to answer questions.”
“Questions about what?”
“Have you heard of the Prophecy of the Painted Eunuch?”
“No.”
“How about the Prophecy of the Eunuch Painter?”
“Hold on, I’ve already answered a question.” 
He held out his palm like a beggar.
Pell rolled her eyes and untied the silver string. She unthreaded a shining disc and tossed it.  
It wasn’t any kind of silver coin he’d ever seen. It wasn’t Hrkan, anyways.
He said, “What’s this all about, anyways? You’re looking for a eunuch painter? There’s a couple of them in Jeket.”
“I’m not necessarily looking for a eunuch. The prophecy was written in Old Jandri, and the word, ‘eunuch’, could be an inaccurate translation. I could be looking for an ‘impotent painter’, or, a ‘useless painter’. I would say that a painter who lives in such squalid conditions as you would qualify as useless. Wouldn’t you agree?”
Mandri held out his hand again and said, “Pay in advance.”
“Curb  your greed,” Pell said flatly. “I’ve plenty more questions to ask.”
She flipped to another page in her book. Then she flipped right back to where she’d been. 
“I might be skipping things I shouldn’t. Let me make sure…” She fingered a scribble, then read it aloud. “Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Answer the question, please. Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“Of course I have, who hasn’t?”
Mandri held out his hand again.
Pell waved it away and said, “But have you spoken the words yourself? I’m not talking about being a part of a prayer circle as a child, where someone else does the heavy lifting. Have you ever run away to a quiet place and whispered words to Solraheen?”
“Who hasn’t?”
“Have you?”
Mandri tried to remember how many questions that was.
He said, “One question at a time.”
Pell cocked her eye, frowned, and scribbled something into her book.
“What’s that you’re writing there?”
Pell looked at him.
“Can you read?” she asked.
“Of course I can read.”
“Then what does this say?”
She held the book open towards Mandri. It looked to him like there was nothing there.
“It doesn’t say anything.”
Pell tossed three more coins at him, and then she scribbled another secret something into her book.
“How many burgeons have you eaten?”
Mandri held out his greedy hand.
“I’m not paying for that question.”
“I haven’t eaten any.”
“So you’re a liar?”
“I am not.”
“Hah! You should see your eyes. But that’s good. It’s good.” She jotted down another note. “You’re fitting the mold, Mandrameen. Does that excite you?”
“Are you going to pay for that question?”
“Mandri, if the prospect of fulfilling a prophecy laid down at the dawn of time does not excite, then you’ve got a black spark. Tell me, how do you feel about power over all, eternal life, and infinite pleasure?”
She flicked a coin into his lap.
Mandri said, “Leave the others, but I’ll take the pleasure.”
“Have you ever killed someone before?”
“No.”
“How do you feel about killing people?”
“What has that got to do with painting?”
Pell didn’t answer. She didn’t scribble anything down, either. She stared at him expectantly, then a flash of annoyance her weathered features when she remembered she had to pay. She tossed another coin.
Mandri said, “Killing someone…it depends on the context, doesn’t it? The morality of something like that, it depends. Like, am I killing in self-defense? Are these, I don’t know, are they rapists?”
“You think that killing someone is a question of morality?”
“Isn’t it?”
“Let me rephrase: How do you feel about people?”
“How do I feel about people?”
The woman’s squint was getting severe. She asked, “You wouldn’t mind if everyone dropped dead?”
“Did I say that?”
“Stop answering my questions with a question.”
Mandri chuckled. “Look, everybody should be judged on their own merits…What is this prophecy anyways? I do something, and then a lot of people die?” 
“That’s generally how prophecies work—something happens, and a lot of people die.”
“But this prophecy, specifically, what happens?”
“In this prophecy, the painted eunuch—or the eunuch painter— will free Asharaheen so that He may roam the earth and heal this fractured world.”
“What does that have to do with people dying?”
“Mandri, people are dying all the time. Right this very moment. And I don’t mean one or two, a lot of people are dying right now. All Asharaheen is going to do is make sure that everyone is dying for a purpose.”
“And you need me to free him?”
“Someone like you will do it, yes.”
“Not me?”
“It might be you.”
Pause.
“Find someone else.”
Pell laughed. It was an grating laugh, half-cackle, half-.
She said, “That’s not how prophecies work, Mandri. I don’t pick someone to play the role. You are who you are, and if you are the one who is prophesied, then that is that, no one can change it.”
“If no one can change it, then what are you even doing out here, looking around for this ‘prophesied eunuch’? You find him, or you don’t find him, it’s all the same.”
Pell sat back on her bag and seemed to cherish the chance to talk about herself.
“Have you ever had a lover?” she asked.
“Yes.”
“Well, if you’ve ever had a lover, then you know what its like to wait for one.”
She looked up at the wistful dance of the hornscrub boughs.
She said, “I’ve been waiting for Asharaheen’s coming for a very long time. I’ve gotten impatient. I can think of nothing else but His arrival, so, I look out the window. That’s what I’m doing, in a manner of speaking, I’m here, looking out the window for a sign of His coming.”
Mandri scoffed at the thought of this old hag being the consort of anyone, much less a god. He shrugged to show his lack of concern and said, “Well, if I see him, I will let you know.”
“Please, do.”
At that, Pell closed her book and snuck it back into her robes.
She said, “Go into Meskalim and talk to Salavan Soreen.”
“Why?”
“That’s the only way to know for sure if you’re the one I’m looking for.”
Pell stood up. Mandri, thinking she was about to leave, leaned back into his tree-crook and whispered a chime of praise.
“Oh, I’m not leaving yet,” Pell said. “There’s one last thing—I haven’t eaten in ages.”
“I don’t have any food.”
“Yes you do.”
She bent down and gave Gil a pat.
Gil was awake now. His fat, bulging eyes were staring blankly off into the horizon.
“Gil’s not for eating,” Mandri said.
“Why not?”
“I’m not going to kill him just so you can nibble at his flank.”
“Its not his flank that I want.”
Mandri didn’t like her tone. There wasn’t a hint of jest in it.
“You can’t have any piece of him,” he said. “Gil isn’t for eating.”
“You named the ox, Gil?”
“I did.”
Gil mooed in recognition.
Mandri noticed her jingling her silver string and added, “And he’s not for sale either.”
Pell tucked the silver back into her robe, and then drew a long, golden knife from a hidden sheathe. Mandri startled to, but she got down to Gil’s neck before his limbs . She scraped her knife’s razor edge up and down against Gil’s throat. The poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, closed his eyes and lifted his chin to make sure Pell could scratch the whole length of it.
“Now that’s unnecessary,” Mandri said. “Let Gil be.”
“Why?”
“Because I said so.”
“All things die, Mandri. It’s near enough this ox’s time.”
“If you put one scratch on him, then I’m gong to balance and break your jaw on my knee.”
“You’d do that? You’d kill me to save your ox?”
“Without hesitation.”
Pell lowered her blade. 
“That’s good. That’s good.”
Mandri sprouted up to one knee and point to the road. “You need to leave,” he said.
Pell smiled, and said, “If you are the eunuch, then there’s an important lesson you need to learn. Better that it happens sooner than later.”
With an uncanny speed and cupped Gil’s snout under her arm and reached around his neck with her knife. She plunged her blade into the ox’s flesh. She’d done it tight up against his jaw and abruptly yanked it round to the other side.
Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and his whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head from Pell’s grasp. He stood up off his knobbly knees, knocked Pell on her ass, and then bolted off into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went.  
Mandri, frozen by the sudden shock of violence, watched on in horror as Gill came to a stop just ten yards away, realizing he had nowhere to go.
Gil stood there for a moment, head bowed, blood pouring into the earth, and then he looked back in confusion towards Mandri and Pell, looked back just in time to see his old master pick up a rock, snarl, and leap after the woman.
One sharp elbow into the uglies sent Mandrameen sprawling to the ground.
“So, you’re not a eunuch”, Pell said with an awful sneer.
Mandri muttered a curse. He got to his knees and reached out to grab Pell’s robe, but the cloth seemed to melt in between his fingers.
Pell jumped up to her feet as if lifted by an unseen wind.
And then… 
And then Mandri saw something he couldn’t believe.
Pell literally flew towards the wounded ox. She flew straight like an arrow flung from a bow. To Mandri’s burgeon-addled eyes she was nothing but a snarling head and billowing robe. For the briefest moment he saw her unshawled face in clean light:
Green eyes wild with excitement.
Brow arching resolute.
Fanged teeth flashing under an feral snarl.
Her long, smoky hair unfurled, and her shriek was borne not from her lungs, but the deepest depths of Shis.
She plunged head first into the Gil’s body and tore a hole into his belly as easily as if her nose were made of chipped obsidian. Gil crumpled to the ground, and Pell went with him, her head and shoulders fixed into his side.
Before Gil’s spine had the chance to spasm, Pell tore herself from his flesh. The neck of his first stomach was clenched in between her teeth. She spat it out, then ripped the rest of the innards from their lining and held the chain of stomachs up to the sun. Then her lips began to utter a speech as black as the dawn of night. 
Mandri clasped his ears, but he could not look away. He prepared himself for a final gross indignity. 
Instead, Pell’s chanting squeezed a bright point of light from Gil’s stomach, a light as bright as the sun, and she sipped it into her chest through pursed lips, as one might sip a too-hot tea.
Satiated, she dropped Gill’s innards onto the dirt. The tension in her shoulders disappeared.
Next thing Mandri knew, she standing above him. Her face was a withered sponge of blood. 
“Go and see Salavan Soreen,” she said. “I’ll be coming for your stomach if you don’t.”

Things worth painting - flower, maybe it’s their own damn face.


A severe slicked-back ponytail that had been plaited into the hair on the back of her head.

She’d been beautiful when she was young. Mandri had an for these things. That’s part of the reason why he found true beauty so impressive; he’d painted enough old faces to know what would happen. It was only a matter of time.  It was like food dropped on the ground.


MANDRI ARC
- Dont tell me who or what I am. I don’t even tell me who I am.
- You can’t run from your nature.
- no one is a master.



Smoky hair

Press the burgeons into the beer.

“Lets see your paintings then.”
“I don’t have any here.”
“A painter who doesn’t paint is bad at his job.”



Prophecy of the Painted Eunuch.
Painting is a sacred art.
Impotent artist. Inthe old Jandri its as ambiguos as it is in Common. Means you either can’t father children, or you’re a shitty artist.
I’m neither or those things, so its not me.
Seems like you might be a shitty artist. Else you wouldn’t be out here.
I’ll have you know I have a triptych hanging in the garden of eez.
IN the garden?
Yes.
COuldn’t even make it into the house?
Shut up you bitch.


 because being sober got in the way of enjoying the moment. Plus, getting high made everything move. That’s one feature of reality that’s noticeably absent from any painting - true movement.


If he were sober, he would have said something about standing at the edge of the wilderness, a place with a big sky and maybe mountains. Go there and suck on some black-valley burgeons to get in the mood, then let the shock of Nature’s overwhelming beauty hit the spinal cord. If the mood is right, it will hit with an intensity that no poet or painter could ever hope to achieve.
So, there was no point in trying.
It would be presumptuous.

STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
          by A. Nonymous


                                                               Nonymous / STANDARD FORMAT / 1

                                                 CHAPTER ONE
                                Folder Names Become Subtitles

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so that
work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to estimate
word count and determine roughly how many pages will be required to
produce a book using the page size, style and font used by their house.
This PDF file was generated using Scrivener's Compile feature and
was created using the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address
should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title page,
single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-caps about
half-way down the page. The author's name follows the title on the
by-line as the author wants it to appear when published. A real name
or pseudonym may be used and may include initials, actual given name
or professional designation.


                                                               Nonymous / STANDARD FORMAT / 2

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank line.
(It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with two spaces,
but in these days of word processors this is now less common.) A
12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or Arial should be
used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can write using any font
and formatting you choose--the &quot;Formatting&quot; pane of the Compile
dialog can be used to change the formatting in the compiled document.
In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the Compile settings will deal with
changing the font and formatting to those required for standard
manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be approximately
one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each page except for the
title page should include a header comprising the author's real
surname, the title of the work (or a key word from the title) in
capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled
in the &quot;Page Settings&quot; pane of the Compile dialog.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the typesetter.
The &quot;Separators&quot; pane of Scrivener's Compile dialog can handle this
for you if you are writing each scene as a separate text document.
         Indicate italics by underlining. In Scrivener, you can use


                                                               Nonymous / STANDARD FORMAT / 3

italics and set them to be converted to underlines upon export or
print by using &quot;Convert italics to underlines&quot; in the
&quot;Transformations&quot; pane of the Compile dialog.


                                                               Nonymous / STANDARD FORMAT / 4

                                                 CHAPTER TWO
                                       Another Chapter Folder

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the chapter
number about a third of the way down the page. In Scrivener, this
can all be dealt with in the Compile settings. The &quot;Separators&quot; pane
of the Compile dialog can be set to start a new page for each chapter
folder, and the &quot;Formatting&quot; pane can be used to add page padding
at the top of the new page and insert the chapter number (the latter
by selecting &quot;Section Layout...&quot;). All of this has already been done
for you in the &quot;Standard Manuscript Format&quot; compile preset, used by
default for the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you can
insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft


                                                               Nonymous / STANDARD FORMAT / 5

Word Count. (In the &quot;Novel&quot; template, where the Draft folder has been
renamed &quot;Manuscript&quot;, this menu option will also be renamed
&quot;Manuscript Word Count&quot;.) For a full-length novel, you may wish to
choose &quot;Rounded to Nearest 100&quot;, as on the title page of this
manuscript, or &quot;Rounded to Nearest 1000&quot;. Note that the actual word
count will not be inserted, but a tag that will be replaced by the
word count upon export.

         In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are often
less picky about format and will point you in the right direction
before submitting your work to a publisher.

            <Title>Pyetle's Field</Title>
            <Text>Figure out how to work in the blackshells to the west.
Blood thick in pyetles hand.

The Great Soldgi Erg is a sea of sand that scours the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent, and people who grow up within sight of it grow up with the story of how those dunes came to be. Every time the story is told some details are added, some forgotten, and sometimes even the heart of it will change. The only thing that everyone agrees upon is that a god named Sol made those mountains of sand a long time ago, back when he walked the earth alone, and that is why it is called the Great Soldgi Erg. 
That’s was what was on Pyetle’s mind as he and the scribe Soreel lounged in his field, drinking his brew. When he asked Soreel if she believed the story about how the Erg was made, she could only scratch her head and ask, “Which story do you mean?” 
She gave a little half-sipped, absent sigh as she said it, the kind of sigh that you give when someone drunker-than-you starts to feel like they’re making sense of things. Soreel wanted to laze the day away in silence, wanted to drink Pyetle’s brew in silence, wanted to enjoy the cool Istil wind from the shade of a fat cedar tree in silence. She wanted to keep to her plan: waste time out in Pyetle’s field until the sun started to set, and then she would do what she came here to do.
She couldn’t drink too much because it was past midday and if she fell asleep she might not wake up until night. Already she could feel her head swirling and her eyelids slouching, intent on doing as little work as she was. The sun bearing down on the barren field all around wasn’t helping things. The glare was so bright that she could naught but squint, and that was near enough to having them closed that her buzzing brain had trouble marking the difference.
There wasn’t anything to look at either. Pyetle’s farm was twelve thousand square metres of wasteland. There was once a time when it boasted a harvest of legumes - soy, redbean and the like - but when salt started to show on the surface Pyetle was forced to plant barley. Nowadays the land was so salt-ridden that it looked like a sweat-stained shirt, and the only thing that would grow for miles around was the cedar tree under which they sat. The only thing that moved were the flies that buzzed around the ox’s ringed snout. Soreel distracted herself from sleep by watching them as the ox would snore and blow them out of his nose, and then they would fly back in to lick at the only source of moisture they could find amidst this desolation.
“I’m talking about the story that says it was all an accident,” Pyetle said. “That’s the story I like.”
Soreel stifled a groan and humored Pyetle by looking towards where he was pointing. There the distant southern horizon was rimmed by a hazy red blur of mounding sand; the Great Soldgi Erg.
“It’s the first story about Solraheen I can remember. I must have been about… I don’t know… four when I first heard it.”
“That would be why,” Soreel muttered.
“What’s that?”
“That’s why I haven’t heard it. If you heard it when you were four. That was a long time ago. By the time I got around to being me I bet that story had been forgotten.”
“No it hasn’t.”
“Clearly.”
Pyetle smiled. He had a gummy smile which cradled a few precious teeth. Soreel knew he wasn’t as old as he looked because he looked as old as the gnarled tree against which he sat. He was only fifty-two, but with how lined and leathered his skin was, how white his scraggled beard, he seemed seventy, or even eighty. His color was just like a Jandri slave’s - dark and dirty umber everywhere but the top of his bald olive head which had been spared from the sun by his straw hat.
Soreel hated how Pyetle was always smiling. He always smiled when he was drunk. He was a lively drunk. In fact the drunker he got the more intelligible he got because when he was sober he mumbled. There was always a point where he’d have too much and the spittle would start to run down his chin but he rarely ever got there. He was old and skinny but he could hold his drink.
He could feel Soreel looking at him. 
He asked her,“ Do you want to know how the story goes?”
 “No, not really.”
“Well the story goes that Sol wanted to build a garden to cover all the land.”
Soreel closed her eyes.
“Don’t interrupt me when I’m telling it,” Pyetle said.
Pyetle took another swig of his beer, and then he continued on.
“Solraheen planted a stick in the ground just south of here to mark one of the garden’s six corners.” Pyetle pointed towards the Soldgi Erg. “He then left to Sol-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. Well, that stake in the ground, that was the accident.”
Soreel looked and saw the Pyetle had a twig in his hand. He was poking it into hard, dry earth next to his hip.
“Sol planted that stake in the ground and then he left. Then in a few days a little…*hic*… a little embryo of a sand dune built up in that stick’s lee.”
Pyetle built up a little hump of dirt to the side of his own stick to demonstrate. Soreel wasn’t watching but Pyetle didn’t notice.
 “See it was all by accident. By accident Sol happened to put his stick in just the right spot, and it was left alone for just long enough, that the wind built that little hump of sand higher and higher. It grew wide and tall and in no time at all the first sand dune was born.”
At that he rubbed out his own little fledgling dune.
“By accident?” Soreel asked.
“An accident. Sure. Why not? You can’t tell me that Solraheen meant to turn good black earth into a mountain of sand. And that’s what happened. While Sol was off wandering in the middle of Sol-knows-where, shaping rivers, mountains, and fields and whatnot, that little dune got large enough to sustain itself. Large enough to not be blown away by the first squall or rainstorm. Then years passed and the Istil wind… or one of the winds stretched that dune south and east all the way to the southern tip of Corin.”
“What about all the other dunes?”
“Ah, see, that first dune grew tall, so tall that it rippled the wind and created a kind of nursery for neat little rows of dunes behind it. Those littler dunes would grow and grow. Soon they covered the land in all directions. And so them dunes over there came to be. The Great Soldgi Erg.”
“I don’t think that’s how it happened.”
“So you don’t believe it?”
“Hard to believe.”
“You could say it gets harder. Because we have to say that Solraheen not only made a mistake, but he gave up. See the earth over there was once spongy and black. It was good earth. Not like this salty shit that I’ve got. Then the good lord stuck his stick in the ground and then - boom - sand. Cleaning it all up was such a task that He just up and left. Decided not to do it. He gave up.”
“That’s not what happened.”
“Oh? Were you there?”
“Solraheen knows the winds. He knows the appetite of the sand. He made them. Everyone knows that he pulled the Erg up from the earth. The Soldgi Erg is the garden.”
Pyetle spat a little spittle onto the ground. The earth was so dry and caked by the sun, as hard as fired clay, that the spit just lingered there on the surface. 
“You sound just like one of Sol’s itinerants,” he said. He then stood up and assumed a pose in mock imitation of those traveling preachers. He kept his chin up, kept his  back stiff as a board, and then stretched his hand out to the heavens. He began to preach in kind, voice inflected with grandeur as if addressing an unbeliever.
“See how Solraheen’s golden light shimmers across Sand. A sweet smelling rose or a pink-petaled poppy would only blemish such beauty.”
He then took another swig of his beer. He tilted his head back to let thick brew run clean down his throat. He tilted a little too far back and so he stumbled. In that half-time grace where the body notices things just a hair too late. But he caught himself before he fell down. He wiped his lips with his arm as he finished, then nearly spat on Soreel as he charged what he thought was her ignorance.
“Have you ever actually been down to the Erg? Climbed one of the dunes? I doubt you could even do it. Aside from the sand-spitting wind that rakes the skin and opens sores, the view is nothing special. ‘Ooooh, a big pile of sand! How wonderful! Praise the maker!’I mean see it once, sure, but really the best thing about anywhere in the Sand is the sky. And the sky is… the sky. Its everywhere. Don’t need to spend three fingers climbing a dune to see it.”
“Why do you care?”
“Why do I care?”
“I know you’re trying to make some point. I’d rather you be out with it instead of spitting every where.”
“The point, girl, is that even Sol messed up and made a mess of things, so you can hardly blame me for what I’ve done.”
Soreel laughed. “Pyetle, Pyetle, Pyetle, Pyetle.” Each time she repeated the name pyetle felt more cornered.
“Salvan does not care for excuses.”
“Not an excuse.”
“I’m not here to hear you out, Pyetle. I’m here to take you back with me.”
“I know.”
Soreel brushed off her sleeves and made a show of standing up. She stretched like she’d never done it before. Her little stir woke up the ox and he mooed in irritation. She said, “I suppose if we head out now it will be dark when we get back.”
“I’m not going,” Pyetle said.
“You don’t have a choice.”
“You going to carry me all the way back to Shagota?”
Soreel’s shoulders slumped as she realized Pyetle was intent on making this as difficult as possible for her. She was always stuck with the shit-end jobs.
“Pyetle, please. Just come with me. I’ll strap you to the ox if need be.”
“That’s my ox. I’m staying. Gil stays.”
“You named the ox Gil?”
“I did.”
Gil mooed in recognition.
“Well Gil isn’t yours anymore.”
“What?”
“Pyetle, three months ago you were sixty-two thousand fingers in debt. Then you bought poor Gil here. Now you’re sixty-four thousand fingers in debt.”
“Nonsense.”
“Did you even use him for anything?”
“Gil kept me company.”
“You bought an ox for company?”
“I did and he’s not for sale.”
“He’s not yours to sell! Your field, your ox, you yourself, you’ve all already been bought.”
“The city owns my debt.”
“Pyetle. You know how this works. You’re Salavan’s now.” Soreel exclaimed. She knew Pyetle knew exactly who. Pyetle’s grim expression.
 Pyetle said as he sat back down into his little nook in the tree. His nonchalance further irritated Soreel out of her wits. Her face was stuck in this blank expression, thin lipped and squint-eyed, churning . Then the corners of mouth twisted into a wry smile.
“They sold it to Salavan,” she said. She took pleasure in the way the name made Pyetle squirm to attention.
“They can’t do that.”
“You are sixty-four-thousand fingers in debt. You’re old. Your field is done. It’s not worth the time it takes to walk across it. But what’s got the scribblers really worried is that you have no kids so there is no one else they can pin the debt on. If you die it becomes their problem, and since Salavan was willing to pay it off in return for you and everything you’ve got, they took it.”
Pyetle burped. 
Soreel did her best to ignore Pyetle’s outburst and started to pull on Gil’s nose ring to get him to stand up. The ox didn’t budge.
“We’re not going,” Pyetle said.
“You are.”
“I feel like it should be obvious that Gil and I are quite content to sit here and die.”
Makes a greater show of trying to get the ox up, but its too much effort. (so the strat of having the ox carry pyetle).
With a huff Soreel let go of Gil’s ring and then she spat on him. Gil just blinked. The flies rushed out of Gil’s nose to chase the bit of spittle that had landed on his snout. Soreel grimaced, then put a hand on her hip and waved a finger in faces of these wasted souls.
“Look. You two are going to spend what few years you have left as Salavan’s slaves. Salavan wants a stela made and Pyetle, you’re going to carve it. Gil’s going to work the wheel. I mean honestly, thats what you should have been doing for the past twenty years.”
While she was talking, Pyetle had begun to shake his head, and like a toddler he just kept going, shaking is his head, saying ‘nope…nope…nope…’under his breath.
Soreel laughed the laugh of the offended before letting Pyetle in on how things really were.
“He can have the land.” Pyetle
“Salavan doesn’t care about this shit. Doesn’t care about the ox, either. He wants you, Pytele.”
“I said you wouldn’t come but he insisted that I should come and get you anyways. So here I am, insisting.”
Pyetle heard the draw of a blade and thens aw that Soreel had a long-knife held right up against Gil’s neck. She started to scrape it up and down against Gil’s throat, and the poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, had his eyes closed and tilted his head up to make sure Soreel could scratch the whole length of it.
“Now that’s unnecessary,” Pyetle said. “Let Gil be.”
“You’ll come then?”
“No.”
“Then I’m going to offer Gil up to Solraheen.”
“Now hold on!” Pyetle shouted. Soreel stayed her hand.
“Why do you care if I go or not?”
Soreel lowered her blade and looked at Pyetle throught
“Because I don’t get paid if I don’t do my job, and right now my job is getting you to Salavan.”
“Just let it go, my gods. Walk away and Gil and I will walk the other.”
“Did you not hear what I just said? I don’t get paid if you don’t show up in Salavan’s house.”
“I’m not going.”
“Then I kill the ox.”
“Leave Gil be. Kill me, I don’t care.”
“Don’t be ridiculous.”
“Let Gil go.”
“Are you going to come with me?”
“No.”
“I don’t want to kill the ox, but you’re going to be seeing a lot of me so its best you understand that I’m a woman of my word.”
Soreel shrugged, then cupped Gil’s snout under one arm and reached around his neck with her other. Pyetle watched in horror as she plunged her blade into his ox’s flesh. She’d done it tight up against his jaw and then immediately started to pull the blade round to the other side, but before she’d gotten halfway Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and then his  whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head out from her grasp. He leapt to his feet, knocked Soreel on her ass, and then bolted off into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went. 
He only got thirty meters or so when he started to slow. Then he stopped altogether. It was as if he looked out into the distance and realized he had nowhere to go. He stood there for a moment, head bowed and blood pouring down into the earth, and then he looked back in confusion towards Pyetle and Soreel, looked back just in time to see his old master smashing in the side of Soreel’s skull with a five pound rock. 
The woman crumpled to the ground.
Pyetle had never killed anyone before. He was shocked at how easy her skull had caved in. She lay there, eyes open but motionless. 
Pyetle reached down and picked up the her knife, then marched over to where Gil was still standing. 
By now Gil’s cries of pain and terror had ceased. Spittle ran thick and red from his mouth, and his chest heaved with every labored breath.
Pyetle sidled up to him, calming hand outstretched. Gil let him come, and 
“Don’t worry Gil. I’ve got you.”
With a quick jerk Pyetle finished Soreel’s cut, and Gil collapsed in kind. In a few more moments he was well and truly dead.
Pyetle looked at the bloody blade in his hand. It was iron, long and skinny, and it’s hilt was brownwood patterned with innumerable dots of tin. If it could kill an ox, it could kill Salavan Saran.
Then he set off to see his new master.

            <Text>The androgyne
Woman called maesia, successfully defended herself in the courts and ‘because she really had a man’s nature behind the appearance of a woman was called ‘the androgyne’.
Afrania, used to initiate legal cases herself and was impudent enough to plead in person, so that everyone became tired out with her ‘barking’ or ‘yapping’. ‘With unnatural freaks like this its more important to recordwhen they died than when they were born.
Women were allowed to speak ouut as victims and as martyrs, usually to preface their own death.
Lucretia, raped by a brutal prince, ws given a speaking part solely to denounce the rapist and announce her own suicide.
Rip out hte womans tongue.
Hortensia speaks out for the women of rome, and women only.

2nd century guru - “a woman should as modestly guard against exposing her voice to outsiders as she would guard against stripping off her clothes.”

As we saw with telemachus, to become a man was to claim the right to speak. Public speech was a - if not the - defining attribute of maleness. 
A woman speaking in public was, in most circumstances, by definition not a woman.

Entirely surrounded by men - and pikes.

For centuries the public speech of women has been niched into talking about women.

Complaining about ‘thin nasal tones’ of women public speech, about their ‘twangs, whiffles, snuffles, whines and whinnies’. 

A gobby woman.

Aristophanes comedy ‘lysistrata’ - A sex strike by the women of  athens to force their husbands to end the long-running war with sparta. The men go round for most the play with enormously inconvenient erections.  Eventually the men give in. 

Eons of erosion from these mountains have resulted in the valley fill on which these arizona upland flourishes. Recent reosion is visible today in the form of alluvial fans at the bases of the mountains. The combination of rain and mountain topography creates washes that form riparian corridors dissecting our desert landscape, recharging our aquifers, and bringing green ribbons of life through an otherwise arid landscape.

Mountains a buffer to plants and animals needing to escape the dry desert heat of the low basins and valleys.

Sky island ranges provided a climatic gradient for plants and animals to move through during times of changing climates, droughts, and glacial interglacial cycles.

Often in masses of water-laden air called gulf surges that rush right up the middle of the sea of cortez to dump theiri harvested moisture in the southern arizona. (‘harvest moisture’ causing aridity)


Winter
Fruints of netleaf hackberry trees are ripening, providing food. Shrubs sprout bright new leaves, many trees such as mesquites, palo verdes, and sycamores will drop leaves as temps below freezing.

Birs in the mimc thrush begin to establish mating territories. They ‘map’ territories by singing their famous copycat songs from teh tops of trees, poles, or fences. 

Glossy black-crested birds with white wing patches. Fluttery flight displays to attract femals. Mule deer breeding season, called the ‘rut’. Viliont sparring with antlers.

Mountain lions feed well this month in the mountain foothills, where distracted male deer make easier prey.

Gold poppies, lupines, and silver bells. Alders bloom before sending out new leaves.

March is wildflower month. Globemallows, penstemons, evening primroses, desert marigolds, gilias, bladderpods, dock, chia, desert hyacinths, and many more. Shrubs broom as well, including desert lavender,hopbush, brittlebush, fairy duster, and mormon tea.

Elf owls arrive from wintering grounds in mexico to breedin nthe desert; males arrive first and try to win females with their distinctive barking call as they purch in cavities in saguaro cacit or trees. 

Songbirds rest in riparian corridors.

Iron cross blister beetles

Summer rains trigger a second breeding season for many animals, including insects and the birds and mammals that feed on them. Many butterfiles emerge or arrive with the rains. Monarchs, sulphurs, queens, fritillaries, and swallowtails.  Palo verde beetles that feed on the roots of their namesake plants emerge to mate and lay eggs. Amphibians such as spadefoots and shihuahuan green toads begin their short and frenzied reproductive cycles in the shallow rain puddles. Red spotted toads in semipermanent waters.  Nectar-feeding bats and thei new young move south, following the blooms of agaves along the mountain spines.  Swirling  swarms of wingedleaf-cutter and harvester ants in the morning after heavy rain; these are new queens and males that will mate and establish new colonies.

Sol - Sohwl - Sohen - Sun
Mun - Mohnur - Monu  - Moon

“I knew I was a child of Moon when I would sleep during the day. My natural cycle.”

- Sol / Mun - personified - words ‘Sun/Moon’ stem from orthodox Drekk belief that Sun - lord of day - moon - lord of night.

Sohn and Mohnu co-exist in the same form. Only one is ‘active’ at a time. They are immortal, but can die. Upon death, the active deity switches from light - dark and vice-versa. 
The Battle of Light against Dark is the eternal conflict. Sun, when active, will try to set up earthly structures to thwart the the doings of Moon, should the day come when Sun is killed and Moon takes over. 
For the people, which one is ‘good’ is dependent upon which one you believe.
Humans are incapable of determining right course of action in this context - Invincible ignorance.
Iram has been an acolyte of both for eons. Grew tired of the grind and just trapped them under a continental shelf.

Mazyd Oro sees what is going on under the hood however, and decides that, for the betterment of humanity, the light/dark/ dichotomy must be destroyed.
	“YOU can’t kill me! Sooner destroy the sun. I sustain life.”
Under the hood:  
Nohuk was first - wandered the world in solitude. Came to understand that his body was a trap of the divine essence. After an eon of wandering and investigation, he discovered the material world was the product of a ‘rusting’ process of the divine spark. So, he spent all his days trying to seal the gap that allowed the divine to materialize and corrupt, and once he thought his job was completed, he decided to end his own life in an attempt to return to the spark. So, he slit his wrist and bled into the shandra river, which is now the home to the helamites. 
But instead of decaying, his body was moments later assumed by Lohuk. Lohuk, having no knowledge of Nohuk, only the imitible footprints in the mud next to him, spent another eon searching for a companion. Lohuk was stunned by the natural beauty of the world, and had an internal compulsion to share the experience. His body had a natural attunement to the demiurge, which Nohuk cultivated, and so he created for himself a wife, shelati - a pure vessel for the divine spark. From them came children. From them came the human race. 
But Lohuk’s family was not, like himself, immortal. Over time it splintered into tribes. Lohuk could not keep them together. Lohuk could not be defeated in battle - instead, he was assassinated.
Then Nohuk rose with the body. At first confusion at being put back, and then at seeing so many creatures around him that were in his image. Seeing a statue of himself, he quickly reasoned what was happening, that he had not been in control of his own body.

imbibing the host essence, he killed himself to release the spark.

Mandri to other:  Word for Light comes from Lohuk. Word for night comes from Nohuk. 
“But that could just be because Lohuk was present more recently than Nohuk.”</Text>

Humans shaping the environment.
Delayed return.
Fynbos (fine bush) in south africa. Included among the plants o fthe fynbos is a flower called watsonia, a member of the lily family. Like its relative the gladiolus, it has a sizable corm, or bubl, which in the case of watsonia is edible. When fynbos vegetation is deliberatly burned off, watsonia grows back with its density per acre increased five to ten times. It seems the occupants of the region had disocvered this fact.

Fish - heads removed and bodies smoked and dried to be eaten later.

Dense mats of sedge called purple nut grass were exposed. The sedge mats were ten feet wide, and every ten-square-foot section could produce an incredible 21k tubers. 
The plant collectors at wadi kubbaniya had learned that during october and november the nut grass tubers were small and tender; by february and march they had grown larer and harder and were filled with bitter alkaloids. Even these mature tubers, however, could be rendered edible by grinding them on stones and roasting them. 

Drying soking grinding rooasting and storing - stretch temporary abundance into months of food.

The houses at mezhirich were unlike anything seen previously. The structures were probably framed with birch or willow poles and roofed with mammoth hide, non of which has been preserved. What survived were the walls built of mammoth bones stacked to the roof. Dewlling 1 was made from 95 lower jaws of mammoths, laid chin down using a herringbone pattern. The building of dwelling 4 alternated layers of chin-up and chin-down mandibles.
Hunters used mammoth tusk ivory to make figurines, pendants, bracelets, and scrimshawed plaques. Most remarkable, however, was monumental work of art found in dwelling 1. Here, someone had propped up a mammoth skull and painted its forehead with dots, parallel lines, and branching designs in red ocher. 
Dwelling for blood magic.

Some of their chipped stone was quartz crystal, beads of amber, beats of fossil marine shell. 

Although one is born into a family, one must be initiated into a clan. That initiation requires rituals during which clan secrets are revealed to initiates, and they undergo an ordeal of some kind,

Rosseau felt that to understnd the origins of inequality, one had to go back to a long-ago time when nature providded all human needs, and the only differences among individuals lay in their strength agility, and intelligence. People had both ‘anarchic freedom’ (no government or law) and ‘personal freedonm’ (no sovereign master or immediate superior). Individuals of that time, which rousseau called the ‘state of nature’, displayed self-respect but eschewed self-love. 
Most anthropologists do not like the phrase ‘state of nature’. They do not believe in a time when archaic modern humans had so little culture that their behavior was directed largely by nature. 

Some 4,000 years ago, foreshadowed later eskimo culture. The people using these small tools kept warm in semi-subterranean houses with the tunnel entrances, essentially a sod-covered version of the later igloo.

The netsilik eskimo of the central canadian arctic believed that earth had always existed. During mythological time, however, humans lived in perpetual darkness like that of hte arctic winter - no sunlight, no animals, and no pleasure o r suffering existed. Then nuliajuk, an orphan girl pushed from a kaya, sank to the ocean bottom and became mistress of the sea. She then create all animals, all hard work, and all pleasure.
During this primordial era, both humans and animals could speak, and there was little difference between them. Finally the arctic hare cried out for ‘day’, and there was light; but day was forced to alternate with night, because the nocturnal arctic fox cried out for ‘darkness’. 
At first there were no netsilik, only the tunrit, or ‘old ones’, superhuman beings who rendered the land uninhabitable. The tunrit left when the netsiliik arrived, but not before they had invented the leister for spearing fish, the long stone walls for driving caribou on foot, the weir for fishing, and the craft of hunting caribou from cayaks. 
In the cosmology of the netsilik, a gradual process of differentiation created deities, humans, and animals out of porimordial chaos. Pleasure and suffering were established to give life meaning. With the crystallization of the visible world came the establishment of moral order, a series of prohibitions to control wickedness and promote restraint.
Because humans and animals had breath, they could interact with the spirit of the air, giving htem more power than plants or rocks. The difference between humans and animals was that humans had names; ones name was so magical that it made oe superior to a caribou or seal. 
Like many foraging societies, the eskimo believed that humans would be reincarnated. They were stoic in the face of death because they saw it as a recycling of the sould from one body to another. An occasional elderly eskimo, tired of the struggle against hunger and cold, took his or her own life, confident  of returning as a newborn. So strong was this belief that babies might be given the name of a deceased elder, or even referred to as grandmother or grandfather.
Eskimos loved children, but in a land where starvation was endemic, their belief in reincarnation made infanticide a pragmatic decision in a time of stress. When a family knew that it could not aford another mouth to feed, it might simply leave a newborn outside to freeze - in effect, saying to its spirit, ‘please come back later; this is not a good time.’ This act was performed before the infant had been named, so that the recycled spirit within it would not be insulted; indeed, without the magic of a name, the tiny creature was not yet human. 


During famins, all food was shared with neighbors . After a successful hunt, the actual slayer of each caribou was identified by the markings on his arrow. The meat was then divided by rule, with the slayer receiving the forntal portion and his hunting companions the rest. 
Socrucial was food sharing that the eskimo used ridicule to prevent hoarding and greed. 
Use long fences of boulders to divert the caribou toward the bowmen. 

Netsilik hunters shared meat of seal 12-ways to strengthen social obnds. Can become hereditary. When two adult hunters became habitual partners, they often arranged for tehir sons to be future partners. If one partner were to die, he could be replaced by someone with the same personal name. This act followed logically from the premise that any two people who shared the same name were magically linked.
This meat sharing relationship formed allliances

A ring of postholes suggests that the hut had a conical roof, made of branches and daubed with clay to protect the occupants from wind and snow. 

The bedrock was pitted with sinkholes and became watering places, crucial landmarks in a world with only ten inches of rain. Broadlief trees. Sand dunes supported ricinodendron trees whose nuts supplied the kung people with half their plant food. Areas of hardpan supported commiphora plants, the preferred food of the beetles whose pupae the kung converted into poison for their arrows.
Called the magic n/um.

Use humor to prevent feelings of superiority.
A hunter asking for help in hauling a magnificent kill to his camp would be told, ‘you think this skinny bag of bones is worth carrying?”

If one wants to be well thought of, he will be generious. If he strays from this ideal, he will be reminded of it with humor. If he persists in not sharing - he will be actively disliked.

It was not the intrinsic value of the gift that mattered. The real value of hxaro was that it created a network of partners, often living up to 50 miles away, whose camps one could visit in times of scarcity. Whole families coudl visit other camps for up to half a year, sharing food and water, after which the visitors were allowed to build their own shelter. —— ShaRing of limited resources - the humanity.

We wonder if clanless hunters, forbidden by society from accumulating surplus food, may instead have been accumulating social obligations. Their allged altruism, in other words, could be seen as a self-serving investment, a way of obligating their guests to host htem in the future when their situations were reversed.
A hunter is not allowed to shame his partners with gifts so large that they could not be matched. Later societies with clans will use lavish gifts to create the impression of inequality.

First born childrend were often named for a grandparent of the same sex. So magic were names that if an unrelated person received the same name as someone’s sibling, that person would be treated as if he or she were that sibling.  

Having no unit larger than an extended family allowed for great flexibility. As resources waxed and waned, camps could move and families coudl aggregate or disperse as needed.
But when times were tough, need to seek hospitality of unrelated neighbors. Uhaving no kin group larger than the extended family was a disadvantage. 
So they had extensive networks of honorary kinsmen. Later, agri societies turn gifts and magic names into sources of inequality.
When the fruits of the cordia and slavadora bushes becam ripe, families converged on these groves and lived in larger camps. 
‘Camps’ not clans as the meaningful social unit.
Dry season camps tended to be larger because this was the season of big game, and everyone wanted to live near the most skilled hunters.
Hadza moved camp to be near recently killed game, to abandon a camp where someone had died; to obtain wood for arrow shafts, trade, etc.

During the summer rains they might occupy rock shelters. In the dry season they lived outdoors in ephemeral huts or windbreaks. Their most substantial camps lay usually within a mile of water.
None of the quadrants of their world were considered exclusive territories. Anyone could hunt, collect wild plants or draw water. 

Marriage as two men two women. On man two women. 
With the creation of clans, an us vs. Them mentality. Murder was removed from individual matter, to a move agains the entire clan, that demanded a group response.
Enter social substitutability -clan b can kill anyone from clan a, even women or children who were innocent of the origial murder.

This was an area where, as at wadi kubbaniya, foragers relied heavily on seasonally flooded embayents, places where catfish and tilapia  gathered and dense mats of purple nut grass grew. 

Jarawa were ambushed so often that, though they usually went around naked, they took to wearing bark armor to ward off arrows.

One is not simply born aranda or aranban or murngin; it takes years of effort to become a full member of one’s group.

While many tribes had enemies for neighbors, there was one person who could travel widely without fear of death: the sacred messenger. The messenger might, for example, be carrying the red-painted forearm bone of a deceased relative,. Owing to his sacred mission, the meessenger could not be harmed. 

Aborigines did not believe there was such a thing as inevitable natural death. Death resulted either from homicide or witchcraft.

Breath is the difference between life and death. The wind is breath.  Sacred.

Roy rappaport - religion. Argues that all religion consists of three components. First are the ultimate sacred propositions, beliefs considered irrefutable despite the fact that there is no empirical evidence to support them. These propositions direct the second component, ritual, which must be performed repeatedly and correctly in order to achieve its goals. If done correctly, ritual induces the third component, an awe-inspiring experience.  Because this experience deeply stirs the emotions, it verifies teh sacred propositions in a way that cold, hard logic never could. 
Ritual is the key component of this self-validating system.  Paraphernalia, costume, pigments, and musical instruments, performed over and over again.

Chimps - dominance hierarchy.
Chimps cannot do what human foragers do: accumulate social obligations with their neighbors as a hedge against lean times.
The headmen of foraging groups were not bullies. They were generous modest and diplomatic, because their constituents were too skilled at alliance building to put up with bullies. The fat e of the bully was to lure them into a bush and pincushion them with arrows.
KEY: early humans considered themselves as part of a natural/supernatural dominance hierarchy, where humans could be nothing more than a ‘gamma’. Celestial alphas were the source of the ultimate sacred proposition. Ancestors were beta, and the focus of ritual. Emotions of living gammas was where the awe happens. 

Several of the world’s great monotheistic religions preserve, largely unaltered, the ultimate sacred propositions of aramaic speaking societies that lived too long ago. 

Ritual subincision.

Examples of overkill were frequent. A middle-aged man, Burial 21, had been hit with 19 flints; projectiles were found in the top of his pelvis, his forearm, his lower leg, his rib cage, and the base of his neck. One young woman, Burial 44, had been hit with 21 flints; three of these were probably the barbs of a spear that penetrated her face and reached the base of her skull. Nor were children spared. Two youngsters interred together, Burials 13 and 14, had flints in their neck vertebrae, each probably representing a coup de grâce.

Wendorf agrees with Kelly and suspects that two factors led to a history of ambushes at Jebel Sahaba. First, the Nile embayments of that era would have been rich but circumscribed environments, surrounded by desert. Second, there were several groups of people competing for the fish and nut grass of each embayment, apparently ready to defend them with violence if necessary.
Ambushes of this kind are too small-scale to be considered war, but they can be nasty, and once begun they can turn into blood feuds that can last for years. While blood feuds tend to arise with clans, there are exceptions to this rule of thumb. In areas of rich resources like those of the tropical Andaman Islands, described later, even clanless foragers could “afford to make enemies of their neighbors,” as Kelly puts it. In the case of Jebel Sahaba, however, we believe that we are dealing with societies with clans. One reason is that the site was a cemetery.

Because the Aka-Bea and Jarawa spoke different dialects, it was difficult for them to hold peacemaking ceremonies. In areas where there was no such language barrier, the Islanders did negotiate truces. Any man who had killed an enemy took to the jungle for months of ritual purification; in his absence, the women of both groups arranged for the other men to dance and hunt together, ending hostilities for a time.

Wild yams and other tubers were there to be dug up with sticks, and there were pools of standing water with ducks, pelicans, spoonbills, and ibis. The Aborigines used oval shelters called wurleys and ephemeral lean-tos called mia-mia. Night found them sleeping in scooped-out hollows, sometimes covered with a kangaroo hide. Day might find them cooking sedge bulbs in hot ashes, like the foragers of Wadi Kubbaniya.

  1. Generosity is admirable; selfishness is reprehensible.
  2. The social relationship created by a gift is more valuable than the gift itself.
  3. All gifts should be reciprocated; however, a reasonable delay before reciprocating is acceptable.
  4. Names are magic and should not be casually assigned.
  5. Since all humans are reincarnated, ancestors’ names should be treated with particular respect.
  6. Homicide is unacceptable. A killer’s relatives should either execute him or pay reparations to the victim’s family.
  7. Do not commit incest; get your spouse from outside your immediate kin.
  8. In return for a bride, the groom should provide her family with services or gifts.
  9. Marriage is a flexible economic partnership; it allows for multiple spouses and variations.

10. Men have the capacity to be more virtuous or ritually pure than women.
11. Youths should defer to seniors.
12. Late arrivals should defer to those who were here first.
In those societies that featured lineages, clans, or ancestor-based descent groups, the following new premises appeared:
13. When lineages grow and divide, the junior lineage should defer to the senior lineage, since the latter was here first.
14. You are born into your family, but you must be initiated into your clan.
15. The bad news is that initiation will be an ordeal. The good news is that you will learn ritual secrets, become more fully a member of your ethnic group, and perhaps gain virtue.
16. Any offense against a member of your lineage or clan, such as murder or serious insult, is an offense against that entire social unit. It requires a group response against some member (or members) of the offending group.
17. Any armed conflict should be followed by rituals of peacemaking.

Another widespread principle is that in life there are no accidents; everything happens for a reason. If you fall ill, it is because you have offended a spirit. If you die, it is because someone has worked witchcraft on you. Failed hunts are the outcome of hunting magic done wrong. Failed harvests are the result of rituals incorrectly performed.

Anthropologists define myth as a folktale believed to be true and regarded as sacred. Myth differs from legend, which is also believed to be true but not regarded as sacred.

It is not predetermined who the alphas will be. Chimps live in troops, and their social structure emerges from a series of interactions among individuals in the troop. These interactions, some confrontational, determine who the alphas, betas, and gammas will be. Nor is the hierarchy set in stone; betas have been seen forming alliances to overthrow an alpha by force. One of the victorious betas then takes over the fallen leader’s place.
According to primatologists John Mitani, David Watts, and Martin Miller, one of the ways that male chimps learn to create alliances is by hunting colobus monkeys together and sharing the meat. This food sharing could be seen as a precursor to the sharing of meat by human foragers. It does not, however, extend beyond the limits of the troop. No one has ever seen members of two chimpanzee troops meet at the border between their territories and exchange food. In fact, groups of males from Troop A have been observed ambushing and killing isolated males from Troop B. Thus when a troop of chimps has depleted the food in its territory, it cannot appeal for help to a neighboring troop. Chimps cannot do what human foragers do: accumulate social obligations with their neighbors as a hedge against lean times.

Our Ice Age ancestors temporarily put an end to leadership based on confrontation. As Christopher Boehm reminds us, the headmen of foraging groups were not bullies. They were generous, modest, and diplomatic, because their constituents were too skilled at alliance-building to put up with bullies. The fate of a bully was to be lured into the bush and shot with poisoned arrows.

In addition to transmitting secret ritual information, the churinga ilpintira was designed to elicit an awesome emotional response. Rappaport suspects that the precursors to human emotions might have been the deep bonds of love and dependence seen between mother and neonate in the apes. But emotion in humans evolved to be even stronger, strong enough to make intelligent people do irrational things, strong enough to inspire the selfless acts that strengthen society. Dancing, drinking, and singing for days, as some tribes did, opened a window into the spirit world and thereby confirmed its existence.
Society becomes the thing itself. We become its tools.


Chumash plank cnoe - 500 man-days of labor to make. The result was a vessel 19 to 22 feet long, made of redwood planks sewn together with milkweed cords and caulked with a mixture of asphalt and pine tar. In contrast to the earlier bulrush vessels, which were only eight … First, the ancestors of the historic chumash began pulling in swordfish and tuna, large fish that would have capsized a bulrush vessel. Second, each plank canoe could carry a ton of asphalt from the mainland for future caulking. Third, the channel islanders became producers and middlemen in the shell trade along the california coast. 

Beads from olive shells, abalone, and pimso clams. 

Chumash culture - strong hierarchy dominated by chiefs. - monopolized canoes, made themselves middlemen.

Lieutenant pedro fages was a spainish sldiers who spent the late 1770s at the mission of san luis obispo and travled among the chumash of the santa barbara coast. He took not of “Indain men who, both here and farther inland, are observed in the dress, clothing, and character of women.” Two or three men in each village.Some he said, permitted others “to practice the execrable, unnatural abuse of their bodies. They are called joyas and are held in great esteem.”

Two-spirit people - supernaturally destined to live life as a member of the opposite sex.

Let us now consider how such inequality might have been created. We have seen that generosity and reciprocity were important to egalitarian foragers. Such people expected that all gifts would eventually be reciprocated. They fed visitors who were in need but expected that one day theirgenerosity would be returned. They might loan one of their relatives pat of his bride payment but expected that loan to be repaid one day. With the passage of time, chronic failure to reciprocate was met first with grumbling and later with anger. Unpaid debts could lead to raiding and confiscation.
Some scholars suspect that in the riche conomy of the pacific northwest, loans and gifts escalated to a level where defaulting was punishable by raiding, captive-taking, and slavery. 
While reciprocal exchanges of gifts continued to be important among societies like the nootka, the emergence of inequality led to a new form of wealth transfer - since the chief was seen as owning all salmon fishing localities, those who fished there were obligated to pay him tribute in foodstuffs.
Tribute is a clear system of inequality but the asymmetrical relationship it reflects can be masked by displays of largesse. So important were these displays (feasts) that followers might abandon stingy chiefs and take up residence witht their more generous rivals.

Mesopotamia and beer: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4PVVVNr620
Different signs for different jars of a particular type of beer.
Built around malted beer, but a host of different brewing traditions built around different grains. Maize, millet, sorghum, rice, etc.
Golden, dark, sweet dark, red, strained.
Bulky ceramic filter.
Beer categorized by quality - ordinary, strong, very strong.
Liquid bread - but maybe a little rarer.
Man who comes home drunkand  is unable to please his wife in bed.
Beer was often consumed from a communal vessel through long reed straws.
Conical bowls that are cheap to produce and poor quality.

Beer and politics - feasting practices involving beer and inebriation played a key role in the process of state formation.restricted political system dominated by an inner circle of movers and shakers. Exclusive feasts helped separate newly elite off from the rabble.
Brewer and tavern keeper - brewer men, tavern keeper women.
Fed brewing byproduct to pigs.

Ingredients - barley groats and malt

Golden beer - emmer wheat, malted barley, bappir
They didn’t really know what the ingredients were

Malted barley - barley thats been allowed to germinate and start the process of breaking the starches in the grain down into fermentable sugars.
Bappir - some kind of crumbly bread or cake. One that could be dried out and stored for later use.disagreement about exactly what it was, and where it would have fit into the brewing process. Maybe some kind of roasted barley product. Maybe something akin to biscotti. Most likely somethink similr to cakes of nuri in korea = a fermentation starter
Raw grains - barley/emmer wheat. 
Roasted grains toasted, modified - ‘adjunct’ - possibly some involved separate fermentation stage.
Date syrup - primary sweetener - add early to increase sugars and boost fermentation, thus adding to alcohol content, or later as a sweetener
Aromatics - 
Coriander, cardamom, mint, fennel, cumin, watercress, garlic, mustard seed, juniper berries, tamarisk, honey, dates figs, plums, pomegranates, apples. Not hops.
Yeast - we dont know how mesopotamian brewers were etting the fermentation process started.

Bappir - we know it was associated with an oven. But if you want to argue that bappir was serving as a yeast source, well if you bake it that kills off the yeast and that doesn’t serve as a yeast source.  Bake bread at really low temperature, so it just dries it out for preservation purposes.
Hopps, climbing vine, resins in the hop, citrus flavors, piney, bitterness too. 


Dead simple - they used the foam from beer (what some call “barm”) today. This is mentioned as far back as the first century, when Pliny the Elder pointed out that some Gauls made bread that was finer and lighter than Roman bread because they used the foam from beer on it. But thousands of years before that the Sumerians, who made both bread and beer, probably already used the same method.
Until the start of the nineteenth century, “barm” and “yeast” were synonymous. Then an Austrian worked out how to extract a purer form of pressed yeast from the usual product and by the end of the century yeast was a separate item.
If you use “yeast” in the largest sense of a ferment using a particular kind of organism, then you’re also talking about sourdough, originally just a piece of dough from a previous batch which was used to ferment the next one. This goes back to Neolithic times - risen loaves have been found from that period. But it did not really catch on in Europe until the Romans took over and made leavened bread more popular.
While there are a number of items, including fruit juice, one can use to leaven dough, sourdough and (as a separate product) yeast have been the main ones for millennia.

The crushed malt is left in hot water for about an hour. We put a sleeping bag over the mash tun to keep the temperature stable for the starch converting enzymes to get to work. After about an hour, they have done their job and we have a mash tun full of sweetness. The mash is brown, no longer the pale crushed malt we started with. When the lautering and sparging is finished and we have our wort, the grains in the mash tun look as if they are whole. They are not. Only the husks remain. The starchy endosperm has all been converted into malt sugars by the enzymes. This leftover grain is draff, also known as spent grain or brewer's grains and it makes excellent animal fodder. One of the reasons why the archaeological evidence for mashing is minimal. 


Fire is the obvious way to heat a mash in a sealed earthenware pot, but you have to be careful - too much heat and the saccharification will not work. I made a hearth in our back garden and decided to find out whether I could mash in a pot. Here's a couple of photos of my first mashing experiments. Almost twenty years ago now. This work was done as part of my M.Phil research into the archaeological evidence for brewing in prehistory. I took some crushed pale malt and mixed it with cold water in an earthenware bowl. The porous bowl had been previously sealed with beeswax. I put the bowl on hot ashes to provide a gentle, consistent heat. I decided to start with cold water. The reason being that I could watch over the pot and wait for the correct temperature for the saccharification as the water slowly heated up. 

With no thermometer how would I know when the temperature was correct for mashing? This, in practice, turned out to be very easy. The mixture in the bowl began to smell sweet and delicious. The mash changed colour. I tasted it. It tasted sweet. The saccharification was obvious. While I watched the mash pot I made some little 'cakes' or 'biscuits' by making a thick mixture of crushed malt and water. These were put on the flat stone beside the fire. It had become quite hot by now. Splashing water on them occasionally to keep them a bit damp, it was again obvious that sugars were being made. I knew that the enzymes were transforming starch into sugars. I understood the technology and the science. In prehistoric times this transformation of inedible grain into sweetness was, perhaps, deemed to be magic. 

We put it in a bowl on the central hearth, surrounded by samples of modern barley, bere, crushed malt, wort and beer. The mash smelled delicious, people came in to see what was going on. It's much easier to explain the brewing process to people when there are samples available, to smell and to taste.  

We heated the water with hot stones, adding crushed malt when we could see our reflection in the hot water. This is an old technique for judging when the water temperature is correct for the strike, before thermometers were invented. It works. We used the hot stones to maintain mash temperature. It all worked perfectly.

            <Text> Elrahet sat back on her heels and from her voluminous rags she pulled out a half-moon knife, pulled its sharp edge in-between her fingers, and then asked for a volunteer. She was looking at Gugi and Seb.
“What do you need?” Gugi asked.


“The boy is dead, but his vessel remains intact. It needs a Spark. One of you must give it.”
Elrahet held Seb and then Gugi in her gaze. On each she lingered for a spell, holding them in turn so that she could project a sense of her confidence into them.
When neither of the two men stepped forward, Elrahet stressed the imperative word.
“Must,” she said. “You must give. This is a command. 
Hearing this, both Seb and Gugi knelt where they stood. They touched their foreheads to the earth in supplication.
It was Gugi who spoke first. “Take my Spark and release me from the struggle.”
Seb snuck a sidelong glance at his brother. Gugi’s eyes were closed and he . 
Elhrahet stood and setpped over to Gugi. She knelt in front of him. She set her hand on the back of his head. “I will shepherd your Spark and I cherish willingness with which it was given. Now there’s not much time. Do we not have time, Moto?”
Moto looked again through the lens. “They are coming on quickly,” he said.
“So they are,” Elrahet said. Then she quoted a proverb favored by the Ayramun. “Even the turning of the world conspires against us.” She stroked the back of Gugi’s head. “I am afraid that we cannot stand on ceremony.”
Seb lifted his head and watched as Elrahet peeled a sliver of selshi from the contents of the snarling bloodbowl. She brought the selshi to her mouth, whispered a prayer, then placed the selshi on her tongue and swallowed.
The was the f 
Elrahet closed her eyes, opened her palms to the sky, and sucked air into her chest in short, powerful sips - five of them. She held the wind in her lungs for a moment, then exhaled slowly through pursed lips. She repeated this breathing ritual five times, and at the end of it she had achieved the heightened state of Culrisar, defined as such by the Bloodwitch creed: Nothing but the body and the means to move it. 
Seb wondered how it worked. A long time ago he’d had it explained to him. The I/Me/Mine which defined ‘Elrahet’ was gone, along with all thoughts and urges that obscure the present moment. This was necessary if one were to handle the Spark of the Divine. But it didn’t make sense to Seb. How could a Bloodwitch know what she was doing if she, herself, her desires, her sense of duty and the whole rolling ball of past events was dissolved away? If there is only present, wouldn’t she forget what she was doing? Wouldn’t she be incapable of carrying out a task such as this?
It did not make sense. Yet there she was, gripping the hilt of the half-moon knife with serious intent, and when Seb looked into the her eyes he saw only himself reflected. He did not doubt that the Culrisar was real - there it was. The definitive proof could be seen in the way her fingers, lumpy knuckled and wrecked with uncontrolled trembling, gained calm and strength and precision. It was her right hand which gripped the knife, and swing it around in the air, hand trembling eliminated. In fact her whole posture was , back straight and . She was a different person. Possessed, perhaps. 
Maybe the witch had become a vessel for a ghost. Witches never talked about ghosts, but they talked about fleshy vessels all the time, and vessels are for holding things. Holding the Spark, yes, but what else? If the witch had left her own body, then who, or what, was moving it? It was a frightening thought, but it seemed to clarify the incongruity of Elrahet’s aged bones contorting about with such dexterity. And her face didn’t move. It did not frown or smile or grunt with the effort. She was like a minstrel’s marionette, limbs dancing as if weightless, face painted on. The thought Seb took from all this was that ghosts couldn’t control faces; if that was how it was, if there was ghost in Elrahet now, then ghosts couldn’t control faces. It was a bit . Made Seb proud. The little self-indulgence didn’t last long, for his focus was drawn to the sight of Elrahet setting the crest of the half-moon blade against the back of Gugi’s neck.
Elrahet spoke in a voice that was not her own. It was a younger woman’s, clear and fresh and brilliant. “Gugi Adeyongee,” she said. “Do not seek, for if your heart is kind you will be found.”
Then Elrahet put her thumb on the flat back of the half-moon blade and pressed down. She pressed the metal down with care and let up as soon the blade cleaved the skin in two. She then angled the blade cross-wise to that first cut and pressed down again. There was hardly any blood, just a two thin red lines, an ‘x’. It was so clean that it was as if she’d imprinted that crimson sigil on the surface of the skin with printing block instead of cutting the flesh open with a knife.
Elrahet took in a deep breath. When she exhaled she sucked in her stomach to push all the air out of lungs. As soon as she was sure that there was not a thimble of air within her, she bent over and put her lips to the wound she’d marked on Gugi’s neck. 
Then she breathed in his spark. 
It was quick, sharp inhale. Gugi gasped. His back spasmed and arched. His arms, his fingers, and his toes curled in towards his body as his muscles fought to keep the Spark’s threads from being yanked out. Though no one could see it, his face was pulled into a grimace of utter astonishment. 
This struggle did not last long. As quick as the tension had come, it left. And so Gugi’s prostrate form went limp and tipped over into the dirt.
A strange coldness washed over Seb. He knew that it was his brother’s heat being extinguished. That warm aura that he only noticed when they were huddled together against the chill of night was gone. Elrahet had taken it, she’d breathed it into her lungs. Gugi’s spark was in her lungs. Seb could see its soft orange flame flickering under her skin. Her whole neck was glowing, glowing so bright that Seb could see slivers of her spine’s shadow in her throat. Her cheeks were awash with light. Her pupils were bright as the sun. 


She took the two bloodbowls from beside the lizard and placed them next to the boy. Then she knelt down and pulled a thin needle-wing bone out from under her rags. She stabbed the tip of it down into the bloodbowl which held the sehsli, and in so doing filled the hollow bone with a measure of that blessed flesh. Then she used two fingers to pull the boy’s jaw open, and she leaned close to his mouth, muttered a warding spell, then began to probe his throat with the sharp tip of the wing bone. Once she found the precise spot with which to inject the seslsi, she jabbed down, pierced the decaying tissue, and then blew hard on the back of the bone, so hard that the force of her wind expelled the blessed flesh from out of the bone and into the boy.

Alla prima - wet-on-wet. Layers of wet paint ar applied to previously administered layers of wet paint.

Traditionally, a new layer of oil-based paint is applied to most parts of a painting only after allowing a previous layer to dry completely; this drying process can take from several days to several weeks, depending on the thickness of the paint. In contrast, work performed using alla prima can be carried out in one or more sessions (depending on the types of paint used and their respective drying times), and it is common for such a work to be finished in only one session or &quot;sitting&quot; 

The main focus of alla prima is edges: soft, blended ones contrasted with those sharply defined. However, being able to control these edges and the way the paint mixes requires preparation of colours and a decisive handling of the material. 

The alla prima technique is popular among plein air artists. When painting outside, you can’t be too precious about your subject nor the light as they change by the minute. This means plein air painting suits the spontaneity and time limits associated with alla prima painting.
However, even if you’re back painting in your studio, the direct painting technique is perfect for capturing fleeting moments in a spontaneous, fresh and immediate style.

The challenge of the alla prima technique really begins when there is a wet layer of paint over the whole surface and each new mark risks being blended too much.
If this happens, it is worth considering scraping it back. In other words, pressing the paint into the weave of the canvas, using a palette knife held parallel to the surface. After each scrape you need to wipe the knife clean on a rag so that colours aren’t spread from one area to another.

Yes, you can, but obviously the weave can eventually fill up and the benefits of having chosen a surface that readily takes more paint will be lost. However, the softening effect can be really useful with subtle transitions such as skin tones and skies. With facial features, it is good to paint them clearly, scrape them down a little and then restate them very selectively – for example, a line for an eyelash or highlight on the mouth. 


When it comes to alla prima painting, it helps to think of medium in two categories: liquid and gelatinous. Liquid mediums would be oils (such as linseed) or alkyd mediums such as Galkyd, which feel like oil, but speed up drying times. Adding a liquid medium to your paint will extend it and give it a creamy, buttery texture. This buttery consistency is better suited to laying the paint on and moving it around.
By contrast, gelatinous mediums would be things like Winsor &amp; Newton’s Liquin, Gamblin’s Solvent-Free Gel or anything that has some body to it. These gel mediums are great for building texture and achieving a thick application of paint.


Compensate for the color already on the canvas. For example, if you are mixing a dark color which needs to go on top of a light color on the canvas, then make your dark color just a bit darker than it needs to be. If you are mixing a vivid red which needs to go on top of a dull green, then make your red a touch more vivid than what it needs to be to compensate for any toning down caused by the green.
To apply paint on top of a wet layer without much mixing, use a very loaded brush or palette knife and drag paint loosely over the top. 
Take your time with mixing on your palette before you commit brush to canvas. Try not to rely on guesswork with your color mixing. Once paint hits the canvas, it is harder to control.
Work fat over lean (oily over thin paint). You will struggle to paint thin paint over fat paint without any mixing. I usually start a painting with thin washes then build up to paint straight from the tube. 

When painting alla prima, you can use pretty much any painting technique apart from glazing. This leaves you with many options for contrasting different types of brushwork. It’s also easier to make all the different types of brushwork fit together when painting alla prima, because there is always some subtle mixing. If you are painting with a layering approach (painting one layer, letting it dry then painting more) the different layers and techniques can look disjointed if you are not careful.

            <Title>Hemingway</Title>
            <Text>This book of short stories really fucks you up as a writer. You’ve got to remember this was his entire life here. Not one-year of short stories.

At that time he was spending all kinds of money around women trying to make himself seem a man and fool people, but it did’t have any effect on people that knew anything about him. He owed me over 600 pesos and he wouldn’t pay me. “Why do you want it now?” he’d say. “Don’t you trust me? Aren’t we friends?”
… There’s a queen for you. You can’t touch them. Nothing, nothing can touch them. They spend money on themselves or for vanity, but they never pay. Try to get one to pay. I told him what I thought of him right there o the Gran Via, in front of three friends, but he speaks to me now when I meet him as though we were friends. What kind of blood is it that makes a man like that?

A Natural History of the Dead
When that persevereing traveller, Mungo Park, was at one period of his course fainting in the vast wilderness of an african desert, naked and alone, considering his days as numbered and nothing appearing to remain for him to do but to lie down and die, a small moss-flower of extraordinary beauty caught his eye. “Though the whole plant,” says he, “was no larger than one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves and capsules without admiration. Can the being who planted, watered and brought to perfection in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed after his own image? Surely not. Reflections like these would not allow me to despair; I started p and, disregarding both hunger and fatigue, travelled forawrd, assured that relief was at hand. 
In war teh dead are usually the male of the human species although this does not hold true with animals, and I have frequently seen dead mares among the horses. 
Most of those mules that I saw dead were along mountain roads or lying at the foot of steep declivities whence they had been pushed to rid the road of their encumbrnce.  THey seemed a fitting enough sight in the mountains where one was accustomed to their presence and looked less incongruous there than they did later, at Smyrna, where the Greeks broke the legs of all their baggage animals and pushed them off the quy into the shallow water to drown. 
Regarding teh sex of the dead it is a fact that one becomes so accustomed to the sight of all the dead men that the sight of a dead woman is quite shocking. 
We agreed too that the picking up of the fragments had been an extraordinary business; it being amazing that the human body should be blown into pieces which wxploded along no anatomical lines, but rather divided as capriciously as the fragmentation in the burst of a high explosive shell.
Color change in caucasian races is from white to yellow to yellow-green to black. If left long enough in the heat the flesh comes to resemble coal-tar- especially where it has been broken or torn, and It has a quite a visible tarlike iridescence. They grow larger each day until sometimes they become to big for their uniforms, filling these until they seem blown tight enough to burst. The individual members may increase in girth to an unbelievable extent and face fill as taut and globular as balloons. 
The smeel cannot be remembered. IT is gon as completely as when you have been in love; you remember thigns that happened, but the sensation cannot be recalled.
The first thing you found about the dead was that, hit badly enough, they died like animals. Some quickly from a little wound you would not think would kill a rabbit. Some died like cats; a skull broken in and iron in the brain, they lie alive two days like cats that crawl into the coal bin with a bullet in the brain and will not die until you cut their heads off. 
The only natural death I’ve ever seen, outside of loss of blood, which isn’t bad, was death from Spanish influenza. In this you drown in mucus, choking, and how you know the patient’s dead is: at the end he turns to be a little child again, though with his manly force, and fills the sheets as full as any diaper with on vast, final, yellow cataract that flows and dribbles on after he’s gone. 
…that had seen the hot weather with a half pint of maggots working where their mouths have been. 
…wearing an alpine hat with an eagle feather in it and a hole in front you couldn’t put your little finger in and a hole in the back you could put your fist in, if iti were a small fist and you wanted to put it there. 

“A peasant with a black beard and high leather boots stood beside the grave. The sexton stopped shovelling and straightened his back. The peasant in the high boots took the spade from the sexton and went on filling in the grave -&gt; It’s the way he repeats ‘peasant in the high boots’  - reduces the man to a peasant in high boots. A prop. No room for dimension.
NO pronouns.
“The reset of the time it was spoiled by the sun. We were both tired of the sun. You could not get away from the sun.” 

Hemingway: the only shadows were made by rocks or by they hut that was built under the protection of a rock beside a glacier, and in the shade the sweat froze in your underclothing. You could not sit outside the hut without dark glasses. 

Hemingway: German peasant came to bury his wife: “No. He can only come, from where he lives, on skis until the snow melts. SO today he brought her in to be buried and the priest, when he looked at her face, didn’t want to bury her. You go on and tell it,” he said to the sexton. “SPek German, not dialect.”
“It was very funny with the priest,” said the sexton. “In the report to the commune she died of heart trouble. We knew she had heart trouble here. She used to faint in church sometimes. She did not come for a long time. She wasn’t strong to climb. When the priest uncovered her face he asked Olz, ‘Did your wife suffer much?’ ‘No,’ said Olz. ‘When I came in the house she was dead across the bed.’
“The priest looked at her again, He didn’t like it.
“ ‘How did her face get that way?’
“ ‘I dont know’, Olz said.
“ ‘Youd better find out,’ the priest said, and put the blanket back. Olz didn’t say anything. THe priest looked at him. Olz looked back at the priest. ‘You want to know?’
“ ‘ I must know’, the priest said.”
“This is where it’s good,” the innkeeper said. “Listen to this. Go on Franz.”
“ ‘ Well,’ said Olz, ‘when she died I made the report to the commune and I put her in the shed across the top of the big wood. When I started to use the big wood she was stiff and I put her up against the wall. Her mouth was open and when I came into the shed at night to cut up the big wood, I hung the lantern from it.’
“ ‘ Why did you do that?’ asked the priest.
“ ‘I don’t know,’ said Olz.
“ ‘ Did you do that many times?’
“ ‘Every time I went to work in the shed at night.’
“ ‘It was very wrong,’ said the priest. ‘Did you love your wife?’
“ ‘Ja, I loved her,’ Olz said. ‘I loved her fine.’ “

Because it was a very cheerful place, and because really cheerful people are usually the bravest, and the braveset get killed quickest, a big part of chicote’s old customers are now dead.</Text>

Ronnie osullivan - snooker
For the people that aren’t aware, he was asking because he was publicly humiliating tournaments for getting cheaper on paying players on the maximum. That’s why you see him, not want to hit the last black until the ref says something to him. There’s actually another tournament where he purposely gets the last colour ball opting the pink to purposely miss the maximum and got a 146. That’s how skilful this master is 
- epic build up, only to miss the final shot because the tournament were cheap skates.

Ronnie concedes early. Crowd gives steven a generous round of applause, but he just stands there dumbfounded.

            <Synopsis>Before they set out for Urghiz to deliver news of war to the king of the Jandrians, Pyetle is made to take a blood oath to Ayram</Synopsis>
            <Text>
When Sober, Pyetle would take the opportunity to wallow in his depression. Sober as he was, and stuck in the Ayramun’s pit cave, he had little else to do, so he closed his eyes and conjured up the memory which would not let him be: the memory of his father marching out into the Sand.
Pyetle could still recall the excitement of the day. All of Drissel had turned out to see his father off because the prospect that Sol’s Stone could be found by the men of their town was a point of local pride. It was also a holiday, the twelfth of Zun - Sol’s birthday. That meant all the little boys got to chase the Great Demon Damdramood through the streets. Even though Pyetle was only ten, and small for a ten-year-old, it was he who tackled Damdramood and knocked the prop stone out of his hands. As part of the celebrations, he gave the stone to his father. His father joked that now he didn’t have to go, since Sol’s Stone was sitting right there in his hands.

His father was marching under the command of a pale Imperial prince, and they were marching out to the Inner Mountain to find. His father was twenty-eight. The pale Imperial prince who rode at the head was just fourteen. Pyetle waved and waved until he couldn’t distinguish his father’s white silhouette from the rest of the expedition. 
Later that day, a smithy  could remember those telling him how legendary his father would be, how proud he should be. But Pyetle had reached that age where people arent sure how much the child really understands, how much he really sees, so the didn’t make any around him to hide their jesting comments of doubt, their smiles and about open positions here there, fresh opportunities for advancement. 
It was then he realized that no one thought his father would make it back. He didn’t.
Pyetle had no more tears for this memory. He’d already cried at every part of it. At the _. At teh _. And that’s what made so effective as a depressing instrument; it was a long drawn note that had lost it’s soul. IT could no longer stir the fire inside of him. At this age, it had finally pulled it all out. 
Out in the sand, Pyetle’s story wasn’t an uncommon one. He looked at around at the rest of the Ayramun, at their strange deformities, and wondered just how bad they’d had it as kinds. That tempered the mood. He had spent his long life feeling sorry for himself , but now, stuck as he was in the cold shadow of the Ayramun’s pit cave, he felt a little guilty about it. Only a little, though. All the other Ayramun had clothes and leathers to keep out the cold breath of the Underworld as it crept into the pit cave. All Pyetle had was Hill’s cloak. The thin, ragged tunic he’d gotten from Salavan’s wasn’t doing a thing.
When he asked if he could climb up and out of the cave so that he could get warm, Hill had said no; no one was allowed to leave until dusk for fear of being spotted by Imperial eyes. Pyetle wasn’t allowed a fire for the same reason. Hill told him to just bear it. “This the life of us Ayramun,” he had said. “And it not so bad. You not complain earlier?” 
Hill left before Pyetle could explain that the reason he didn’t complain earlier was because he drunk, so when the icy breath of the Underworld chilled his fingers and toes he couldn’t ignore it. His sobriety was making him regret the whole situation, so he decided to scan the cave for signs of alcohol.

But before Sob could finish explaining that the stone’s got to be part of the test, that it’s got to be thrown or stabbed or something, he was interrupted by a bird whistle fluttering down from above. It was a soft little twitter, nothing obnoxious, the kind of thing Pytele would’ve brushed off if Moteah and Sob didn’t look like they’d just heard a divine command. Even when the twittering died down, the two kept their eyes skyward, clearly expecting something more. 
It didn’t take long for Pyetle to put two and two together: this wasn’t some rare desert bird peeking in, tweeting warnings that big mammals were near the nests and holes; it was an Ayramun signal. It had come from one of the scout’s up above, a near perfect imitation of the real thing.
Pyetle looked around at the rest of the Ayramun - they were all awake, alert, and silent. Most had their heads craned upwards like Sob and Moteah. All were clearly expecting another message.
When nothing came, Sob broke the silence.
“You might just get your wish, Pyetle.”
Pyetle was about to ask what he meant, but Moteah shushed him.
Then another tweeted song came floating down. This one, Pyetle recognized.
“That’s a purple starling,” he said under his breath.
Moteah nodded. “An Imperial starling.”
Just as the words were out of her mouth, the cave went abuzz with whispers and ruffled movement. Here and there, Ayramun rushed to roll up their tarps and padded skins. Some simply dropped whatever they were doing and started to climb up and out of the cave. Hill was one of them. He and a few others free-climbed up the wall via series of ledges. Even though they carried bags up with them, strapped to their backs, they kept a clean, steady pace. Pyetle assumed they’d done this hundred’s of times, this particular climb. There were no searching hands or feet, they just floated up the rock-face. Once at the top, they disappeared.
“Well ain’t that interestin’,” Sob said as he finished bundling the clothes that Pyetle wasn’t using. “You’re stone is either the luckiest in the world, or the unluckiest. Might just be cursed.” He looked up at Pyetle with excitement. “Needs more testin’, don’t it.”
“What do you mean?” Pyetle asked.
“What do I mean? Gods man, no wonder you’ve not got a grasp of luck, even when it slaps you in the face.”
“This is just coincidence,” Moteah said. “It’s not like a bunch of Imperials popped into existence as soon as Pyetle wished to get out of this cave. 
“Coincidence?” Sob said. “The man says he wants to get up and out o’ this hole, and next thing comes, and its up and out o’ this hole he’s gettin’. ‘Just a coincidence’, Listen to yerself.”
“Seems like good luck to me,” Pyetle said, smiling.
“Now hold on there.” Sob said. “Might not be good luck. It’s not sunshowers and sugarplumbs drivin’ us out o’ this hole. It’s a herd of Imps marchin’ straight towards us. On horseback no less.”
“Horseback?” Pyetle asked. “You got all that from a tweeting bird?”
“Aye,” Sob said. “The count, too. Roughly fifty of ‘em.”
“This is just a precaution,” Moteah assured Pyetle. “What they’ve spotted up there, some company of Imperials, they’re still a long ways off. They don’t know that we’re here.”
“As may be,” Sob said. “But that don’t mean they ain’t lookin’ for us, ‘cause they’re definitely lookin’ for him!” 
Sob pointed to Mazyd.
“Are they?”
“They’re on horseback. Riding out into the Sand. I’d wager more than money that’s a search party. Only people Imps care about are those damned Seilsi.”
“That’s ridiculous,” Moteah said. “Sand’s too big to search like that. Horses don’t do well out on Charnel Roads.” 
“That’s just the thing. Makes no sense to be out on horses in this heat unless they know exactly where they’re goin’. And what’s out here for them to find? Nothin’ but us!”
Moteah cast a wary eye at Mazyd. She didn’t think it was possible for the Imperials to know where they were, but she’d heard stories about the Seilsi like all the rest. Mazyd didn’t have hands, but there might be some hidden magic
Regardless, she didn’t argue any further with Sob. There wasn’t any time. So, she made to help Sob wrap up his things. 
The sight of Moteah helping Sob was strange to Pyetle. Just moments ago, Moteah looked like she wanted to kill the man any way she could, now, she was gathering up his things - a pipe, a scattered bunch of tresla, sandspit - and putting them into a larger leather sack. Pyetle chalked this kindness up to the urgency of the moment, but he wondered if it wasn’t a sense of kinship driving it.
Most of the others were already finished gathering up their things because they didn’t have much, and what they did have was made to be quickly folded and packed in sacks. These sacks had corded loops for easy hauling, and already some of them were being pulled up and out of the cave with ropes. The rest of the things to be hauled out were being lined up at the foot of the wall. Among them were the tarred leather bags packed with foodstuffs, the waterskins, bundles of bows and arrows wrapped in cotton sheets, and Mazyd, all wrapped up in his new cloak.
When Mazyd’s turn to be hauled up came, the rope was wrapped around his chest and groin. Mazyd’s new leathers took the brunt of the biting rope, but as he ascended up into the air, he would bounce and scrape against the rockface. He couldn’t do anything about it because his arms were tied up against his sides.
Moteah was watching him go up, wincing all the while. When Mazyd was finally, roughly, pulled over the top, and the rope was thrown back down, she told Pyetle he was next.
“Can’t I just climb up it?” Pyetle asked as she started to tie the rope around him. She couldn’t answer because she had to use her mouth to hold one end of the rope steady as she wrapped it around him. Only after she was done, and before she tied him in with a knot, did she entertain Pyetle’s fear.
“You think you can climb this?” she asked. “Do you even know how to climb a rope?”
“You just… climb it, right?”
“No. There’s no time for this. This will be safer, believe me. It’ll be easier. I don’t think you can climb it, anyways.” She then looped the rope around each leg and knotted it tight around shoulder blades. “You’re skinny as hell.” She then gave three tugs on the rope and Pyetle began to rise.
But Pyetle’s weight wasn’t centered on the rope, so as soon as he was hoisted up into the air he started to spin. It wasn’t a violent spin, but it was undignified nonetheless, and it was just enough to prevent him from catching himself against the rock-face with his hands and feet, meaning with each tug upwards he’d bump and scrape against the sandstone, just like Mazyd.
And upwards he went. It didn’t take long because whoever was pulling him was clearly intent on being done with the whole ordeal as soon as possible. When Pyetle’s head finally breached the surface, he found that there were two men pulling him up. Both black as Moteah. One of them was missing an arm, just like Moteah. The other, upon seeing Pyetle’s bald head pop out of the ground, nearly dropped the rope in surprise.
“Oh shit! Gammel, stop! It’s a person!”
“But the Seilsi already up here.”
“It’s the new guy.”
“Oh. Right.”
“You hold steady. I’ll help him up. You got it?”
“He light as air.”
“Yeah. I thought he was a bundle of dried pilk.”
The nearest man, the two armed man, he dropped the rope and stepped over to the lip of the cave where Pyetle hung half-in, half-out.
“Sorry bout the rough pull,” the man said with a deep Zozan lilt. “I thought you were a bundle of dried pilk.”
He then grabbed the part of the rope which was wrapped around Pyetle’s chest, and with one forceful yank, he pulled Pyetle out of the cold shadow of the cave and in into the Sand.
It was still afternoon, so the ground was still hot. Pyetle wanted to just lay there and revel in it, but the Zozan who had pulled him out was already fiddling with the knots that kept Pyetle bound to his rope.
“Roll over,” the Zozan commanded. 
Pyetle did as he was told. 
“Oh, and I’m Zouga,” the man said. “You’re Pyetle, right? Well that man there is Gammel.”
Gammel waved. He only had one arm.
Zouga’s deformity was clear as well: his upper lip was cleft in two. It wasn’t nearly as bad as some Pyetle had seen, where the whole upper jaw is split, but nonetheless, Zouga’s front teeth were permanetly fixed into a grin. Zouga had filed them down to a point so they stood out from his face like fangs, just like the lizard brothers.
“This isn’t a good look, my friend,” Zougaz said.
“What? Is something wrong?” Pyetle asked.
“Not a good look if you can’t pull your own weight, friend. Literally can’t do it. I joke, but really, not a good look.”
“Sorry.”
“I don’t mind. I don’t care. Everyone else will get all pissy. Got to pull your own weight around here.”
“I don’t weigh that much.”
Zougaz’s smile seemed more like a snarl. He pulled the tangle of rope out from Pyetle’s tangle of bones. “Right. You’re small. Very small. Still, what do you do? Some of us have got a little bet going. Gammel’s got you down as a thief, seeing as we picked you up near Mudwater.”
“A thief? No. I haven’t stolen a thing since I was a child.”
Gammel groaned in disbelief. Zouga’s smile went even wider. It was horrific.
“You’re a cook, aren’t you?” Zouga said. “I bet you know all the herbs from here to Changrala. I learned a lot from the last cook we had. He could do up a lizard just right.”
“I’m a terrible cook.”
“Not a cook?” Zouga’s shoulders slumped. “Why’d Ayram pick you up then?”
“I don’t know,” Pyetle said.
Zouga threw the rope back down into the cave and reassumed his position next to Gammel.
“Everyone here’s got a thing they do,” he said. “Got to pull your own weight.”
“I know beans.”
“You know beans?”
“I know bean-curd.”
“Bean-curd?”
“Yes, bean curd.” 
“You farm?”
“A little. I mostly paid others to do the farming. For me it was more the buying and selling. Back in Mudwater I leased land and would buy the kelly-beans grown on it, and then -”
“Wait, wait, wait, wait,” Gammel said. “People leased the land from you, and then you bought the product right back? You suckered those shits into growing your beans? For free?”
“It’s not as simple as that,” Pyetle said. 
“It sounds simple.”
“It’s not it’s… Look, if I was making an easy, free living, I wouldn’t be out here, would I?”
“You couldn’t turn a profit? You get your product free and you still couldn’t turn a profit?”
“I said its not that simple.”
“How is that not simple?” Gammel asked. “You sell the land and get money, buy the beans and lose money, then sell the beans and get money. That’s two get moneys and one lose moneys.”
“Like I said -”
“Don’t expect me to believe you leased the land for so little that you couldn’t recoup the cost. How the hell could screw up being a landlord?”
“I don’t want to be rude, but it’s not really your business.”
“Not yours either, evidently. And it’s not like this place is bean country. It’s not buying and selling country either. It’s all killing and stealing.”
“And the land owns itself,” Zouga added. 
Gammel nodded in agreement. “Damn right it does. Fences and walls don’t last out here. Can’t imagine what use Ayram saw in a scrawny little leech.”
“And what are you, Gammel?” Pyetle asked.
“I’m a straight-up thief.”
“A thief?”
“Sure.”
“Not much more than a leech yourself, then.”
Zouga and Gammel looked at eachother and laughed. Then Zouga narrowed his eyes at Pyetle and said, “Gammel’s no leech old man. He doesn’t steal for himself.”
“What, he steals for you?”
“For all the Ayramun.”
“But that just makes all of you leeches, doesn’t it?”
“All men are leeches. Only the land produces.”
“That’s kind of what I’m trying to say. I don’t get why he’s being so sanctimonious about how I made my living back in Mudwater.”
“I’m not being sanctimonious,” Gammel said. “It’s like Zouga said, you need to pull your own weight out here. Can’t be expecting other people to do work while you sand there mouthing about.”
“I don’t.”
Zouga grunted. “What are you doing right now?”
Pyelte leaps into action. Grabs the cord in between Zouga and Gammel. Gammel upon seeing this laughs and drops his end of the rope.
Zouga laughed. “He’ll learn, eh? You can teach him, Gammel. Oh, wait! Stop!”
They stopped hauling the rope.
“What is it?” Gammel asked.
“It’s another person.”
“What?”
“It’s Moteah.”
Pyetle looked towards the big hole in the ground, and sure enough, the top of Moteah’s head was there, bobbing up and down.
Eager to seem useful, Pyetle rushed over to pull her up, but Moteah was already climbing out, so he just knelt there and looked ready-to-help while she mantled the lip of the cave. 
“The hell are you doing, woman?” Gammel asked. “Climb like the rest of us. I’ve got things to pull.”
Moteah didn’t respond. Instead she undid the knot of rope around her chest, and then threw the length of it back down into the cave. Then she stood up and dusted herself off, all the while pretending not to notice that she’d pissed Gammel off. This, of course, pissed Gammel off more.
“Woman!” Zouga shouted. “I asked you a question!”
Moteah ignored him. “Alright Pyetle,” she said. “Time to get a move on. Ayram needs to see you. Come on.”
But Zouga wasn’t about to let her leave. He dropped his rope and stomped over to her.
Moteah gave him a glare. After a tense moment, he spat, and returned to the rope to continue hauling. There, the only thing he could do to Moteah was stare daggers into her back as she and Pyetle walked away.
“Zouga really doesn’t like you, huh?” Pyetle asked, once they were out of earshot.
“Of course not. He’s my brother.”
“Your brother!? I guess I can see that.”
“Oh? How so?”
“Just the, uh, physical resemblance. Strange that you two are both missing arms. Opposite arms though.”
“It’s because were born joined together. He’s my right arm, and I’m his left.”
“You two were conjoined?”
Moteah nodded. “We were separated after birth. There wasn’t much connecting us. Thank the gods. He’s such an ass.”
“Is he?”
“Yeap. I rode the rope up just to annoy him.”
“Conjoined twins… I’ve heard of it but never seen it.”
“It is what it is. ”
“Are you safe from him? He’s got violence in his eyes. No mistaking it.”
“Don’t worry about me. You need to worry bout yourself.”
“You sure? He seemed pretty-”
“Pyetle, really, don’t worry bout me. You need to worry bout yourself. And speaking of - there are things out in the Sand that only Ayram can save you from. He won’t be able to save you if you haven’t taken the oath. Since we’re goin out into the Sand, you need to be taking the oath.”
“What does this oath involve?” Pyetle asked.
“It ain’t too painful.”
“Too painful?”
“It’s a blood oath. There’s going to be blood.”
Pyetle grimaced. “What? Why?”
“Look, we’ll kill you if you don’t do it.&quot; 
“Okay…”
“But you shouldn’t take the oath just because you don’t want us to kill you.”
Pyetle laughed.
“What?” Moteah asked. “You got to be doing it for the right reasons.”
“And what reasons are those?”
Moteah shrugged. “It’s different for everyone.”
“Why did you take the oath?”
“That’s between me and Ayram.”
“So I either take the oath, or you kill me. That just doesn’t seem… Well, let’s say I took the oath, but I just said the words without meaning them.”
“There’s no words.”
“Well, ok.... Then suppose I just went through the motions.”
“It ain’t that kind of oath. Maybe oath ain’t the right word. It’s more… I don’t know. It’s hard to describe. It’s more like an experience.” 
Moteah pointed at a hill just down the road. “See that hill with the dead tree right on top of it? There’s a cave in that hill. Pella, the witch, and Ayram will be waitin’ inside. That’s where you make the oath. Don’t make ‘em wait long.” 
“You aren’t coming?”
“It’s your oath,” Moteah said. “I’ve got other things to do.&quot;
Pyetle watched Moteah walk back towards the pit, where the other Ayramun were strapping up for the journey ahead. On the way she stopped, picked up a rock, and rolled it around in her fingers. Pyetle wondered if she was thinking about luck. He wondered if she really thought there was no such thing. As if to give him an answer, she threw rock side-arm over a little mound.

Name to a crocodile - marakai.

—-
The stone made a funny noise wherever it landed; a kind of delayed echo. It didn’t bother Moteah, but Pyetle was intrigued - there seemed to be another pit. He walked over to check it out, and sure enough, a deep and wide hole opened up into the ground. Another pit cave. No one was in this one, and it didn’t seem to open up into the Underworld. It was just a big hole in the ground, unconnected to anything but the outside air. 
It got Pyetle to wondering just where he was. In the Sand there is a place called the Pitted Portion, a place filled with sinks and holes and caves, but that was a thousand leagues from Dissel, and he couldn’t have made that journey in just one night.
Just to be sure, Pyetle scrambled up a little graveled hill and climbed atop a boulder to get a better view of the place. He expected to see something familiar, like the Blackshell hills or the . The Blackshells were indeed there to the east, but only their peaks, so far away that their white tips barely gleamed through the thick haze of distance. 
The rocky ground all around wasn’t clay, it was rock. Thickly pitted for miles. Most pits weren’t so dramatic as the one he’d come out of, as most edges were sloped and sagged or cratered instead of dropping sheer into the earth. In between these holes there were wide, flat spaces of dry sandstone, but there were also great mounds of boulders and gravel, just like the one he was standing on. Undoubtedly , this was the Pitted Portion. 
No one knew how these pits came to be. There was no river running through it, nothing to carve a winding canyon. It was just like the rest of the Junei plain, only with holes and the rubble that had, presumably, once filled them. Standing there, Pyetle felt certain in Truth of the Solean Myth of Damdromidon - what else but a great demon looking for the buried heart of the earth could explain this cavernous plain?
— When Pyetle had looked at maps to trace the route had taken, he’d come to expect a clear delination between portions. Pitted is here and windy is there. But looking out he wondered if the pitted portion ever ended, if the names given were even useful. If the different parts of the sand were even clear enough to warrant a category, or if it was one big clusterfuck.
Then a voice shouted from the base of his little promontory.
“Pyetle! What are you doing?”
Pyetle turned in fright and saw Ayram standing there, looming large even though he was a good thirty meters away.
“Just taking a look!” Pyetle shouted back. “Is this really the Pitted Portion?”
“Did Moteah not make it clear to you that there are Imps about, looking for us?” Ayram asked.
Pyetle took a quick look around for any sign of Imperial riders.  “I don’t see any.”
“Do you think that they might see you?”
In his rush to scramble off the boulder, Pyetle fell butt-first onto the slope of the hill. He was able to catch himself, so instead of rolling down the scree, he slid down it. When he got to the bottom, he stood up in front of Ayram and apologized.
“I’m sorry. I was just curious. I’m not used to the whole desert bandit thing. Hiding in holes and whatnot.”
Ayram wasn’t looking at Pyetle. He was looking at the cloud of dust that Pyetle had kicked up when he slid down the scree. It was rising slowly into the air, twirling in on itself, measuring both the vortex/convective wind and the magnitude of Pyetle’s shame.
Ayram shook his head.
“Pyetle, do people find you to be annoying? Is this kind of thing a common kind of thing with you?”
Pyetle’s jaw would have dropped at the bluntness of the question if it weren’t already drawn tight by embarrassment. As such, Pyetle could barely stammer out the word, “No.”
“You need to understand something, so I’m going to state it clearly,” Ayram said. “I invest in people. My people. Ayramun. And I’ll invest in you if you do something with it.”
Pyetle nodded.
“I haven’t made the point yet,” Ayram said. 
Pyetle, looking up, thought Ayram seemed inhuman. Greater than human. He was so much bigger, too big to be the same kind of thing as he.
“You’re a little careless, Pyetle. That’ll get you killed. There’s no shame in getting killed - but carelessness? Is that how you want to go?”
“No.”
“Then keep in mind that things out here are trying to kill you. Right now they’re trying to kill you. Not just the Imps. Bugs. Lizards. The sun. Hell, there could be a beatboar hogging your scent. If I can smell the drink on you from here, then he can from a mile away.”
“I’m sorry.”
Ayram smacked his teeth, like he’d just tasted something foul. “Out here the kind of mistakes that require apologies are the ones that get people killed. So don’t ever say that. ‘I’m sorry’. Not to me. Just do better. Else I’ll be trying to kill you too.”
“I understand.”
“You don’t. But I have a way to make it a little clearer. Come.”
Pyetle followed Ayram around the lip of the pit and back to where Moteah had left him. From there they went to the hill with the cave where he was to take his oath. The entrance to it was narrow, and it matched Pyetle’s height, so Ayram had to duck down and shimmy sideways to get in. Pyetle stopped at the entrance, and tried to see inside.
The interior was lit by a narrow sliver of sunlight that cut down from the entrance and crawled along the floor. It was enough because the cave was small, and the light could bounce around. It was almost like the inside of sandstone ball, with Ayram standing at the far end. To his right, was Pella, hunched and. To left was the witch Elrahet. In between them, cut into the rock floor, was a round hole the width of a foot. 
When Pyetle stepped into the cave, his body cut out the light. Elrahet and Pella each grabbed a wrist, and then Ayram dropped something into the hole.
“How do you feel about the Empire?” Pella asked. Her grip was firm and tight, stronger than Pyetle had expected from a woman of her age.
“I don’t really care about it one way or the other,” Pyetle said. He was sure that Pella had been expecting him to say he hated the Empire. All the other Ayramun seemed to. But something about the scene suggested simple honesty was the best course of action. He felt that something was considering him, sniffing him out. Some sense oustide the normal, which could target truth.
“The Empire kills and it rapes,” Pella replied. “It grinds the wealth and culture of the world to dust. Have you not seen it? Is that not why you are here among us?”
Pyetle was unsure of what to say. His answer would obviously be ‘no’, so he didn’t understand why Pella was pressing the issue. She was trying to catch him out. For what reason, he couldn’t fathom. Maybe she just didn’t like him. 
In the end it was Ayram who answered Pella’s question.
“Pyetle is here because he followed me here. It is as simple as that.”
“No passion, then,” Pella croaked. 
“Remove your shirt.”
Pyetle did.
An odor began to rise out of the hole in the ground. A green glow.
Then Elrahet stabbed in him the belly with a knife.
He doesn’t feel much. Wanted to scream but couldn’t. The words caught in throat, and he couldn’t breath. 
Ayram then reached out, grabbed his shoulder, and threw him him face down to the earth. Pyetle’s belly, and his open wound, was flush over the hole. Then his sense started to dull. He could no longer smell the sulfur. But instead of going dark, his mind began to swim with visions. Flashes of  color, different scenes. The outlines of Ayram’s eyes swirling through them, part of them, edges lost but still there, watching. 
‘Coming to’ moment where ayrams true visage are loaded behind the eyes. Pyetle begins to wonder if Ayram gave him the vision or share in it. If he knew what he was thinking, etc.
After some time, which Pyetle later learned was only a minute, Ayram pulled him up from the ground. When Pyetle searched his belly, he found there was no wound, and that in its place was the brand of the Ayramun.
&quot;Rise my child, Pyetle of the Ayraman. You have been consecrated.”


Purpose of this hallucination is to hint at Ayram’s capacity to truly end a human’s soul.






Oddness with his blood. Indicates that he isn’t commited. -swirls it around a bowl to check the body, the thickness, how many drips fell down the side of the bowl. Elrahet- “His blood is thin but sharp.</Text>

“Yeah.”
 “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi,
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.”

            <Text>I have smoked everyday for 15 years, besides quitting while pregnant and the offtimes I couldn't find a dealer before it was legal for recreational use.
I definitely think I am addicted. No joke about it. But perhaps it's not in itself an addictive substance. It's just that we become too dependant on how we feel when we are high, or how acceptable mediocrity is when we are high.
I know past times when I've quit, I struggle with boredom more than anything else. And the boredom seems just so unavoidable, you have to make it over this weird hurdle of reclaiming the joy you once had in your hobbies and stuff like that. It's not easy.

You said it perfectly, friend. I’m addicted, and I’d be lying to myself if I said otherwise. A lot of it is habit - I like the hand-to-mouth of smoking joints while doing other things. And part of it self-medicating. Weed helps my anxiety in the short term, but definitely hurts my depression in the long term.
Haven’t touched my guitar in years, and my only real hobby lately has been hiking (which I do stoned). My place is a mess and I’m really not on top of things like I used to be (aside from work).
I find it easiest to abstain when I’m busy. The temptation is way stronger when I’m sitting around doing nothing, so I just find ways to keep my mind occupied. (I’m single w/o kids, though, so this is probs more realistic for me than for others)
Have you noticed a change in your sleep quality? When I’m smoking, I wake up everyday feeing like I got hit by a bus. That’s not the case when I’m abstaining for long periods

I like weed.

            <Text>Not to mention, in actual fencing all parries should also be attacks, specifically to avoid similar tricks. You can do similar things with conventional blades by trying to flourish around their block. Of course, it would be possible for them to intercept such a flourish, unlike this move. But that is less efficient that just going for a strike from the beginning to punish them if they were to try something like that. The problem with this clip is the defender is blocking like an actor, not a duelist. 

I do quite a bit of epee and sabre fencing. Lightsaber “blades” carry no weight, so there’s no reason to hold them with two hands like they do in that video. If you use one hand only, your reach vastly improves and your target area decreases.
I think if two non-Jedi humans used lightsabers, it would make most sense for it to evolve into a battle of small cuts to the weapon hand and arm (similar to epee, only with more slashing and less stabbing).

            <Title>RiverParty</Title>
            <Text>
Twenty years ago, Pyetle met his first wife Seculla at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Shagotan functionary was entertaining some Hrkkan dignitary, and so the wine was flowing and the air was thick with ambition. Not a place for depressed people. They don’t have the stamina for it. Both Pyetle and Seculla were depressed people. They filtered through the pretension and collided in one corner of the cordoned off where they clustered together for sanity. This sparked a relationship. After this, they began to write letters back and forth.
Pyetle found it difficult to explain that he was depressed because he came from old money. It’s not a sympathetic cause and so even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn’t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract. He wrote to Seculla about how he hated the word ‘depression’.
 He remarked that a ‘depression’ is just a bit of land that’s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you’re walking along you’ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It’s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea. It’s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words a depression isn’t depressing. 
Mandrameen thought the use of the word was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him. Made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone’s been sad, so everyone’s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they’ve got the place mapped, but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn’t on any goddamn map. You get lost there. You don’t come back.
Seculla wrote back that he was, again, being a fool. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place in the world was a depression: the Empty Portion. It’s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the Shamal blows in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings monsoons in from the south-west. 
The Empty Portion is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is the desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of it, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting object for Mandrameen’s analogy, that was it, and it was a depression, and it most certainly was on a map.
Mandrameen was too sentimental about the Sands to agree with her. The Empty Portion was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure. He’d wax on about virginal passages and rich young men who fought to be the first to expose and penetrate its secrets. Besides, the Gods lived there, the Desert Fathers lived there, and so he couldn’t possibly think of it as depressing.
Eventually, and this took months, subtle lust worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the Earth best suited to the task was the Underworld. The sun can’t reach there, so you can only see as far as the light that you carry. There is no color or life. There’s just the maze of rock, the abyss, and your own private thoughts. There’s nothing to do but wander and wait for death.
What they didn’t consider - what they didn’t know - was Fear. Not the blunt, cerebral fear that might keep the depressed in bed, but the sharp, waking fear that keeps a man running through the Underworld. Neither Mandrameen nor Seculla had ever truly gazed into the abyss. The real things, the avens of the Earth, they’re chittering-chattering throats that threaten to vomit out teeth and claws and demons should you turn your back. They spike the body with tension, they push out all thoughts and worries save one: Back. Out. Slowly. 
If Mandrameen and Seculla had ever been forced to crawl through the damp dark of the Underworld, as Pyetle was forced by Ayram and Hill, their error would have slapped them in the face. The only thing keeping Pyetle from losing his wits entirely was the drink. He couldn’t fixate on the terror even if he tried.</Text>

            <Text>
All chatter ceased and all eyes turned to them. None seemed to care much for Mandri, as Oro’s pale and bloody pulp captivated the crowd.
One of their number stood up, and like the shadow of a tree he towered over the others. towering a good three feet over Bib, was the tallest man that Mandri had ever seen, a beard-bushed man, a brow beaten man, a man of a man.
 He let loose a shrill whistle for attention. Everyone else promptly sat down. The giant then began walke to Mandri and his company, out of the shadow and into the light, and Mandri saw that it was Ayram. Who else.
 Mandri looked at Oro who stood transfixed in Ayram’s gaze. He wondered.Then there came a tugging at Mandri’s shirt. It was Moteah.
He was beckoning Mandri to follow and whispered, “Come on!” 
Mandri trailed him around the edge of the pit to join the others in the pit’s shadow. Ayram began to speak just as he sat down.
“Before we decide what to do with this prisoner -” Ayram slapped Oro on the back. The action nearly buckled Oro’s knees. He looked like a child next to Ayram. Everyone does. 
“Before we decide what to do about him, we need to address Papi and Colm. It’s come to my attention that some of you are blaming Elrahet for their deaths.” Ayram had his arm extended out, and his piercing blue eyes were scanning the crowd, as if to accuse them all, even the ones who dared listened to the gossip. “That stops now.” 
He let the finality of his words echo around the pit. Whatever ill-will his people bore towards his witch, it was now gone. 
“In case you aren’t aware,” he continued, “this man here is a Mazydai!”
He shoved Oro forward and down to the ground. 
Mandri was especially moved to see a Mazydai brought so low.
“For those of you who don’t know,” Ayram said, “this slight excuse for a man is one of the Empire’s most lauded generals and one of its most coveted weapons. He could have killed us all in heartbeat if Elrahet’s storm hadn’t raged.”
“Elrahet!” cheered one of the crowd, and the rest clapped in approval.
“We should also thank Pella for her quick decision to take this scoundrel’s hands.” Even as Ayram said it, the cheers and plaudits grew loud for Pella. Mandri followed Moteah’s gaze and saw an old woman soaking it. She was smiling and waving as if all the others were her children.
“Many more than just Papi and Colm would have died if it weren’t for that bolt of fire from the sky,” Ayram declared. “If my command is not enough, and any of you still have something to settle about Papi and Colm, then it's me you need to see. There’s no room in this life for bitch talk and rabble rousers. You have a problem, come see me.” He slapped his great chest with his fist, daring them to actually do it. “ I’ll be fair for as long as you are honest.”
“Now,” he said, turning to the crumpled form of Oro. He reached down with one hand, grabbed him by the neck, and pulled him up to his feet. “What are you doing in my desert?”
Oro stood there, his face drawn tight in pain, and did not answer. 
“Speak, man!” Ayram shouted. “Is the Empire so scared of my family that they’d send you to root us out?”
Oro looked up at Ayram and said in the most matter of fact tone imaginable, “I don’t even know who you are.”
 Ayram grinned beneath his beard and a wild look came into his eyes. “You know, I can tell when someone is lying.”
“All I know is that your name is Ayram.”
“And your what is your name, sir?” Ayram asked.
“Oro Uro.” 
“Pella! Is this the one who burned your family alive?”
Pella shouted her answer. “No! I’ve not heard that name.”
“Oro Uro…” Ayram repeated. “You were sent to hunt us, yes? A devious Imperial trap, no?”
“Have you not stopped to consider,” Oro said with frustration, “That you were the trap for me?”
“Aye, but I don’t think anyone would reasonably expect that such a small band of simple thieves could overcome a Mazydai mage. No one would send a wolf like you into a den of foxes and expect it to lose. Hah!”
“Yet here I am.”
“Here you are indeed. But why? This won’t be over until I get an answer. I can get Elrahet involved if you like. A little blood magic will tease it out of you. You’ve got enough of it left, no?”
Oro looked out at the faces of the crowd. He found Mandri’s and smiled.
“I was looking for your hovel in the mountains,” he said.
“We have no such place.”
“The Jandrian tribes. The place they’ve all fled to. It's some ruin in the mountains.”
“Urgiz?”
“Yes, that’s what they call it.”
“And what do you care about that forsaken place?”
For the first time, Mayzed took Ayram eye to eye, and said, “I was tasked to deliver a sword to your king.” 
A stillness swept over the crowd. One of them stood and shouted, “He lies!&quot;
Another stood and tried to shout him down. “A Mazydai does not lie!” 
Oro looked out at Ayram’s followers to let them judge for themselves the earnest truth written on his face. 
“The light of the law is coming to you and your kin!” he shouted.
“You mean the light of War!” 
“Barbarians make war,” Oro spat. “The Empire makes peace!”
His words set the band of outlaws buzzing. Mandri was pushed into the sand as others rushed over him, each shouting “Murderer!”, and “Demon!”. Moteah was enraptured. He stood next to Mandri’s and shouted, “Genocidal Demon!” so many times and with so much gusto that he nearly fainted. 
Ayram himself was unmoved. He held out his hand, but when that didn’t work he let loose another shrill whistle. The outlaws settled back down.
“We did find a sword,” Ayram said. “We found seventy-seven of them!”
At that there was a great cheer. Oro rolled his eyes.
“But yes, we did find an unusual one, too. Pella, bring it here.”
Old Pella got up, walked to Ayram, and pulled from her bundle of robes a wooden sword. It was immaculately carved and polished to a sheen. The base of its blade and its guard was inlaid with gold, and its half-shell pommel was trimmed with jade stars. Burned into its comically dull edge were words in old Carcinain. They read, “This blade will do as well as any other.”
The message was clear: when the Empire comes knocking, you might as well defend yourself with a stick.
 The sight of the sword quieted what was left of the grumbling crowd. A few wept. They were outlaws and they killed, but what the Empire had done to them and their kind was another thing entirely. 
 “This man thought he could stroll right into Urgiz and present this sword to Lindrimuud. He was so sure of his power that he thought he could stroll right out again! Look at him now. Well, I shall not be the one to stand in your way, Oro Uro. This sword belongs to Lindrimuud, and since the Emporer sent you to give it to him, then damn it, you’ll give it to him. But -” he brought his face close to Oro’s, “- you’ll not be walking out like you planned.”</Text>

            <Text>‘Seen it amillion times. This man’s look. He’s no will to live.
Thats the burgeons he’s eaten. Man is high as the mountain.
Oh. But still.

‘Do you have any conception of eternity? Kuts on kuts. Eternity. Conssequences.’(mark zuckerberg) I feel like you’re not getting it. Give this to salavan as he hovers over pyetle.

When the world was pulled up from the waters it came out as a solid whole, one ocean surrounding one earth. When the sun rose it rose for everyone at once. Then it is said that Moon, in an attempt to prevent humanity from trampling his brother’s garden, smashed his fists into the ground and split the land in two. In one cataclysmic afternoon Jandria became an island continent. 
How great the trembling must have been when the Hias mountains were torn apart, when valleys once green were flooded by the onrushing ocean waves. How incredible it had to be to see all manner of fish and shark and whale tumble into the bottomless trench that Moon had opened up. But when Moon pushed Jandria out into the ocean he unwittingly pushed it closer to the sun. Thus the lush environs of the Jandri heartland withered and decayed to dust. In his bid to save the his brother’s garden from the ravages of humanity, Moon had destroyed it instead. To add insult to injury, humans made it over to Jandria anyways. 
 Most of these ancient settlers sailed around the Zosan horn to farm the banks of the Jade river, which was and is the best land in all the world. Early maps would dot their cities with silver leaf and would circle them with tiny drawings of doves alighting. Shogata, meanwhile, was nothing but a nameless black dot sitting halfway down the cursed Shalbrumont Strait - if it was dotted at all. Nobody cared for a small flesh market that merchant barges tried to skip as they plowed the Shalbrumont’s currents. This all changed when a young slave daughter slipped and fell into a hole. 
What that girl was doing in the foothills of the Hias mountains so far from the city only Sol knows. It is rumored that she had been feasting on moon burgeons and was caught in a dark trance. The rumors say she didn’t fall down into the abyss but willingly climbed in, after all, the hole in which she was found was nothing but a black sliver in the grass - they say you had to be led to it. But that’s all back matter, for what’s important is that when she was pulled from the earth her tattered hands were clutching a nugget of gold.
The shepherd who found her went back to that crack the next day with an oil lamp. Before he’d gotten twelve feet down his eye caught the glint of a gold stringer slanting down through the black granite. He shimmied down to it, followed it through another tight-fitting pocket, and there in that fractured bit of earth he found a webbed vein of gold that was wider than his arms could stretch. 
Mines poured into the hills. This was long before the times of Hrkkan science so no real thought was given to managing the uncountable tonnes of rock that was pressing down on the blooming network of tunnels. When the people of Shagota dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a stiffening mud, but that was it. They didn’t understand that the granite there was fiercely jointed and that a beam supporting one rock is doing nothing for another just a few inches away. The odd cave-in should have served as a warning. One might be tempted to say they were blinded by greed but that wasn’t true - they simply didn’t have the knowledge to see the danger. 
In time Shagota became a golden city on the maps of a golden age. Its thousand white domes were enameled with sacred geometry. Its boulevards were filled with all the peoples of the world. Its army was twice the size of any other. Its port was the very center of the earth. All this because of gold. Gold. As bright and as immutable as the divine; leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in your hands and you’ll be struck with a yearning akin to spiritual rapture, a yearning for more, for as much as you can get. 
Shagotans devoted their lives to its call. They followed the gold wherever the it went, and it went everywhere, even under the city itself. At the peak of the frenzy it would have been easier to map out the strips of remaining granite than to try to get a handle on the tunnelwork. 
Then one unlucky day a miner slammed his pick into the wrong hairline crack. He assumed he was far enough back from the waters of the Shabrumont, but as soon as his iron smacked the granite wall a jet of water shot out. In minutes the mines were flooded. When the bedrock fell the golden city above fell with it. 
More than five hundred thousand people were swallowed up by the earth. In those ancient times it was the greatest loss of life that had ever been recorded.
But humans are redoubtable creautes when gold is at hand, so it didn’t take long for the city to be rebuilt from scratch further south. Shagota the second swelled anew, though it would never be as grand as the first. Not nearly as grand, for whenever a nugget of gold was pulled from the earth it was stored in a porthouse before being shipped across the strait as fast as possible. Folks feared the earth might open up at any time to eat their treasures. Common sense demanded that the wealth would be better used elsewhere.
And so Shagota’s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren’t laid out with any sense, much less paved. These mucky avenues didn’t even adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they just plopped it down wherever. And these houses were ugly things, couldn’t even be called houses - they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls that were all askew. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like the city was one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had just happened to blow together.
Pyetle hadn’t seen Shagota in over three years. 
If he hadn’t eaten a bushel of south-valley burgeons on the way in the city would have been exactly how he remembered it - derelict and depressing. Instead, the burgeons had gotten him so high that he mistook the ramshackle cityscape for beauty. 
The rain was helping that vision along. It helped with the smell, at least. It wasn’t a drowning rain but a wispy rain that always seems to be on the verge of letting up, so it wasn’t too dark and dreary. For Pyetle it was even brighter than that because the burgeons had blown his pupils so wide open that the smallest ounce of light was enough to make things bright and glistening. To him, every surface sparkled. The very air around him dazzled. Cool muck welled up between his toes as he splashed along Shagota’s streets and this, too, seemed flecked with a radiant light.
Pyetle knew that this was more than just light playing with wetness. It seemed as if the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get them glommed up in between his fingertips and eat them. The longer he stopped and stared at one spot the more he became convinced that the burgeonsight was revealing to him the true nature of things, that a kind of oily celestial film coated all matter.
He lingered in the middle of an empty crossroad, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Shagota, each topped off with little nipple chimneys protruding from their roofs. Pyetle stood there motionless, back hunched, beard drenched, brown tunic slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of four clay pots set up against a peeling wall. 
Like everything else these pots were covered in that sparkling film, but the striking thing about them was that they weren’t wet. They couldn’t be wet because they were sheltered from the rain by an awning. Up until now, Pyetle had assumed that the dancing, sparkling light was just the burgeonsight exaggerating the natural world, the simple wetness of it, but those pots were dry. They shouldn’t have been sparkling. There was also a small grey pup shivering alongside them, a dry pup, and he was sparkling too. 
Then it occurred to Pyetle to look at his own skin, and sure enough, sparkling on top of his blood stained palm was that same substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off the back of his hand, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too. 
He knew that light from wetness rolls over a surface as the surface rolls around because that kind of light is just a reflection, but the bright sparkles Pyetle saw seemed stuck to his skin. They stayed put, moved with the skin instead of rolling over it. Sure, they rolled around a little but it seemed more like they were stuck to his skin.
Then he tried to taste them, so he put his fingers to his tongue. 
Immediately his mouth was flooded with a flavor he’d never known, like he’d just bit down on a juicy melon, only it didn’t taste like any melon at all. He couldn’t place the taste. Didn’t think it was possible. It should only be described by comparing it to abstract things. It tasted like the smell of a field of wildflowers. It was honey mixed with the the feeling of being young.
He squealed with delight. 
He bent down and scraped out a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again his mouth was flooded with that flavor. 
He rushed over to one of the clay pots, the dry ones, and made sure to lick it where the lightstuff was dancing with the most vibrancy, dancing on the red clay like an army of ants off to war. Again he tasted that divine flavor. Then he picked up the dog and licked its scruff, and there it was.
He squealed with delight. 
“OOHhh!”
“Get lost you freak!”
The disgust in that voice shook Pyetle so much that he dropped the pup and it scurried away. He pulled his knife and turned around, but there was no one there, nothing but glistening mud, soggy doors, wet thatching, and the sound of rain plunking off discarded tin. He couldn’t see the villager eyes peeping out at him, peeping out at an old skinny man standing there in the muck, knife drawn, having just licked the hide of a poor little pup like a maniac. Pyetle couldn’t see those eyes but he could damn well feel them. Each dark threshold might just as well have been a person leering out at him.
“You do not see what I see!” Pyetle shouted.
“Get lost!”
 Pytele shuddered and turned from side to side, his blade threatening each door as he did. Again he felt the need to defend his sanity.
“I see Sol’s light!”
“GET LOST!”
Pyetle yelped, for that shout seemed to come from just behind his ear. 
He took off running.
He ran and ran, following the road wherever it was going. He stopped when he realized that he was liable to slip and stab himself, so he put his knife away and paused, hands on his knees, to catch his breath. 
Straight ahead of him, a little ways off, was Shagota’s central hill. It rose over the rooftops and clumps of white buildings clung like barnacles to its cliffs. These were the various offices of government and the mansions of the people who staffed them. Chief among them was the house of Salavan Saran. It claimed a privileged vista set above the hill’s cliff face. Its balconies leered over the rest of the city below, over Pyetle. Its magnificent walls and stout columns dared Pyetle to just try it. 
Pyetle set off at a determined trot. Along the way he stole a blue ragged sash that someone was letting wash in the rain. In his mind it wasn’t stealing because he filled its spot on the laundry line with the Soreel’s leather scabbard. He wouldn’t need it. His plan was to roll Soreel’s knife up in the sash and tie it around his waist. 
Once he’d gotten the sash knotted up he found that if he bent forward a bit then the bulge of the knife’s handle would get lost amongst the folds. So he walked that, stooping a little, all the way up Shagota’s hill. After a while he came upon Salavan’s gate.
There were two guards in front of it, stationed on either side of the wide wooden doors. They were thoroughly disgusted at their lot, having to stand in the rain, so disinterested in doing their duty that Pyetle wondered if couldn’t have just held the knife in his hand and been let in. The two men had been told to expect him, so they moved to let him through the gate without so much as glance as soon as he told them his name. 
The opening of the gate triggered a bell on the other side of the wall. The sound of it ringing entranced Pyetle, and as the gate opened his jaw opened with it, struck as it were by the sight of Salavan’s brilliant garden. Like the rest of the world it was shimmering, but there were vibrant colors too. Exotic plants and flowers and trees. And Salavan was there, sheltered in his grand portico, sitting, waiting. The sound of the entrance bell had drawn his attention to Pyetle. 
“Pyetle, my friend! Come in, come in!”
Salavan was a tall, large man. Easily twice Pyetle’s size. too, and rich enough to be wrapped in a yellow silk robe replete with roses embroidered in pink. He standing on his stoop, out of the rain, and beckoned Pyetle inside. 
“I was beginning to wonder if you were coming,” Salavan said. “Marta and the girls are out, so it’s just us.”
“I hope Marta was able cook a little something before she left,” Pyetle said as he stomped up the wide portico stairs to where Salavan was standing.
“Yes, yes, I told her you were on the way,” Salavan said with a chuckle. “She finished a few pot-stickers before she left, just for you.” 
“Your wife is divine.”
“Indeed she is. But where is Soreel?” 
Pyetle paused to remove his sandals, then stuck his feet out into the rain to rid them of mud. 
“I don’t know. She said she’d meet me up here, but I haven’t seen her.”
 “She said that? Well that’s no matter. How are you? Haven’t seen you in years! You’re not drunk already?”
“A little, sure.” said Pyetle.
Pyetle’s eyes were red and witless, his nose was runny, and his mouth seemed as if it were stuck in a permanent sigh.
Salavan gave Pyetle a practiced but insincere look of concern. Pyetle was too weak to be of any real concern.
“You’re soaking and muddy,” Salavan said, “Let me get you washed up. A towel and some clothes.”
Pyetle tried to brush him off. “No, no, that’s fine. I won’t be long.”
“Nonsense, I insist.” Salavan said.
“I won’t be long.”
“Pyetle, I don’t care about you being dirty, I care about my floors being dirty.” He clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out with a lump of soap, a scrub, and a towel. 
Salavan made sure the boy gave Pyetle’s arms and legs a good scrubbing, then made the boy fetch a tunic. Once Pyetle was dried and changed, wearing the same dull garb that the boy was, he was ushered into the main hall.
As if an honored position on Shagota’s Hill were not enough, Salavan’s home was the one of the largest around, certainly its opulence was second to none. It had cost Salavan three siver-strings of imported lumber just to burn enough lime to make enough plaster to coat the massive walls. The rare paints for the fresco that wrapped around the interior atrium took another fortune more - though it was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Sol at the very moment of his apotheosis - the sun-god was laid out across the eastern wall, wearing a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as he plunged it into his brother’s back.
“To business then!” Salavan exclaimed. He clapped Pyetle on the shoulder and led him towards the staircase which climbed up to the second floor, where dinner awaited. 
“Pyetle, you know I’ve been impressed with how you’ve handled things, considering the circumstances. Lesser men would be looking for someone to blame. Blame the Gods. You could have even blamed me.”
“Blamed you?”
“You know, small men, they delight in nuturing resentment against the man who buys them. That’s all they have, really.”
“Oh. That doesn’t sound like me.”
“Quite right. That’s what I’m saying. You’re a good man, and a good man never dwells on failure. It’s on to the next opportunity.”
 “No, no, no,” Pyelte said. “That’s not why it doesn’t matter.”
 “Oh?”
“It’s the wife.”
“Ah, I see. Business can wait, I suppose.”
“I really thought she would... I mean… I took her to the Fordwell, and really, it was so beautiful. Sol could have descended in a cloud right then and there to give us a blessing. I mean it was a beautiful day.”
“So is today - in it’s own way.” 
The second floor of Salavan’s house had a high ceiling and high windows that offered a stunning view of the storm outside. By now, the rains had started to move on, and they made room for Sol’s golden light to shift into pink and purple pastels as it played on the city and the clouds all around. 
Common to the fashion of the Solean elite, the furnishings of Salavan’s second story were muted and tasteful so as to pick up Sol’s light. Here the floor was covered in massive rugs that were subtly patterned with white lilies and were trimmed with glittering gold ropes. They served as giant picture frames for the colors that Sol cast upon them. On top were pillows upon pillows for comfort, all white with gold tassels and ivory lace threading them together. In one corner, the floor had been hollowed out to accommodate a hefty hotstone. It was heated by the kitchen below and a burning brazier above. It was already portioned with meats. At the sides of the stone were reclining chairs made of rope strung into angled ebony frames. Pyetle sighed as he reclined into his, then munched on a potsticker that he had pulled from the hotstone. 
Half an hour ago, the rain was cold and overwhelming. Now, it was a cozy and soothing murmur set against the warm light of the brazier.
“Claire has been the hardest bit for me,” Pyetle said in between bites. “The drought, the fields, this cursed storm that’s going to ruin the land… I can handle those. But her… Twenty-two years… Its the kind of thing when you lose, its gone forever.”
“You two aren’t separating, are you?”
“She was cheating on me, Salavan.”
“Oh?”
Pyetle pauses as the emotion wells up.
“Pyetle, you’re in a tragic spot and I’m sorry for that,” Sal said as he lit up a wrap of freeweed. His great bulk was still settling into his chair. “But, I’ve got to be honest - I can’t relate to what you are going through. I’ve heard stories of loves-lost and loves-lorn and I’ve tasted it a little, but, well you know that Marta and I were kids when we were married.”
“I know.”
“So,” Sal said before taking a long drag from his wrap, “I can give you financial and business advice, but what you need right now, I can’t give it to you.”
Pyetle bit into another potsticker. He savored the sweet peach sauce in which the shredded chicken had been baked.
“This is so good,” he said. “If only I could steal Marta from you.”
“You are certainly welcome to try,” Sal said, smiling.
“I suppose I would fail.” Pyetle moaned. “At this point, I would have to pay for it if I wanted intimacy.” 
“Pyetle...”
“It’s this face. This damned body. Like my father’s - I don’t understand how he ever got a woman to stick with him.”
“Claire’s not that shallow. Besides, your father was richer than I am.”
“It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter,“ Pyetle asserted, eager not to be distracted from his pity. 
Sal took another drag from his wrap before continuing on to his point. “Just settle for a woman that will have you for your money. You’ve not got much of it left, but any little bit of money out here can go a good ways. Money has a way of motivating a person to look deeper into a Being. First she’ll have you for your money, and I trust, in time, she’ll have you for you.” 
“I’ve been married to Claire for thirteen years, Sal. If that wasn’t long enough to… wait, are you saying I should move on already?”
Sal leaned back in his ornamented chair and folded his hands across his stomach. “You’ve spent your whole life getting what you want in the way that you want it, Pyetle, except this one thing. You’re spoiled - no, that’s not fair - You’re stubborn. Women of consequence, women like Claire, they pick up on that as soon as you open your mouth. No one wants to be stuck with a stubborn ass for a lifetime.”
“I guess so.”
Pyetle’s flippancy was disturbing. Sal looked down his nose at the broken man, and in the flickering firelight he caught the glimmer of tears streaking down Pyetle’s face. Sal looked away in disgust, and caught sight of the horizon. There, Sol’s light was dimming, the rain was letting up, and through it he could make out the evening song of Swassel birds drifting in on a cool breeze. The mood would have been delightful if it weren’t for Pyetle’s sorrow clouding the room.
“Have some freeweed,” Sal demanded.
“No.”
“Pyetle, I may not know the depths of your sadness -” Salavan said with a sarcastic bite, “but I’ve had my share of sadness in general, and a wrap of freeweed blunts its edge. It’s the only thing I can offer you. Take it.”
Pyetle wiped his eyes with the palm of his hand and tried to compose himself before taking a wrap from the tray near him. He then stood up to light it in the fire that burned above the hotstone.
 “I think this is it for me,” Pyetle said as he rolled the tip of the wrap in the flame. “I’m done. I’m finally done with it all. I’m going to do it.”
“What do you mean?” Sal asked.
“You’re going to make me say it?”
“Say what?”
Pyetle simply smiled, turned his chair to face Salavan, and sat back down to nurse his freeweed and glare at Salavan.
“Well, I’m sure you’ve considered all alternatives. I don’t need to remind you that in the eyes of the Gods killing yourself is the same as killing any other.”
“Alternatives...”
“Did you ever get to hear old Pella Germin preach?”
“I don’t go in for that.”
“I heard her preach once. She said that we are expected to kill ourselves.”
“Did she?”
“She said something like, ‘Corruption is a stain that does not wash off. To be free of it, to achieve peace, you must first kill yourself.’”
“You were there when she preached this?”
“I was. For a while I marked it as the ravings of a Dreamer, especially considering what came of her. But, in time, I saw some wisdom in it. Perhaps I put the wisdom there, but it felt like I found it. So tell me, have you tried killing yourself? Figuratively, I mean.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“It means, try living for a little bit as if Pyetle Andramawmun were dead.”
“That’s a bit heretical, isn’t it?”
“No, no, no. Follow me here. From this moment on, Pyetle is dead, and residing inside this fleshy vessel is whoever you want to put in there.”
“If it were possible... Well, what? I should just pretend I’m not me? I don’t think it works that way.”
 Sal leaned forward. The freeweed was working its energy into him. “Your broken heart is there because you put it there. Pyetle put it there. If you kill Pyetle, he can no longer stop you from throwing away his treasure.”
“I put it there?”
 “Yes! You must see that.”
“I should blame myself for what other people have done to me?”
 “You take no responsibility?”
 “I’d sooner blame you, Sal.”
 “Me?”
“What? You didn’t think I’d find out?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Salavan, I saw you two fucking.”
The accusation fell like a hammer blow, it flattened out the mood and stunned Salavan into silence. He narrowed his eyes, sat back in his chair, and glared at Pyetle while the moment passed between them. Only when it was good and gone did he grunt and snarl and huff and say , “I see.”
 Pyetle leapt up out of his chair, his face flushed and his limbs tight with purpose. He reached into his tunic for his knife.
It wasn’t there.
He had left it with his wet clothes downstairs. 
“You’re so god-damned stupid,” Salavan said, “You’re looking for this?” 
He took Pyetle’s knife out of his own pocket.
“You know I was wondering about this - I know you’re one of those loony Dreamer types who never travel armed, and so I wondered… but I thought you were just going to kill yourself. But my! How could I forget - you’re an ambitious man!”
He stood up. The great bulk of him dwarfed Pyetle. 
Pyetle’s knees almost buckled. 
“You know, I’m impressed,” Salavan continued. “Perhaps now you realize the strength of your own Will. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it - the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing? And now here you are! Doing it! Well, you tried to. It’s the attempt I admire.” He took a step forward. “But here, let me show you how it’s done.” 
Pyetle turned to run, but Salavan kicked out at his feet. It was enough to knock a drunken Pyetle to the carpet. 
Salavan pounced.
 “Hold still, Pyetle! Hold still!”
“Stop! Help!”
Salavan used his great strength to wrestle Pyetle’s flailing limbs into submission, and used his weight to squeeze the air from Pyetle’s lungs. He delighted in the pitiful sound that Pyetle made as he wheezed. 
 “Did you ever dream of committing murder?” Salavan asked. He put the knife up against Pyetle’s throat. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this? It’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan peered into Pyetle’s gasping mouth. “Yes, I can see it!” Salavan exclaimed with glee. “Hah! I can see it there inside of you now! The way everything is squirming in there.” He set the knife’s blunt edge against Pyetle’s tongue and pressed down. “Yes! Gods, you really fucked this up Pyetle. When you pass on into the Hell, that should be your final thought, that this is all your fault.”
Tears streamed down Pyetle’s face and his lungs burned in agony. Salavan paused his ramblings to delight in the picture. 
“There’s no greater feeling,” he muttered.
As Pyetle’s vision started to blur, he thought he could see something at the window - a shadow of a figure. It pulled itself up and into the room. It was shrouded and skinny and tall, absolutely massive, nearly the height of the ceiling. 
Pyetle thought that Death incarnate had come. His time was at an end.
Salavan screamed.
“EAAAUUUGHHH!” 
The knife fell from Pyetle’s mouth and Salavan tumbled off him to the floor.
Pyetle coughed and spat and wriggled up against the wall. When his vision cleared he saw that Salavan’s arm was struck with an arrow. At the window was a man, a giant man, taller than even Salavan by at least a foot. At his side was a massive bow. He knocked another arrow.
“Thief! Brigand!” Salavan yelled, clutching at his pierced arm. He scrambled to his feet and ran towards the stairs, but he stopped when he saw that it was blocked by another hooded figure. 
“Hill!?” 
A short, squat man all wrapped in black ascended the stairs. He held a scimitar in his hand, and pointed it towards Salavan’s fat belly. 
“Hill, what are you doing here?” Salavan asked.
“You know why. No games,” Hill said. His speech was thick with a southern Jandrian lilt.
“Take what you will and be gone!” Salavan shouted, but Hill ignored him. Instead, he pointed with his sword to the giant at the window.
“Do you know who is he?” 
Salavan twisted round. He had never seen a man as broad or as tall, but he had heard stories. This could only be the famous Giant of the Junei. “You’re Ayram.”
“Yes, he is Ayram.” Hill walked round to where Ayram stood. He gave quick glance to Pyetle, who sat frozen on a heap of pillows. “Ayram is boss, and you make me look bad.” Hill poked Salavan in the stomach with his sword and then cut the knot which held Salavan’s robe together. It fell apart to reveal a large, hairy belly.
“What are you talking about? 
“Ayram trust me, I trust you, you betray me, it look like I betray Ayram.”
“Betray you?”
“No games.”
“Dammit Hill! At least tell me what you think I did.” He turned to plead with Ayram. “Ayram, Ayram whatever this cretin told you about me -”
Hill lashed out with his sword-arm and cut Salavan’s belly. It wasn’t deep, but the speed and shock of it put Salavan off balance.
“You little demon!” he roared. 
Hill just tut-tutted and shook his head.
“You no talk to Ayram,” he said. “You deal with me. You broke my trust.”
“Whatever you think it is that I did - I didn’t.”
“Fine. We play game.” Hill lashed out again and cut an X into Salavan’s belly.
“STOP! Hill! Just tell me what the Hell is going on!”
“You give me bad information. I give it to Ayram. My friends die. You deny this?”
“What? You think I set you up?”
“You didn’t?”
Salavan shook his head. “Hill, you fucking idiot. Why the Hell would I do that?”
“That is why we be here. To find out.”
“Hill… Ayram... You people are more valuable to me than anything. I would never betray you or whatever it is you think. Go ahead! Take whatever you want. There’s no need for this.”
Hill took a step towards Ayram. His face passed into deadly seriousness.
“The call on that caravan - where you get it?”
“I’m the exchequer for the mining guild. I have access to all of the -”
“That wasn’t a mining column.”
“Yes it was.”
“That was Imperial cavalry.”
“Imperial cavalry? I pointed you towards a Sheldri company caravan. Seventy-two hands. Five wagons. ”
“Seventy two, yes. Five, yes. But one Seilsi. You left that out.”
“What?”
“There was a Seilsi.”
Salavan stumbled over his next words. “A - a Seilsi? What would a Seilsi be doing with -”
“Stop.”
“I have no -”
“I say stop.”
“But I have no -”
Hill plunged his sword into Salavan’s thigh. Salavan doubled over then crumpled down to the ground. His blood dripped on to the carpet, and it spread out over the intricate gold patten and soaked deep into the white fibers. 
“Please! Please!”
Hill pulled out his sword and slapped Salavan’s side with it.
“You a big man, Sal.” Hill said. “Ayram, how many he can take?”
Ayram stood still, towering over the scene, stroking his beard with his fingers. He did not respond.
Hill tilted his head from side to side as he appraised Salavan’s great bulk, then he poked it with his finger to test its firmness.
“Very fat. I can cut it all off if you like?”
“Hill…”
“Yes?”
“Let me do some asking. If what you say is true -”
“You doubt the Truth?”
“No! No. Just let me do some asking. I was set up, same as you.”
“You really not know?”
“I didn’t! I swear to the Gods I didn’t!”
Hill looked at Ayram. He nodded.
Hill lifted his sword above Salavan’s head.
“Wait,” Ayram said. “Let the little man do it.”
All three of them looked at Pyetle. 
“Pyetle, right?” 
Pyetle nodded.
Ayram walked over and picked up Pyetle’s knife. He stood close enough that Pyetle, looking up, could see his face. The brazier’s fire lit it up from underneath so that his sunken cheeks cast shadows over his eyes. Pyetle could feel his glare digging into him, digging right through his own eyes and into his mind, into his soul, even. 
“Do what you came here to do,” Ayram said. He held out Pyetle’s knife. It seemed like a toothpick in his massive, calloused palm.
“I’m… I’m not…”
Ayram smiled. “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I heard the whole thing. You’re a man after my own heart, Pyetle. He deserves it. Let me help you.”
He reached down and grabbed Pyetle’s upper-arm then lifted him up like a child and set him onto his feet. His tight grip seemed so rigged with strength and vigor that Pyetle thought he might snap the bone with an easy squeeze - but Ayram wasn’t rough. With a paternal touch he guided Pyetle along to where Salavan knelt, and then placed the knife in Pyetle’s hand. 
“Go on.” 
Salavan cowered in the flickering firelight, bleeding all over, eyes stuck wide with fear. His heavy breathing was the loudest thing in the room. Pyetle no longer saw him as a man, as an enemy, but an animal - just meat and bone and terror. He expected Salavan to plead for mercy. He even hesitated to wait for it. When it didn’t come he almost asked Salavan if he wanted it, and in his excited mood he might have given it, but his lips quivered and sank and he put the knife up to Salavan’s throat. 
“A last thought, Salavan?”
Sweat beaded down the sides of Salavan’s face. He glanced round the room - over to Hill, up to Ayram, and when his eyes settled at last on Pyetle he furrowed his brow and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could get out a word Pyetle split his throat.
Salavan fell forward, face down into the carpet. He gargled and gasped, one arm clutching his throat, one pulling on Pyetle’s tunic. Pyetle tried to swipe it away, but Salavan’s grip was still strong. As Pyetle staggered back he dragged Salavan along so that his body painted a bloody swath across the rug. Finally, Pyetle slashed at Salavan’s arm with his knife and that was enough to get rid of it.
In a few moments, after a few spasms, Salavan was dead. His sprawling corpse and in his pooling blood was neatly framed by the rectangle of the rug’s golden trim. His head was even placed on a perfect third, drawing the eye. It was as if Sol had composed the canvas himself so that His twilight could play over the gruesome scene with the firelight, affirming to all who were present His majesty, His Will, .
Salavan, at least, had come to a poetic end.

“Somebody’s coming.”
Ayram bounded over to the window and drew his bow.
“The wife.”
“Hold it!” Pyetle yelled. “Hold it!”
Both Hill and Ayram looked back at Pyetle for an explanation.
“She’s done nothing wrong!”
“Nothing you know,” said Hill.
“She doesn’t deserve to die,” Pyetle pleaded.
“Deserved to be made a widow, though?” Ayram asked.
Pyetle looked down at his feet. Ayram laughed and loosened his draw. “No worries, my little drunk man. No worries. Come, let us depart.” 
Hill jumped out of the window and into evening sky. Ayram tossed Pyetle down after him, then leapt along beside. The each scurried into the shadow of the wall. Hill moved like mouse, and Ayram seemed to be shadow himself. Pyetle stumbled along and nearly gave them away as Salavan’s wife, Marta, and her two girls made their way up the stoop.
The two brigands circled around behind and out the gate, and Pyetle followed along as best he could. Twice, out in the street, he lost track of them. Drunk as he was it wasn’t hard, but even sober it would have been difficult; Hill and Ayram were nearly as one with shadow and the shadows grew long as the sun had begun to set. When Ayram doubled back the second time he took a hold of Pyetle’s wrist and did not let go again for the rest of the journey through Jeket’s streets and alleys. 
Pyetle was content to be led. He only needed to keep his feet moving. He didn’t want to work. He didn’t want to think. He wanted only to cry and to be done with it. When at last they came to a stop inside of a secluded shrine to the Dreamer, he collapsed to his knees and begged to left alone. When Hill opened the door to a little crypt behind the Dreamer’s eye, Ayram picked Pyetle up and carried him under his arm. 
Hill lit a torch. Inside the shrine there were three plain stone sarcophagi. Hill kicked the lid of the center one open. Pyetle peered into and was surprised to see that there wasn’t a mummified corpse, there was a hole. 
“What is that?” he asked.
“The way out.” Hill said.
“Where does it lead?” 
“It be the Underworld?”
“The Underworld?” Pyetle asked in a frightened whisper. “Here? A passage down is here?”
“They’re everywhere,” Ayram said. “You just have to know where to look.”
At that he tossed Pyetle down into the hole, then dived in after him.


 Ayram interrogating Salaman,
&quot;I’m trying to figure out why you told me it was gold out there. You know what I’m trying to do out here. You know I’d jump at the chance to take out a Mazydei. So when I was knocked out by his blast of power, you know what I was dreaming about for two days? Why would Salavan lie to me about it? Why tip me off to a shipment of gold that isn’t there, and instead lead me into the lion’s den?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Salavan said, fawning. “You’re here, you killed him! It’s all good! Good!”
“I can only think of two reasons why you’d set me up.”
“Set you up? No! No. Set up the Imperial scum, sure. Not you.”
“But you could have told me. I might not have lost thirty Ayramun that way.”
“Thirty Ayramun? Forgive me, Ayram. Forgive for saying, with all due respect, that thirty Ayramun is a small price to pay for killing one of the nine, no?”
Ayram gets real close, as if to show by his sheer size that he wasn’t afraid of anything. The mere suggestion that Salavan was up to things Ayram wasn’t was an inslut.
“They were Ayramun, Salavan. They were me. You’ve a blood debt to pay.”
Ayram motions to Hill, who gave shrill whistle. Then Salavan’s family came marching up the stairs.
Horror in their faces.
“Tell me why you set me up. You figured the Mazydei would kill me?”
“Kill you? Nonsense. Impossible.”
“What was it then? Why not just tell me I was up against a Mazydei. You wanted to make sure I killed the beast instead of taking him captive? I think you know they’re worth more to me alive than dead. That’s the only other thing that makes sense here - that he knew something about something and you didn’t want to risk it getting to me.”
“Take a Mazydei captive? Nonsense. They’re too powerful to be -“
Salavan’s words were cut short by a knife to the neck.
“I’m only going to ask you this once: What’s going on that you don’t want me to know about?”
Salavan glances down at the blade.
“Oh, this knife here, not going kill you with it. See there’s a knife just like it up against your wife’s neck. Just want you to feel the edge like she’s feeling it. Same shock of fear. Maybe it will sober you up and come clean.”
“You’re… You’re going to kill her anyways.”
“Yes, but Salavan… because of your lifestyle,” and he stressed the word ‘lifestyle’ as his eyes cast about the room with a disapproving glare, “I don’t expect you to really feel the weight of what I’m about to say, but not all deaths are the same.” 
Ayram could read the confusion writtin on Salavan face, his gibbering lips.
“I’ve seen people die in seconds. I’ve seen people suffer years of torment. And it’s not just a matter of time. I’ve seen people suffer years in seconds.”



Salavan is like, pyetle! Didn’t expect to see you! Where’s soreel? Whats the secret to your beer. I hear its date syrup, but every time I put it in, its got this sweet, cloying taste that coats the tongue and its terrible.


A high, stuccoed wall shielded Salavan’s courtyard from the world, and two guards were standing at the gate. Pyetle walked up them, told them who he was, and they let him in. By now his sparkling vision was beginning to fade.

He knew he wanted to kill Salavan. After that, he had only to decide how he wanted to die. The most poetic end would be to wander down one of the thief infested alleys near the Heberdee Gate - one final stab in the back would be fitting.

Moto believed in liberalism. Multiculturalism. Peace. But willingness of people to fight for that right against bullies. Saw the slaughter of Virineez (Ukraine). The Hrkans were literally funding both sides. Virineez got slaughtered. They encouraged them to stand up for themselves, then sat back. He still believes in it, but Hrk has no principle.

Coupled with

Jovan divjak
Divjak, as an ethnic Serb, was made a general in order to present a multiethnic character of the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina. He himself commented on the issue by saying that he felt like a &quot;flower arrangement&quot; and said that &quot;of course, someone has to be a flower arrangement too&quot;. He expressed that it was shameful if his service to the army were only temporary. Indeed, he and Stjepan Šiber (as a Croat) were the only non-Bosniaks in the Chief of Staff. Both of them were offered retirement in March 1996 by the Chairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Alija Izetbegović. At the beginning of the war, out of 18 percent of Croats and 12 percent of Serbs, only one percent of both remained in the ranks of the Bosnian army. Divjak complained about that to Rasim Delić, then a Chief of Staff, as well as Izetbegović, but it was explained that it was because &quot;Bosniak soldiers didn't trust the Serb commanders.&quot; Divjak was later excluded by Delić from the decision making process in the Army. The Bosniaks in the Army allegedly had no confidence in Serb commanders according to Oslobođenje.[5]

Importance of river ecology.

About half the crew setting off in different direction. All the Ferzans + some others. 
“They aren’t coming. There’s too many Kackle trees over there.”
“What’s wrong with Kackle trees?”
“They’re shade-givers. They’re afraid them.”
“Ferzans are afraid of shade?”
“They love shade. It’s the trees they’re afraid of. They think the trees spread out like that and give so much shade to lure desperate creatures in. They think the trees release a poison into the air that kills whatever’s sitting under it.”
“Do they? I’ve sat under Kackle trees all my life.”
“No, they don’t. I can’t prove it, but, they don’t. But most Ferzans think the trees are trying to kill them. They think the roots feast on the bones once they’ve sunk into the earth.”
“That can’t be right.”
“It’s part of their whole deal. I’m not too sure to be honest. Hard to get it out of them. But they won’t go near Kackle trees.”
“It doesn’t make sense. Trees aren’t even living things.”
“Of course they are. They move. Living things are things that move. They don’t move move, but they grow. That’s a kind of movement.”
“Movement isn’t what makes a thing alive. Rocks move.”
“I’m not talking about falling, or rolling down hill. Trees move on their own. They’re trying to do things. Shows they have souls.”
“I’m not talking about falling either. Have you ever been to the Sassa salt plain? The ground there is flat as can be for miles. There’s no rain. Dry as can be. No? Well I’ve walked across it, right across the middle of it. There’s rocks there, some small, some about a meter long, and sure, when you walk by them they’re still as can be, but they’ve got trails running behind them through the salt. They’re moving. Slowly, imperceptibly, maybe decades to move an inch, but they’re moving.”
“You’re lying.”
“I’m not lying. Rocks move. You haven’t heard of Sassa?”
Mandrameen shook his head.
“Well it’s there. The Sassa salt plain. About forty leagues west of Chunran. You should go and see it before you get all assured in your narrow definition of Life. I’m telling you, listen to an old man, it’s not as simple as movement.”
“What is it then?”
“It’s children. Living things have children. If a thing has a child, then it’s alive. If it doesn’t, it’s not.”
“That doesn’t make sense. You said that trees aren’t alive, but trees have children.”
“They don’t.”
“You sure about that?”
“Well, no, but… well it seems to me that trees, plants, they just make copies of themselves. It’s a static kind of thing. There’s no life.”
“That just seems absurd.”
“Why’s that?”
“Look… I don’t know. I don’t really think about this kind of stuff.”
“I’m telling you, it’s the children. Sex is part of it. If the things have sex, they’re alive.”
“It’s not the sex, it’s the killing,” Mazyd interjected.
They look at Mazyd like, wtf bro.
“If you call it life,” Mazyd continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. You can crush a rock with a hammer and you can crush a bug with your thumb, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. That the cost of maintaining a soul - it’s the killing and then the eating.” That last word rolled through Mazyd’s beard like a saw.
“I hadn’t thought about that aspect of it,” Pyetle said.
“Makes sense from a Ferzan point of view. Trees are alive, so they’ve got to be killing something, no?”
“Yes,” Mazyd said, “Maybe all trees are killing us, slowly. Maybe that’s why we age. They’re releasing invisible poison into the air and we’re breathing it, right now we’re breathing it, and its making us age. We age, we die, we’re buried in the earth, and that’s when they feast on our bones. Maybe if it weren’t for trees we would be immortal.”
“What do you mean, ‘we’. You’re not human. You know, I know what you’re doing. I don’t like you. I’m not a barbarian so I’m not going to rough you up for the sake of it, but if I was, I would. So don’t talk.”
“Maybe he’s right,” Pyetle said. “There are stories of desert hermits, holy folk, living for hundreds of years.”
Bullo scrunched up his cheeks and said, “Now that is not true.”
“You seem certain,” Mazyd said. “But how can you be sure?”
Bullo looked at Mazyd with a fire. “What did I just say?”
“You said not to talk,” Mazyd answered, “but you also said you wouldn’t rough me up. You neutered your command as soon as you gave it.”
“Do you want me to hit you?” Bullo asked.
Mazyd’s diminutive form.
Mazyd looked at him and said, simply, “No.”



“Life? Everything is alive, because everything is connected. Everything is the same thing. Think about it. Just because you can think about something as being by itself, in a void, dosn’t mean you should. We’re here, sitting here, but we’re together, we’re sitting on the ground. We require this food, this earth, and earth requires us. Look at what we’ve done to it. It’s all the same thing. Nothing exist in a void. It all exists together. Thinking any other way, and your just playing with yourself. Like the barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? Pointless to think about. It’s just a word game.”

            <Text>
	The Sand is webbed by a network of byways that are hardly there at all. They’re not well traveled, and most are so windswept that footprints get filled back up with sand as soon as they’ve been made. These roads are only distinguished from the desert landscape by a series of five-ton waystones that stick up three meters out of the ground. If those gleaming white beams of rock weren’t there every league or so, you’d never know that under your feet was an ancient Jandrian route. 
	Pilgrims call them Charnel Roads because unlike the highways which keep to the river banks or hop between oases, these roads cut through the vast shadeless expanse of the Sand. Travelers get exposed to the sun, the wind, and the glare of the desert. The longer the road the deadlier it all is, though that’s just a rule of thumb because the worst Charnel Road, the Bazul Road, is one of the shortest. It sits just north of Uncharted Portion where an ancient mountain range once stood. An eon of blasting sand had reduced those mountains to a rolling line of graveled hills, flat enough for the Bazul Road to snake up and down them, and to lead pilgrims to the greater shrine of Bazul. It only takes a full day to make the road if you start at the nearest Imperial outpost at Shahiz, but its such a difficult hike, and Pilgrims sweat so much from just the effort that the heat on top of it is unbearable. And it’s a saturating heat, too, because the chalky gravel underfoot is white as bone so it throws the sunlight right back up into the face. You get baked from below as much as from above. Can’t even hide in your own shadow.
 	There is some shade on route: a little wood-frame waystation at a saddlepoint. The monks of Bazul keep it stocked with a cache of water buried in jugs. Some pilgrims sleep there in the day and make the road at night, skipping the sun altogether, but Solitant pilgrims don’t use it. They don’t trivialize the journey. They set out for the shrine in the morning and trudge through the brunt of it at midday. They do it, they say, because if Bazul did not intend for them to suffer, he would have set his earthly dwelling down on some oated knoll at the mouth of a Jeketian inlet. No, Bazul’s road was there in the Sand because Bazul put it there, and to skip this test of faith against flesh is to have no faith at all. This is the first lesson the road teaches the Solitant: the greatest temptation one must fight is the temptation to not try at all.
	Once a pilgrim actually gets on the road the temptations start to give way to the struggle. There are still a few urges to deal with, a few spiritual lessons learn. For example, there’s urge to stop and sit, to rest. Anywhere else in the world it would be a fine thing to do, but sitting down on a Charnel Road without shade is a mistake because the sun still bakes you even if you’re not moving. It will bake you tomorrow, too, so don’t saddle tomorrow’s self with today’s journey.
	Solitants savor this particular ordeal because it highlights two important lessons: doom finds you much quicker than death, and doing nothing is the same as doing the wrong thing. Nowhere else in the world are these principles so clear. Out on a Charnel Road, a man, sitting down, with no aches or pains and a full waterskin, is still moving towards the point of no return. This is the the inescapable consequence of Time: inaction is action itself, and for the Solitant, it is a refusal of the Divine gift of Will. 
	It is important to note that the Solitant word for doomed is ‘Shiskason’, and it doesn’t mean ‘doomed’ exactly. Unlike ‘doomed’ it carries an air of blame, not fate. It reads roughly like, ‘thing-that-you-did-not-prevent’. This gets to the heart of the Solitant religion: all creatures are naturally immortal, but every creature dies because every uncouth mistake ages the soul, every missed opportunity for righteousness draws another line in the face. If only people made the right decisions at every step they would live forever, but we’re all too ignorant, too dumb, and too lazy, so the weight of our failures literally kill us. Here, a pilgrim becomes a Shiska for no other reason than he stopped and he sat and he did not walk the road.
	 This cosmology is woven into the Solitant’s yellow haircloth habit. The constant itch is a constant reminder to never waste time. It keeps one alert and attentive to even the smallest opportunity to exercise Will. Of course, this creates another temptation pilgrims must fight on the Charnel Roads: the temptation to cast the scratchy habit aside. Not only does it itch, but the heat gets underneath it. The urge to take it off, to get the heat out and let the sweaty skin breathe is ever present. It’s here that the body starts to bargain with the mind, “Just take it off for a little while,” it pleads. “No one is watching. No one would know.” Pilgrims don’t ever do it, though. It’s a familiar temptation. Not only would they be casting aside their symbol of devotion, they’d actually be making it easer for the sun to sap their bodies of moisture and energy. 
	Its not the temptations, its the physical struggle that does most pilgrims in. On the Bazul road a twisted ankle or a tweaked knee is all but inevitable. Man’s upright gait just isn’t designed for a sustained trudge uphill through loosely packed gravel. No pilgrim has ever made the journey without stumbling a time or two, and when they fall their hands and feet get cut because the gravel isn’t smooth like riverstone, it’s been chipped unevenly by the wind and the sand. It’s got points and edges, some as sharp as blades.
	Solitant monks are used to fighting through physical pain, but nonetheless, it slows them down and gives the sun time to work delirium into them. At that point if they make a mistake with water, they’re dead, and it’s an easy mistake to make for any Solitants that come from across the northern sea. They don’t know what the sun can do to a body with just a few hours. When these foreigners come to the Bazul Road, all they hear is that its only a days journey. One day’s journey. Only twenty leagues. Sure, they hear stories about the deaths, but they shrug them off because such stories are never accurate. Carnage is always embellished. Three water-skins should be enough. 
	It’s hard to get experience traveling in the Sand, because getting experience means you’ve got to survive your mistakes. The first time a person pricks her water-skin on the half-buried thorn of a karkel-bush seed pod is the last time. There’s just no room for error, and dying in the Sand isn’t a pleasant way to go. If the heat takes you quick its not so bad, but if it doesn’t, if you’ve rationed water well enough to die slowly, then your mouth dries out and your tongue swells up and your eyes lose their moisture and start to scratch. Then a thumping nausea works its way out from your head and into your stomach and then into your marrow’s jelly. It’s no coincidence that almost every corpse found on a Charnel Road is found curled up like fetus against the agony, though not many corpses are found because a pack of lizards can eat a full adult male in a just few hands, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you might still be alive when they do it.

Shade giving trees  they don’t like. Kills them. Fall asleep under it and you don’t wake up. They think they’re killers. We keep them up because they keep scandri away. 
“They aren’t coming. Too many kekle trees.”
“What’s wrong with kackle trees?”
“They’re shade giving trees. They’re afraid them.”
“Trees don’t have souls. Trees aren’t even living things.”
Dan gives Ralph a look.
“If you call it life,” Ralph continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. I can crush a rock with my hammer and I can crush a bug with my hammer, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. It’s the killing and the eating.” That last word rolled through Ralph’s beard like a saw.
“What about children?”
“Trees eat children?”
“Fuck, no… Definition of life. Bugs have children, rocks don’t. That’s what makes a bug alive.”
“Cut a man’s balls off, what is he then? Dead? Just because he can’t have children?”
“He’s of a type that has children.”
Ralph just shrugged. “I say it’s killing. If these trees are alive, then that means they’re killing something. Could be it’s us. I heard once that we’re supposed to be immortal, and that the trees are poisoning the air to age us, so they can feast on our corpses when we die. We think we’re tending the orchard field but it’s really the orchard field tending to us!”
“Where the hell did you hear that?”
“From some pacified herd in the south. They’re mostly dead now. Dog worshippers the were. Fed their dead to packs of dogs to keep them out of the ground. Ground the bones to dust then tossed in with the water the dogs lapped up. Then they made bricks out of the feces.”
“No wonder you’re all …” Loopey
“You’ve always said I should contemplate more, so I’ve been contemplating. What do you think Eliza?”
“Living things can grow. Everything else can only waste away.”



You’ve won not when you can stab your opponent in the belly, you’ve won if you can bring your blade to a narrower angle than the opponent. Because that means you’ve got a quicker path to the belly. 
So, let’s just stand here , sword to sword. 
Pytele copies the pose
So here, we’re even. Now if I pull my sword to swing, you’re winning. One step and stab and I’m dead. If I take a step back, and out of your range, it doesn’t matter. This is the first beginner lesson: you start the swing out of range, finish it in range. If you’re going to give the opponent the angle advantage, then stay out of range. Like so
Alright, back to the the start. One way of gaining advantage might be to simply knock the opponents sword, like so:
My sword’s on the line, yours isn’t, so I’ve won. But theres an easy counter, I’m sure you can think of it. Yes, you can simply move the sword out of the way, but you’re moving the sword off the line. You’re giving it up without me hitting it. 
A practiced swordsman will know all the moves, all the tricks and traps. So if you run into one, your best bet is to simply maintain a safe distance. You should run, if the mood calls for it.
How do I know if my opponent is skilled?
Oh, you’ll know in an instant whether or not your opponent knows about the line, about distance. The number of men I’ve killed with their sword out to the side like this, mid swing, its absurd. It’s like they’ve got this thought that if they start their swing first, that means I’ve got to parry it. It doesn’t enter their minds that I could just take a step forward, close the distance myself, and then stab them.

But if enemy know about distance, about the line, you should probably run. Everyone else, the mere fact that you’re considering it means your much more likely to win. And this is the thing about fighting - about everything really - it’s more about knowledge and experience than your god-given physical tools. I’m one of the smallest in the Ayramun, but no one here would fight me.

I would - mazyd says.

You would? You haven’ t got hands.

If I had hands, I would have fought you.

That’s surprising. I thought your lot just zapped people to death. What’d you learn swordplay for?



Strength, agility, these only come into play in bouts of similar skill.



- They’re out in the Sand - passing along gravellands 
- Pyetle decides to help out Mazyd.
- What happened in that cave?
- Mandrameen gets a hold of Pyetle. Inquires into his past life. Inquires into the time he met Ayram. Reveals they were all similarly distressed when Ayram picked them up.
- Pyetle asks about who Ayram is. What’s his deal? I had an experience.
- He’s going to throw the Empire out of the continent.
- I mean what’s his real deal? IN the underworld there was, for a moment I thought he was  demon. I saw things.
- A powerful being, but no, but not a demon.
- Asked Seilsi for his story. ???
- Interrupted by scout - Imperials are on the track - still really far away.
- How the hell! (It’s Mazyd) - we’ve been careful, we’re off the road.
- Double pace to Minting Rock
- “Ah, there it is” - outcrop of rock. Band’s secret minting facility.
- Signs that someone’s been here.
- Hill checks it out. Laughing. Says come on in.
-They stumble on a dried out corpse of a man. It’s an old friar. Must have gotten lost on the Charnel Road or something.
- Relsa, “He’s alive!” “What did he say?” Begone temptress.
- they revive him. See he’s a priest of the dreamer. Pella explains. I was once a priestess. Didn’t know this dude though.
- Hill shows pyetle gold store. Good amount of gold. “Not much of it left”. They put it on the horses and take it away, Pyetle knows not where.
- Pick up water from spring nearby.
- Pella scope sees troops. Mazyd confirms that they’re imperial - they’ve just gotten down into the plain.
-COming right for the rock - interrogate Mazyd - tie up, blindfold, wind, etc. 
- need to change course - lose them in the Sandslants

Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
 “The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Urghiz is a long way off.

“Yeah.”
 “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.” 

 

, he came at last upon a rocky mountain with a large cave at the foot of it and a large stone over the entrance. After removing the stone and going in, eager to explore the unknown with a human curiosity, he found a spacious chamber, with an opening to the sky above covered over by spreading branches of an ancient palm tree. There was a sparkling spring there, from which a stream overflowed through a little opening, and soaked away into the earth. There were also a few little buildings near the foot of the mountain containing the knives and anvils and mallets used to strike coins; Egyptian writings tell us that this used to be the site of a secret minting factory at the time when Antony and Cleopatra were together.

Pyetle took Mandrameen’s outstretched hand and the boy helped him up. Pyetle was surprised to feel a sinewy strength in the lad; he was a bit scrawny and had a bookish look about him, with a weak chin and a scholar’s neck. He’d seen the Mandrameen ruffling through some papers earlier. He’d assumed the boy was something of a camp follower, but this close he noticed the boy’s belt was actually a corded Jandrian sling, patterned for war. Mandrameen’s firm grip suggested expertise.

They ordered another young man in the flower of his youth to be taken into a most pleasant little garden, with white lilies and red roses, and a gentle murmuring stream winding through it, and the wind making a sweet whisper though the leaves of the trees, where they made him lie down on a feather bed, and left him there, tied down with soft silken bonds to prevent him escaping. After they had all gone a beautiful prostitute came in, and began stroking his body in the most delicate of embraces, and, shameful to relate, fondling his manhood in her hands, in the hope of so inciting him to lust that she might win a shameless victory over him. I don't know how this soldier of Christ did it, or how he summoned up his resolve. But will pleasure be the victor where torments fail? For at length, inspired by heaven, he bit off his tongue and spat it in her face as she tried to kiss him. And so the immense pain which followed was stronger than the feeling of lust.

            <Text>All about him, like the soughing of surf, he hears the murmurs of men dozing fitfully. 

There has been really no excuse for coming, but he continues to sit on the box because it is cooler here, and the odor of the latrine, the brine, the chlorine, the clammy bland smell of wet metal is less oppressive than the heavy sweating fetor of the troop holds. 

At 0400, a few minutes after the false dawn had lapsed, the naval bombardment of Anopopei began. All the guns of the invasion fleet went off within two seconds of each other, and the night rocked and shuddered like a great log foundering in the surf. The ships snapped and rolled from the discharge, lashing the water furiously. For one instant the night was jagged and immense, demoniac in its convulsion.
Then, after the first salvos, the firing became irregular, and the storm almost subsided into darkness again. The great clanging noises of the guns became isolated once more, sounded like immense freight trains jerking and tugging up a grade. And afterward it was possible to hear the sighing wistful murmur of shells passing overhead. On Anopopei the few scattered campfires were snubbed out.
The first shells landed in the sea, throwing up remote playful spurts of water, but then a string of them snapped along the beach, and Anopopei came to life and glowed like an ember. Here and there little fires started where the jungle met the beach, and occasionally a shell which carried too far would light up a few hundred feet of brush. The line of beach became defined and twinkled like a seaport seen from a great distance late at night.

But Mandrameen was eager for conversation.
“May I ask, Mandrameen, why are you here?”
“Well…” Mandrameen paused to look for a good answer. “I guess you could say I’m a new recruit.” 
Mazyd started to laugh but it stuttered into another coughing fit- this time when the blood and spittle came out it stained Mandrameen’s toes.
“Pardon me. Sorry. I would cover my mouth with my hands but I was recently robbed of them.” He held both his arms into the light to show the truth of it. Both arms ended in bandaged stumps.
“Well... I, uh…”
“Why are you in here with me, if you’re one of them?”
“Like I said, I’m new. I was told that they don’t trust me just yet. Don’t want me slinking around their hideaway I suppose.”
“They don’t trust you?”
“I’ve only just joined.”
“Do you trust them?” 
“No… well... I suppose I do a little… Actually no, I don’t at all. I was just thinking that, you know, I must be trusting them a little to let them whisk me away and throw me in here, but then again, I don’t care what happens to me so much, as long as its not too painful. So it’s not really a matter of trust. I’ve just kind of let them, you know, let them carry me along because the seem to want to do it. I don’t know. Trust is weird thing for me right now.”
Mazyd’s eyes flashed over Mandrameen, who cut nearly as pitiful a figure there in the damp dark. Mandrameen was small, skinny and balding. Every part of him was disheveled. 
“You don’t care if you die?” the boy asked. 
“Not really, no.”
“Why not?”
“Usual story, I suppose. I’m old. I’ve lost too much. And too much loss, too late in life, I’m sure you can see the sense. You know, when the prospects are as bleak mine.”
“As ours.”
“Right. I’m sure you can see. Mix in some betrayal, in my case.”
Mazyd said, “I see.”
Mandrameen said,“What about you? What are you doing in here? Must have done something bad to get so roughed up, no?”
“Evidently.”
“You’re not going to tell me?”
Mazyd’s shoulders slumped. Where he once seemed at relative ease, even curious, his next question came in a hurt whisper “Is that what this is? Feigning kindness to get information? Just get on with the beating”
“Information? No. What? No. Like I said, honestly, I’m new here.”
“No one is ‘new’ to a band of thieves.”
“Thieves?”
“Setting up an ambush on an old smuggling road, yeah, I’d call that you thieves.”
“I don’t know anything about that. Is that why you’re down here? You got taken off the road?”
“You honestly don’t know?”
“No. No I didn’t know they did that kind of thing. I thought they were… I don’t know. Something more like zealots.”
“Zealots of a kind.”
“I’m here because of the most incredible coincidence. So incredible it had to be ordained by Sol himself. ”
“Ordained by Sol?”
“Yes. Why not? Was it a miracle? No. But it was next of kin; a blessing. If I were a holy man it would have been a miracle.”
“I see. Only, blessings and miracles don’t lead you to being locked in a bandit’s prison.”
“They’re not bandits.”
“Oh. Right. It was a gaggle of priests who slaughtered my men, ruined my body, and locked in me here to die.”
“Have you seen Ayram?”
“Who?”
“Ayram. You can’t have missed him.”
“Not sure.”
“He’s a colossus.”
“Is Ayram the leader of these bandits?”
“Boy, they’re not bandits. And yes, they follow Ayram. They’re Ayramun. And if you had seen Ayram then you’d know that this is no ordinary bunch of highway folk. I don’t know about why they ambushed you on the road, but I’m sure there was a deeper purpose than simply lining pockets with gold.”
“What makes you so sure?”
“I’ve already seen things.”
“Oh?”
“I’ve just come from the Underworld.”
“What do you mean.”
“Last night I was in Shagota, the capitaline Hill, and I was about to, well, I was about to be killed and then Ayram rescued me. We made an escape through the ways of the Underworld. I followed Ayram all the way through the Underworld, all the way here. Safely. This Ayram can do. Even shadows and ghosts are afraid of him.”
“You went through the Underworld?”
“Yes. You see? Ayram is… when you see him you’ll know what I mean.”
“Ayram pulled you through the Underworld?”
“Yes.”
“Why?”
“I don’t know. I get the sense that he’s got some use for me.”
“You have no idea what that use is?”
“Nope.”
“You’re not the least bit interested?”
“No. I already said no. I’m just along for the ride.”
“Yeah. Well. Me too I guess.”
“Well it’s good that you feel that way.” Mandrameen said. He was a little stunned that Mazyd could maintain a sense of levity, considering his state. “That’s really good,” he repeated. “Impressive, really. If I were in you I’d be cursing everything. Fate especially. ”
“No, this is my fault,” Mayzd said. “I don’t know how it’s my fault, but it is. I don’t think it defies imagination to say that somewhere along the way I made a few mistakes.” Mazyd said this with a great, and it surprised Mandrameen to see the glint of Mazyd’s white teeth. The bloody pulp of a boy was actually smiling.
“Why’d they take your hands?”
“I can only guess.”
“Guess then.”
“To keep me from using them.”





“Just because you can’t see the chain of consequence that leads to your present misery, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t one.”
“Who was this person?”
“The leader of this robber band. His name is Ayram. You can’t have missed him.”
The young man shook his head and said, “I’ve only heard voices.”
“Well, when you meet him you’ll know who he is.”
Mazyd grunted in a show of indifference and slumped down against the rock. 
“Do you owe this man a debt?” he asked.
Mandrameen sat back and considered Mazyd’s question, as he hadn’t thought of it. Did he owe Aryam a debt? Ayram had saved him from Death, but that in itself didn’t bother him. Sure, it would have been cruel to die at Salavan’s hands, so he supposed he could thank Ayram for that - but a debt? Ayram was going to kill Salavan anyways. The whole thing was just a coincidence.
He didn’t spend too long thinking about it, because even if there was an honor debt to be paid, he no longer cared about honor. That was a game for people with something to lose.
“No, he’s just an interesting person,” Mandrameen finally said. “He’s immense. It’s not just his size, it’s his presence. It’s exciting just to be around him.”
“So you decided to float along in his wake?”
“Something like that.”
“Well…” Mazyd said, straightening his back to sit upright, so that he might treat with Mandrameen more personably ,“It’s nice to meet you, Mandrameen.” He stuck out his arm for a handshake, then looked down at his bloody stump, and laughed. Mandrameen laughed along with him.
“How about an elbow?” Mandrameen asked, and he stuck his out. Mazyd bumped it with his own, and smiled again.
“It seems like neither of us have any friends here,” Mazyd said, “and I’m in a pretty bad way. Mandrameen, I need a friend right now, and you’re it. You don’t have a choice. I don’t care if you’re not interested, do what you want. I’m a little desperate. I just need the glimmer of hope that a friend can give - even if it's a one-way deal.”
“I’m not -”
 “No, no, no,” Mazyd interrupted. “ You just do whatever you want. Just know that from this point on, whatever trust you put in me, I’ll treasure it.”
 Mandrameen shrugged his shoulders.
“You do what you want,” Mazyd repeated. “My life isn’t worth much at the moment. They’ll probably kill me before tomorrow. I just don’t want to die without a friend nearby.” 
Mandrameen wasn’t sure how to handle this doomed man’s wish. If Mandrameen were younger, he would have humored Mazyd out of pity, but time had squeezed the empathy out of him. Plus, he didn’t know why Mazyd was locked up, nor why Ayram had elected to chop off his hands. It could have been simple theft, but it could be something unforgivable - Mazyd could be the kind of person to set his hands on another man’s wife. 
“Why are you in here?” Mandrameen asked.
Mazyd sighed. “I was marching along with my people towards Jeket when your people ambushed us in the Junei hills.”
“What were you doing out there?”
Mandrameen’s question gave Mazyd pause. He began to scrutinize his new friend. “We were about the Emperor’s business,” he said.
“What?”
“That surprises you?”
“Well, yes. I figured you to be a thief.”
“No.”
“So, what, you’re a soldier?”
“More or less.”
 “Why did they cut off your hands?”
“Because I’m a magus.”
“Really?” Mandrameen said, his voice pitching in excitement. “Could you show me a little something?” he asked.
 Mazyd just held up his bandaged arms to remind Mandrameen of his predicament.
“Right,” said Mandrameen, disappointed as much as the absence of proof for Mazyd’s story. “Well Mazyd, you’re either a fantastic thief and liar, or you’ve got the worst lot of any person I’ve ever met - well anyone that’s lived past twenty. How old are you?”
“One hundred and twenty two.”
“What?
“One hundred and -” But before Mayzd could repeat the number, he was interrupted by the echoes of feet slapping on the damp stone outside. Then keys scratched at the lock, and the door creaked open. Torchlight flooded into the cell, giving Mandrameen a clean view of Mazyd. The shock of him was nearly blinding. He wasn’t just covered in blood. His body from his feet up to his neck were covered in intricate arrangement of symbols tattooed in black. It was the unmistakable markings of a Mazydei. 
Mandrameen’s jaw fell open.
“Oi, Sandie! He’s awake!”
“Well, bring him out then.”
One of the two captors stepped into the cell. He was a scruffy looking man with a long nose. 
“Can you stand up?” he asked Mazyd. “I’d help but I don’t want to touch you, mate.”
The woman behind him chuckled. “Oh, help him up Deedee. You twit.”
“I’ll do no such thing.”
Mazyd looked to Mandrameen, but Pytle was still stunned by the sight of him, so he put his feet under his butt and labored up to a standing position by using the wall behind him for support.
“What about you?” Deedee asked. “You’re alright, right? Name’s Mandrameen, right?”
Hearing his name spoken aloud snapped Mandrameen to attention. “Yes, that is my name,” he said. 
“We’re off to a bit of a meeting. You’re invited.”


Mandrameen was ushered out of his little cave cell through the crack. the torch, whose name, Mandri had learned, was Hill.
Mandrameen stood up and stretched his back, all the while gawking at Oro. He’d never dreamed he’d see a Mazydai this close, or in this place of all places. He followed Hill and Moteah out of the cell and into the cave proper. She was holding the only torch, and it’s flickering light illuminated the narrow slip of rock under her feet. The rest of the ground fell into a large blue-green pool of algal water. 
It’s walls were waxy and seemed to be frozen mid-melt. Glistening strands of hard seemed to drip from the ceiling like saliva on the roof of a lizard’s mouth. 
They moved on into a tunnel that led up towards the surface. With each step the rock became dryer, and the going got steeper. Oro struggled along. He walked with his elbows tucked tight against his body, fearing to brush his arms against a stray shadow of a rock. It compromised his balance, and coupled with the recent loss of blood, he was sure to move slowly.
The others accomodated him. Oro cut such a tragic figure that, even though Moteah and Sandie despised him in principle, they couldn’t help but pity him. They weren’t cruel people, but this little march felt cruel.
Here and there they would pass a tunnels that spread off in odd directions, up and down, skewing this way that, leading off into some unknown abyss.

“But you understand that I have to hit you now, right?”
“You’ll do what you want. But there’d be no point. We Seilsi do not feel pain if we don’t want to.”
“So if I were to break your ribs, you wouldn’t be able to feel it?”
“I’d feel it. Though it wouldn’t be painful.”
“Well now I have to punch you.” Bullo, eager to test it out. 
Bullo punches him the side. 
Little effect.
“Seilsi don’t lie,” Mandri said.
“Hold on. I didn’t hear a crack.”
Bullo punches again. Clear, loud crack.
Instead of doubling over in pain. Sharp exhale, seemed to knock the wind out of him, but little else.
Bullo is like, wtf.
“I’m curious to see what you’ll do next, Seargent,” Mazyd said. “Seems the long years of thinking with your fists has cowed you. All you need to do is promise me some small pleasure in exchange for cooperation. Incentivize good behavior. Did the comissars not teach you this when you came up the ranks?”
“Pleasure? I’m not giving you anything.”
“Is there anything you want me to give you?”
“I want you to shut up.”
“Sargent -”
“Don’t fucking call me sargent.”
“Sargent Bullo, bigger things than your peace of mind are stake. I know all the strategies, logistics, and capabilities of the Imperial machine. Don’t you want that information from me? Doesn’t Ayram?”
“You’ll tell me how you plan to find the Jandri?”
“Nothing is off the table.”
“So what, I give you freedom, and you tell Ayram everything he wants to know? Actually that brings something to mind - why aren’t you having this conversation with Ayram? I’m just a foot soldier. I can’t give you anything even if you wanted it.”
“The reason I’m having this conversation with you, not Ayram, is because there is something you can give me.”
“And what is that?”
“Your protection.”
“Is that so?”
“Protection from anything or anyone that tries to kill me out here. For now, that means protection from the rest of the Ayramun. I know you’re not a barbarian, but the lot of them are. In fact I’ve heard how they plan to murder me before we reach Jughgar.”
“Who threatened you?”
“Well, they didn’t know I was listening. I am not human. I can hear better than -”
“It doesn’t matter,” Mandri interjected. “I’m sure they were just… expressing themselves. Ayram has said what he wants to do with you. He won’t allow them to kill you.”
“I don’t think they intend to get your leaders permission,” Mazyd said. “In fact, one of them said, 'I hate the bastard more than I fear Ayram’. That sentiment seemed to steel their nerves together. By all appearances, they intend to go through with it.”
“They said the feared Ayram?”
“They did.”
“I don’t believe you.”
Mazyd description. Huge and grand in the eyes despite the pitiful body. “Sargent, you know that one of the many reasons why we Seilsi do not lie is because it helps us treat with our enemies. We can get somewhere in negotiations if they know we’re telling the truth. I’m not saying you have to trust me. I won’t insult your intelligence. But you can trust what we say as sure as you can trust the sand in the Hollow to blow east.”
Bullo tenses up.
“Well if an Ayramun is plotting against Ayram, then that’s something I would want to know. It’s not Mandri here, is it?”
“Do we have an agreement?”
“If an Ayramun wants to kill you, there’s not much I’m going to be able to do about it.”
“If these were men were like you, Sargent, men of resolve, then I would agree. But these are men of opportunity. Simple countermeasures should suffice.”
“We Ayramun lack many things, but one thing we’ve got buckets of is conviction. Really, that’s all we’ve got.”
“I’m not so sure about that. Irregardless, you are my best option for protecting myself. I can’t exactly ask them for forgiveness for whatever they think I’ve done to them.”
“What they think you’ve done to them? You don’t have any idea?”
“I’m sure I do.”
“You feel no guilt?”
“Virtue without terror is impotent, Sargent. Do you not agree?”
Expected equivication, shifting of blame. 
“Why do you think I’m out here? Sick dicks like you running things in the empire.”
“I don’t expect you to like me, Sargent. I do expect you’ll fill your end of the bargain.”
“I’ll talk to Ayram.”
“Keep our agreement between us. ”
“I keep nothing from Ayram.”
“I would feel better about our relationship if you didn’t - and that’s ultimately your goal here, no? The game within the game. It’s not about getting what you want from me, it’s about developing a working relationship, because only then you’ll get what you want from me.”
“What about Pyetle?”
“I trust Pyetle.”
Bullo gives odd look, but then, like whatever.
“Well Pyetle, go run off and help someone do something.”
Pyetle didn’t need to go and do anything. Mandri led Pyetle up to the front of the column, where Ayram walked. Ayram carring Pella on his back like swaddling babe.
Pyetle followed along behind. 
Sun setting.

            <Title>Discovery of the lizard</Title>
            <Text>The lizard was big one, a belly-dragger, five feet long from snout to vent, and almost as heavy as a young man.  The keeled scales that ran down his back were thick and the spines on his fat tail, the one’s weren’t broken, were as tall as a pinky finger. This dragger was old, older than than dried out karkle bush he hid under. Older than the stones hidden under the sand that once marked this place as a smuggler’s road. Older than the. 
This was his ravine.
No other creatures were allowed.


They discover mandri, has a toggle with his name. They toss it - no longer needing it.

Cloistered within the cramped cave was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, five years younger than Pella, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Ayram, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.

Venom is produced in teh salivary glands in the lower jaw and expressed along grooved teeth as the lizard bites. Intense and immediate pain. Before biting, the lizard will hiss, gape, and back away from its would-be attacker if . Once it bites, it generally holds ona nd chews the venom into the aggressor.  Rarely fatal, but may cause pain, edema, bleeding, nausea, vomiting, and accelerated heart rate.
Studded skin - beaded look of the dorsal scales, small bones within the skin. 
Most sonoran desert lizards use a variety of behaviours in a purely social context. Displays to establish dominance or territory or to aid in courtshop. Head bobs. Open bouthed cape and vertical extension of the body and throat of collared lizards. Four-legged push ups and brightly colored dewlap of tree lizards. Subtle shudders of the body. 
Fat tail serfves as more than a way to escape predation. It stores fat, which can be broken down into water and carbs during lean times. 

Colored throats. Throat folds.

If you break a rock, you’ve got two rocks.


Keeled scales runs down teh center of the back. Rows of brwon spots on the tail, which is as long as the body from snout to vent. 

For what nature’s beaty 

There is an old, old Jandri myth that 

Something about events and change.
Where it starts.
Pairing it down.

If he had lived another hour longer he would smelled the musky odor of sweat and beak oil wafting down from the top of the ravine. He would have heard the soft patter of footsteps on the dusty road. He would have seen the bark-sheathe boots a man stop right in front of his bush, and he would have felt two blue-grey eyes gawking down at him through the spaces in-between the karkle's twigs. 
Two blue-grey eyes, Jandri eyes, belonging to a man named Seb Soreel. They were sparkling, bright and curious, and they narrowed as they searched Mandri’s bundled body for any sign of life. Seb thought it would be strange to find someone here on the side of the road, but he knew it would be a bad, bad omen if that someone was dead.
“Oi, Gugi! There's a body under this bush!”
There was a rustle of stones as Seb’s twin brother, Gugi, clambered down the side of the ravine to see why Seb was bothering him. Gugi and Seb weren’t identical twins, but being completely swaddled in brown wool as they were it would be impossible to tell them apart. They were both tall, lanky, and they moved and stood with the same kind of twitchy restlessness that marks out a young Jandri man who likes to chew the spines of borcandi leaves.
Gugi was stumbling his way down to the road because he thought he’d heard Seb say that he’d found a body. When he hopped on over to where Seb was standing, he pulled his scarf down under his proud chin to ask for clarification.  He rarely stopped chewing. His words were a little lost in between the squelches.
“I didn’t quite get that.”
Seb pulled his own scarf down in kind. His face was a little thinner than Gugi’s, and his nose was longer and crooked, and his cheeks were ravaged with pits from . He chewed his borcandi spine a bit more gingerly because most of his teeth thin were thick with rot. Anyone who meets the twins, especially if they meet them at the same time, the first thought is always to wonder why the gods had reserved all the handsomeness for Gugi. The second thought is to wonder if poor Seb had been cursed, or if it was just bad luck - poor Seb thought he was cursed with bad luck.
Seb looked for curses in all things. Pots, pans, dishes. Curses on the road - a rock or a feather sticking up in the sand. A dead body in a bush that he was supposed to be hiding in, now that was as clear 
“Look there,” Seb said to Gugi.
“Where?”
“Feet here,” Seb said. “And you can see an arm, and there, a grayish cloak of somewhat.”
Gugi squatted down next to the bush and tried to peer under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“A body, eh? Guess he’s dead?”
“He’s not napping.”
“Well… pull him out then.”
“Pull him out?”
“The mans dead. He won’t mind.”
Seb’s jaw dropped. All his little crooked teeth. Blinked like he couldn’t believe, had to reboot the brain. “There’s a dead body under this bush, and that doesn’t concern you in the least bit? You just want to, what, pull him out and rifle through his clothes?”
“No. I want to pull him out wo we can put him somewhere else.&quot;
“Just put him somewhere else?”
“Isn’t that why you called me down here?”
“I called you down here because there’s a goddamned dead body under my bush… out here, under this bush... That doesn’t get your grind going? The man’s still bleeding!”
Gugi took a little rock and pushed on mandri’s foot, squeezed a drop of blood through the blood caked blisters. his dark brows raised a little as he realized that this wasn’t just a dead body, it was a freshly dead body. Still, he wasn’t about to encourage Seb’s hysteria, so the most assent he was willing to do was to shrug and say,“Alright. This is unusual.”
“Unusual?!” Seb spun around to face Gugi and was about to burst. “It’s a goddamned curse! Clear as day!”
“Come on Seb, don’t start.”
“Start what? There’s a goddamned dead body in my hiding spot!”
“Calm down! Holy hell. It’s just a dead body. It doesn’t mean anything.”
Seb was about to burst, but then a shrewd thought popped his 
“Did you put this here?” He asked.
“What?” Gugi’s face was streteched beyond belief.
“Did you put this dead body here?”
“What?”
A moment.
“You think I’d kidnap some random bloke back in Solstan, haul his ass all the way out here, then kill him and stuff him up under your bush, just get you all stirred up?”
A smile started to spread on Gugi’s face when he realized that was exactly what Seb was thinking.
That smile was, to Seb, as good an admittance of guilt as any.
A dawnign as the rage started to take Sabe. Gugi came clean before he could blow. 
“Relax! Holy hell. Goddamn. Relax. I didn’t do it.”
“Then who did?” Seb asserted. “This body is fresh as a daisy’s bum. If there was someone skulking around these hills, planting bodies under bushes to put us off, we would have seen him. Had to be one of the Ayramun. And if it was any of them, it’d be you.”
“Ay-ya. Seb. No one is trying to curse you. This poor bik under your bush has nothing to do with us. He’s probably some wayward pilgrim who crawled up under there to eat the dirt and forgot to wake up. It doesn't mean anything. It’s just a dead body. It doesn’t even smell. Just get up in there, and lets get on with it.”'
&quot;I’m not cuddlin' up with no dead body,&quot; Seb said. &quot;And in point of fact, this ain’t no pilgrim road. This ain’t no pilgrim. It’s a dead body out in the middle of nowheres - not the middle of nowheres, its right in the middle of my bush, and that’s the clearest shout of a curse I’ve ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this.&quot;
“He doesn’t need to hear about this.&quot;
&quot;Have you lost your water? Ayram ought to know there's a dead body down here!&quot;
&quot;Don't worry Ayram with this shit. Just get in that bush and stop moaning.&quot;
&quot;How abouts you get in that bush?&quot;
&quot;Okay. I will. I’ll do it if it will stop your shitting.&quot;
&quot;No! You’re not getting in that bush.&quot;
“But you just said -”
“I’m not gonna let you cuddle up under no cursed demon bush right before a fight.”
“Holy hell, Seb. Someone’s getting in this bush. There’s no time to be scrying and softing about what is and isn’t cursed.”
Seb grabbed his brother’s shoulder before he could pull himself up under the karkle bush.
&quot;Look around,&quot; Gugi said. &quot;There aren't any other spots.&quot; He gestured to the sloped walls of the ravine. If a rock was big enough, or a divot in the earth deep enough, a fellow bandit was already settling in. Most were lying down up top, above the ravine's lip. 
Gugi crawls up under. Bunch of rustling as he tries to get comfortable. He can’t. “He’s kinda funny looking”. Has second thoughts.
“Holy shit!”
“What! What is it?!”
“I know who this is.”
“Who?”
“Holy shit.”
“Who is it?!”
Gugi scrambled out from under the bush much faster, much less carefully than how he got in.”
Seb looked at him expectantly, eyes wide and . Gugi was finally looking properlly of haveing seen a dead body.
“Thats fucking Salavan Saran’s kid!”
“Who?”
“Salavan Saran’s kid! What’s his name? Man- something. That’s Salavan’s kid under that bush.”
“Oh shit?”
“Yeah thats him.”
“You sure?”
“Pull him out and see for yourself.”
“I’ve never seen him before. Wouldn’t be able to recognise him.”
“Pull him out anyways. Because you’re right, Ayram needs to know about this.”
“I ain't touchin' no dead body.”
“Dammit. Seb. Grab his foot.”
“You grab his foot!”
“I’m going to!” Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of Mandri’s left ankle. He stared at Seb and shook Mandri’s ankle to show Seb just how tightly he was holding on. Mandri’s foot flopped around like limp fish. Seb took a step backwards.
“Now grab the other foot,&quot; Gugi said.
Seb crossed his arm and shook his head. “Do it yourself.”
“Seb.”
“Gugi.”
“Seb , if you don’t squat down and do a part, I’m gonna start breakin rules.”
Seb scoffed and kicked the dirt. “I ain’t touchin’ no dead body.”
Gugi rubbed his temples. He hated that he had to be the bigger boy. Seb had this way ever since they were kids, this stubbornness, it worked to get him what he wanted, which was always something new and shiny and . Gugi hated resorting to this, to losing Seb’s stupid games, but there wasn’t time to stamp his foot and wrestle it out.
“Okay Seb, what do you want.”
“To get the hell away from that dead body.”
“Help me carry it to Ayram and I’ll give you my shard of salcite.”
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. His jaw went slack and the borkine spine nearly slipped out of his mouth.
“The pointy shard?” He asked.
Gugi nodded. “The pointy one.”
A moment,
“How about it?”
“I can’t take your salcite,” Seb said. “That kind of stone can’t be parted with.”
“Hell.”
“It’s the lucky stone. If you got rid of it, passed it on without the best of reasons, you’d be cursin’ yourself as bad as as this dead body is cursin’ me. That stone is alive. Elemental. It found you, you didn’t find it.”
“It’s a goddamned stone.”
“There’s no such thing as a ‘goddamned’ stone. If you ever listened to Ayram, you’d know that.”
Gugi pulled the stone in question out of his pocket. Describe it. 
He held it up between his finger and his thumb, so that Seb could get a good look at it.
“Help me carry the body,” Gugi said, “or I’ll crush this thing into a million pieces, and then I’ll scatter the crumblings around you as you sleep.”
“You wouldn’t.”
“I’ll mumble the witch’s anguish as I do it.”
“You don’t know the words to the witch’s anguish.”
“I didn’t say I’d chant it, I said I’d mumble it, and as long as I get the cadence right, thats good enough to get the demons stirring.”
“You’re not gonna do that.”
“I will if you don’t help me.”
Seb’s brow returned to its near-permanent scowl. His mind raced for some way to get out of this situation. Gugi was a stubborn ass, and even though Seb knew that Gugi didn’t put stock in curses and luck and mystery, he knew that Gugi would do it if it meant annoying him. 
But if Gugi couldn’t be moved, maybe someone else could. 
He turned round to face the other side of ravine, and called over to the young Papillion, who was busy nestling into the dirt behind a boulder.
“Hey Papi! Come help us move something!”
Papi had been listening the whole while to Seb and Gugi’s little argument. He knew full well there was a body there in the bush. This close to the ambush, people weren’t supposed to be talking, much less shouting, so he showed Seb the back of his finger, and went back to burying himself.
Gugi saw this and said to Seb, “Even Papi won’t put up with your shit. Always trying to get out of things. If I weren’t in charge of this little squad, then I’d leave and make you do it yourself.”
“I’m not trying to get out of anything. It’s just good sense to make someone else do it. The body isn’t cursing Papi, it’s cursing me!”
“That’s trying to get out of it. Now, we both carry him.”
“It's a limp body. It's easier if just one person carries him.”
“And how you figure that?”
“It’s a limp body.”
“Seb, if you don’t grab that leg… 
Change tact.
“I don’t want you to get in trouble. See, I’m gonna hike all the way back to Ayram, alone, and he’s gonna ask me what I’m doin there tellin him about a dead body instead of showin it to him. And I don’t want to blame you for not helping, but that’s the truth. And then he’s gonna make an example out of you.”
“Ayram will understand.”
“If thats what you think, then fine.”
Nothing to do but march off to Ayram. The quick, easy step of a man unburdond by guilt. Soft, head up.
“Wait! Wait.”
Gugi stopped.
“I’ll help.”
Huffing , making a scene out of touching it. Grumbling and complaining all the way back to the plateau.
 Rope, gugi climbs up first, little moment where Seb is staring at the body, then body gets hauled up, and seb climbs up after.

Shelf of rock, titlted, like the corner of a broken table of the gods half-sunk into the sand.


Ayram grabbed Mandri’s right arm and threw him up and over his shoulder, like he was taking off with poached game. He then clambered up the scree, both hands free, easily balancing Mandri’s light weight. In fact, Mandri felt so light that he thought this giant of a man could have thrown him up to the cliff’s edge with one arm. That would have been as comfortable.
When they came to the cliff face Ayram let out a shrill whistle, and a rope came tumbling down from above. Ayram twirled this scratchy rope around Mandri’s waist, deftly knotted it with his long, deft fingers, then tugged it tight, and then Mandri was off.
Mandri bounced along as the rope pulled him up the cliff face. Along the way caught sight of people down in the ravine. The sight of their little heads popping out from behind rocks and boulders, or the lip of the ravine on either side of the road, was shocking. They’d been there the whole time, and he’d walked right through the middle of them.

            <Title>Battle At Minting Rock</Title>
            <Text>
It became difficult for Mandri to maintain a sense of where he was within the rock. He was shoved through so many dark and twisting passages that all he knew for sure was that he was moving away from the center. He got to thinking, after being dragged up a chubby set of stairs and bumping his head on an absurdly low-ceiling, that perhaps these Ayramun had carved out too much of the rock.
From the outside, Minting Rock already looked unstable, like a macca nut resting precariously on a thimble. From the inside, that feeling of being precariously balanced was magnified, as the Ayramun had carved out most of the rock’s meat, and Mandri knew they couldn’t have possibly carved it out in a balanced way. These weren’t royal architects with a trained sensitivity to the straining forces of tension and compression, these were desert folk, and like snot-nosed moles they carved out holes and tunnels and rooms according to whim. Mandri’s toes and fingers would often stumble upon stress cracks in the floors and walls, and in the dusty dark he was surprised to bump shoulders with an unworked wooden beam that arched up and over to keep the floor above from caving in. The fact that it was all still standing seemed a miracle.
The higher up he went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became - the floors rougher, the walls tighter, the ceiling more uneven. Eventually he was pushed into a long and narrow room that was almost exactly as tall and as wide as he was.
The room’s only access to daylight was a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn’t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. Mandri recognized the pattern they made immediately, when the dots were connected they formed an ancient stitch that defined the Old Jandri aesthetic: a circle of diamonds radiating out from a central sun rose. It was the traditional symbol of Solraheen, before the Hrkans got control of Him.
Alabastron incense bottles sat on the floor near the entrance, and thin tendrils of smoke swirled up out of them. The smell of this smoke was horrible. Mandri felt like he was wading through the stench of a mound of peaches that had been left to putrefy in a muggy spring sun. It was a stench so sickly sweet that, as he was pushed further into the room by Sob’s elbow, he had to breathe through his mouth to keep from gagging.
He thought, at first, that the smell was intended to trigger in him a spiritual impulse. He thought that this was some kind of prayer room and he knew that’s what prayer room incense was supposed to do. He didn’t entertain the thought that this cloying scent was meant to mask a more rancid smell until he reached out to steady himself against the wall, and instead of slapping against rock, his fingers rubbed up against something that felt curiously like skin. 
A shock of fright shot through his arm, and he recoiled his hand as quick as lightning. His eyes darted to the wall where his hand had been, but his vision hadn’t yet adjusted to the dimness. The only thing he could see for certain was a dark recess cut into the rock. He reached out again, but Sob slapped his hand away.
“Keep your hands to yourself,” Sob commanded.
“What’s in there?” Mandri asked
Sob didn’t answer. He was busy dragging Mazyd Obo into the room by the wrists. Mazyd Obo, however, had resigned himself to his , and so was free to answer Mandri’s question. 
“It’s a dead body.”
Mandri sniffed the air again, and now that his nose knew what to look for, it ferreted out the tang of rotting flesh being smothered by all that incense smoke. This wasn’t a prayer room, it was a burial chamber.
Mandri turned to protest his new accommodation, but before he could get out a word, Sob shoved him towards the far wall.
“Sit down and be quiet,” Sob said. His stern tone cowed Mandri into compliance. 
Mandri sat down, set his back against the cold rock wall, and was about to settle in for another boring spell of captivity, when all of a sudden, Sob tossed the legless Mazyd through the dark like the once great statesman was heap of dirty laundry. 
Obo crashed into Mandri’s chest, and the two fumbled around in the dark, trying to set themselves straight within the cramped confines of the sepulcher.
Sob tried to temper the commotion with a furious whisper. “This is a sacred place,” he said. “Quit your rumbling. Don’t touch anything. In fact, don’t move at all.”
Then Purl’s voice came from the tunnel behind.
“I need a light.”
Mandri heard the click of an iron striker against flint, and a moment later, a flame sputtered to life above his head. Suspended from the ceiling was a clay oil lamp, and as Sob moved away, its light splayed out on the room’s interior, bringing the haunting sepulcher to life.
Cut into the rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in a peaceful repose, was a corpse. Each was in a different stage of decomposition, and each was as naked as come from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were women.
The corpse he could see clearest was as dry and shriveled as a grape fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been laying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand can last for an age. Cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind, Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. These women could be as ancient as language.
But ancient corpses don’t smell, at least Mandrameen didn’t think they did, so he thought that one of those graves had to be recently inhumed.
He eyed each grave to try and find out which one it was. None of what he could see seemed particularly fresh; a dessicated hand with purple fingers, a plaited braid of cloud-white hair, mostly he saw dry, skin-wrapped bones. No hint of bloat. No trace of the tar-like iridescence of fresh rot.
Mandri began to wonder if there really was a smell at all, and that perhaps he was just imagining it. Then he thought that perhaps ancient corpses did indeed have a smell. He’d never actually seen one up close like this. He’d always assumed that the white-robed corpses of saints suspended from the ceilings of Solitant temples didn’t stink. Of course, those temples burn incense at all hours, so that whole spiel he’d heard about the smell triggering the source of all wonder could have just been a ruse to distract from the fact that the houses of Solraheen literally had rot and decay nailed to the rafters.
Then Mandri looked down and saw the spreading rot in his leg and he laughed, realizing that the smell was probably coming from him.
“Sob, move out of the way,” said Purl.
Sob grunted, then backed out of the room, and in scampered Purl. She was hunched over, clutching a bundle of goods close to her chest with her good left arm. When she got to Mandri, she knelt, then she pawed some her things onto the floor with the wristless stump of her right arm. First to drop was a clean strip of wool folded tight, then a bundle of damp leaves knotted at the stems, and finally a stone mortar hit the floor with a crack. The only things left nestled in her arm were three spool-shaped bowls that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one yellow, one red, and one white. Purl hesitated with these, clearly not used to having only one hand, so Mandri reached out to help. He grabbed the bowls one by one, and set them down between them. Then Purl had him stretch out his leg and she rolled his wound into the light. She eyed the festering flesh with keen interest.
“Would ya look at that,” she muttered.
Sob had been standing behind her, and he hovered over her shoulder to get a look in himself.
“You’re blocking the light,” Purl snipped.
Sob moved back, then cleared his grizzled throat and said, “Don’t do anything yet.”
“Why not?” Purl asked. “This wound needs curing.”
“I want to question him first.”
“You two can talk while I’m working.”
Purl pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her ragged robes, then she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the three waxes into her mortar.
“I said stop,” Sob pecked. “Only treat him if he talks, and that’s provided he is convincing with the truth.”
Purl’s brow knit tight in dismay. She looked up at Sob as if to grasp the truth in his face, and asked “You want to torture him for information?”
“It is not torture,” Sob said defensively.
“Look at his leg! He’s marked for death, and you want to withhold treatment?”
“It is not torture.” Sob repeated.
“It might not be torture,” Purl said, “but it’s something like it. It’s extortion, or, I don’t know, it’s not right, that’s what it is.”
“It’s not torture or extortion, Purl, it’s encouragement.” Sob then looked to Mandri to make sure that Mandri was getting the measure of his words. “Tell me what you were doing in the Junei hills, and Purl will heal your wound.”
Purl clicked her teeth and said, “You sound like this sparkless Mazyd. I, for one, don’t need anyone to tell me anything to do something decent.” And with that, Purl plucked some of the leaves into the mortar, spit into it, then got to smashing that waxy substance into a paste.
“Don’t bring me into this,” Mazyd Obo said.	Purl stopped her grinding. Sob raised his brow in surprise. Mandri turned to look at his wretch of a friend, who was smushed up in between his shoulder and the wall, looking upset. 
“There’s no need to insult me,” Obo said to Purl. “This man’s cruelty is his own, I have nothing to do with it.”
“You have everything to do with it,” Purl said flatly. She then continued on to smash the the leaves down into the wax, the rhythmic knead of her pestle pulping the mixture into a syrupy goo.
Obo said, “I’m quite certain the only thing I’ve done to you Ayramun is fight in self defense. You can hardly blame me for killing your ilk when they were lobbing arrows at my throat. What would you do if some idiot is willing to blow himself up at your horses’ feet?”
Sob unsheathed a sword which was hidden underneath his robe. The sudden appearance of long, curved blade startled Mandri, but Obo was unconcerned, even though the blade’s edge threatened to split his skull in two.
“That ‘idiot’ was my brother,” Sob said.
Obo smiled and said, “I thought he might be. He looked like a pack lizard, and here you are… the resemblance is uncanny.”
Sob’s eyes lit aflame and he squeezed his sword’s hilt tight. “I wonder,” he said, “if I cut off your tongue, would the shit still come spewing out?”
“Oh, let him talk,” Purl said. “It’s good that he’s getting our blood up for what’s coming.”
“What’s coming is your deaths,” Obo said. “In fact, the only way anyone in this accursed rock survives is if you treat with me.”
Purl scraped the goo out from her mortar with her fingers, and then plopped it onto the clean strip of wool. She said, “The only way we’d ever treat with you, Mazyd, is if you showed the slightest scrap of humanity now and then.”
 “You want to me to slaughter seventy men, just to save your skin. Is that the ‘humanity’ you’re referring to? And oh, I might add, you people have disfigured me beyond recognition and you, Purl, mean to rob me of my will. Is that ‘humanity’? Am I the emblem of cruelty?”
Without missing a beat, and with all the certainty of a child praying to Sol, Purl said, “Yes, you are.”
Obo laughed, but Purl brushed away his disbelief with a snort, then said “Don’t pretend like those soldiers marching this way aren’t bloodthirsty, raping, brutes.”
“From where I sit, you Ayramun are much the same.”
“We’re nothing like them.”
“Ah, forgive me, then. You are kind, caring folk who didn’t just chop off my legs. It must be that I have misplaced them. Sob, if you could go and take a look outside, they should be laying around somewhere out there.”
Sob lowered the tip of his sword towards Obo’s cheek and said, “What Ayram did to you is a mere scratch compared to what you deserve.”
Purl nodded in agreement. “You Mazydai have killed more innocents than drought and disease.”
“Have we? Tell me, how many lives do you think we Mazydai have saved from drought and disease?”
Purl shook her head as she slapped the gooey poultice onto Mandri’s wound. “You won’t pull me into the mud,” she said. “I know what you are.”
“No you don’t. Outside of trying to bend me to your will, you’ve never once spoken to me, not until now. In fact, not a single one of you Ayramun had ever spoken to a Mazyd before last week. The truth is that I have more virtues than you can even count. Certainly more than Sob can count. Can you count, Sob? Count to ten for me.”
Sob’s rage was close to boiling over. “Where I’m from you’d be killed twice over already.”
“Where I come from, someone who employs violence to deal with uncomfortable truths is called a brute.”
“Oh, shut up,” said Purl.
“And you, my dear, are a brute as well. A fine figured brute, but a brute nonetheless.”
Sob flicked his wrist and sliced Obo’s cheek. It was surface wound, but it was enough to send a trickle of blood streaming down Obo’s jaw.
“Bloodthirsty brutes,” Obo said. “And what was that last indictment of yours, Purl? Raping? You could rape me, Sob, but I don’t think you’ll find my lower half in any condition to ravage. It’s a good thing you’ve kept my tongue intact because you’ll have to settle for -”
Sob made to cut Obo’s words short with his blade, but Purl leapt up and pinned Sob’s wrist to the wall. “He doesn’t have a Spark,” she said. “He’s not worth it. Save it for the Hrkans.”
Sob grunted, sheathed his sword, then stormed out of the narrow chamber.
Sob’s wake left a void of purpose in the air, and Mandrameen seized the moment by inserting himself into the conversation with all the bluster and arrogance of a churchmouse.
“If I could get in a word on my own behalf,” he squeaked.
Purl turned her attention towards him. The fact that no one stopped him let Mandri know he should continue.
“I’m more than willing to answer anything you want to know about me,” Mandri said. “It’s just, I don’t have anything particularly interesting to say. Like, you people think I’m some kind of living curse but I’m not, I’m just a person.”
Purl crossed her arms and asked, “If you have nothing to hide, why didn’t you cooperate with Moto?”
“Because Moto is an asshole, that’s why.”
Purl rolled her eyes. “That’s why? You serious?”
“He threw me into a lizard pit!”
“Moto said you jumped into that pit yourself.”
“He’s godsdamned liar.”
Lock eyes with purl. Stuck in. “You know, he also said you killed yourself, that’s why you were dead out in the Junei plain. Is that true?”
“I didn’t kill myself. I was stabbed in the chest by this crazy guy in Meskalim.”
“If you were killed in Meskalim, then how did your body end up all the way out in the Junei?”
“How could I know that? I was dead.”
“Who was it that killed you?”
“Salavan Saran.”
“Salavan? The governor of Meskalim?”
“The same,” Mandri said. “He is an eccentric one. Three beans short of a full pod, he is. He was raving about some kind of prophecy involving a painter and some god I’d never heard of. I’m a painter, you know, I mostly do portraits, and, well, that doesn’t matter. I guess he thought I might be the one to fulfill this old prophecy.”
Purl didn’t seem to believe him. “This prophecy involved killing you?” she asked.
“I guess.”
Purl paused to consider Mandri’s story. At first, she seemed confused, like there wasn’t a word straight. Then Mandri saw a glint in her eye and her whole countenance shifted to 
“Which god did you say it was?” Purl asked.
“What?”
“Which god was the prophecy about?”
“I don’t remember,” Mandri said. “It’s not a prophecy I’d ever heard of. Salavan said it was the same god as Solraheen’s brother, Ulhuun, but he had a different name for him.”
“Mid?”
“Yeah, that was it.”
Purl’s face went blank and
“Holy shit.”
Look to eachother. Eyebrows raised.
Purl asked, “You said you’re a painter?”
“Yeah. Well, I was, I’m not anymore though. I’m a farmer.”
Before he could finish his sentence, Purl had already swiveled on one foot and rushed out of the room.
Mandri looks to Mazyd Obo.
Obo chuckled and said, “That went poorly for you.”
“What did I say?”
“I take it you haven’t run across many desert dwellers. Their superstitious folk. You’ve just spooked that girl.”
“Clearly.”
Mazyd Obo pulled himself out of Mandri’s corner and stretched himself along the floor, now that there were fewer bodies in the room.
Obo said, “I can hear Purl talking with Sob right now. Want to know what they’re saying?”
“What.”
Obo crooked his ear towards the entrance. Mandri tried to pick Purl’s voice from out amongst the whispering echoes and the sound of pattering feet of that carried right Minting Rock’s many tunnelwork.
Obo didn’t have such trouble.
“Purl mentions something called the Midden Rite… Has to do with Mid, and that prophecy you were talking about. They fear this Mid… That’s putting it lightly… Oooph, Sob wants to cut off your head... While Purl… Purl thinks Ayram should know about you first... Sob’s being stubborn about it… And, aha! This is great. Purl says that if you truly are some prophesied soul, then killing you won’t solve anything because you’ll just find a way to come back. Now that’s the kind of childlike logic you love to hear from the faithful.”
“That’s exactly what Salavan said when he killed me.”
“And you know what, here you are, alive.”
“Here I am.”
“A man killed you, and you came back. Maybe you are a chosen one.” Obo said this in jest, his tinged with the lilt of the unbeliever.
“Maybe I am,” Mandri said.
 “It’s funny, here I was thinking Mid never existed.”
“If Solraheen exists, why wouldn’t his brother?”
“The Mazydai have searched for evidence of Mid’s existence, and we haven’t found a shred. Solraheen is real enough, buried deep under Jeket. I should add that, even if Ulhuun, or Mid, isn’t real, the fear of him is. You should be careful mentioning one of those names around these Ayramun. They’re some secret cult of Solraheen that I’ve never heard of.”
“I think it’s a little late for not mentioning Mid.”
“Yes, but you were truthful, and that counts for something with these people… It’s got Purl convinced that you were an unwitting participant in whatever happened in Meskalim.”
“I was.”
“Ah, now you’ve convinced me too.”
Mandri sighed. He peeked under the poultice on his leg and was surprised to see that the black rot was already receding. He said, “At least Purl seems like a normal human being.”
Obo propped himself up on an elbow and said, “What is a ‘normal human being’, Mandri? I’ve known enough humans to know that there’s no such thing as ‘normal’.”
“I mean reasonable. She seems reasonable.”
“I would argue that there’s no such thing as a reasonable human being either.”
“Of course there is.”
“There isn’t,” said Obo, smiling as he said it.  
“Ok, she seems kind. Ever met a kind human before?”
“Kindness for kindness sake? No. There’s always some expectation of reciprocity or divine reward.”
“I’m sorry you feel that way. There’s kind people out there.”
“Like Purl?”
“She seems to be kind, yeah.”
Obo propped himself up on both elbows and pulled his robe open to reveal the scar running down his sternum. He pointed at it and said, “Purl cut me open. Then she cut off her hand and buried it in my chest. As we speak, her fingers are gripping my heart. She means to make me her slave. Tell me, is this some foreign styling of kindness I’ve not yet encountered?”
“There’s a hand in your chest?”
“Not any old hand. It is Purl’s hand. That’s what a ___ does, they invest their will into your vital through the use of their dominate hand.”
Never back down.
“Well, you’re not human. There’s a hierarchy to things like kindness.”
“Is there?”
“Yeah. Like, it’s not kind to a lizard to hunt it for food, but really, it is kind, because it’s more important to feed that lizard to a starving neighbor. I would say someone who does that is kind.”
“You know what, Mandri. You are right. So long as we define kindness as unselfish concern for your own kind, then yes, I have met kind human beings. In fact, just about every person I’ve ever met is ‘kind’ in that respect, they just have differing definitions as to what ‘kind’ of thing is worth helping. Perhaps I should look into the etymology of the word. ‘Kindness’ does seem to imply a discrimination according to kind. It’s that I was operating under the assumption that we are discussing a truer kindness, a blind altruism, in which case, I can assure you, Purl is not a kind human being.”
“She seems nice. Nice. Can we say that? You know, people aren’t all bloodthirsty, power mad, assholes pining for rape and war and destruction. You’ve spent too much time in the palaces of Jeket.”
“Mandri, consider where we are. We are literally inside of a rock, in the middle of nowhere, and yet...”
Obo paused and 
“And yet, what?”
“Give it a moment.”

Hrkan horn of war, a deep and yawning howl.
BWEEEEeeee-uuuuuhhhhhh
Stirs the hornet’s nest inside of Minting Rock.
Mandrameen stood up and looked through one of the small holes in the wall behind him. It was hard to see much because the rock was thick, limiting the field of view. A Hrkan column.
“Look, just because the Hrkan’s rampaging has brought them all the way out here, that doesn’t mean everyone else is a .”
“It’s the Ayramun that have brought the Hrkans out here, Mandri, and it’s not the Ayramun’s renowned kindness that’s done it.”
“You know, earlier you were saying these Ayramun were good people, and now you’re trashing them?”
“I thought you understood that my expectations for desert folk are so low that ‘goodness’ is euphemism for a baseline degree of decency.”
Looks out the holes.
“This is going to be a bloodbath.”
“It will be a slaughter. There’s seventy Hrkans out there, against twenty Ayramun.”
“Yeah, but, come on. I’ve seen a Hrkan conscript. They’re as skinny as me. And most of these Ayramun are killers. I bet Ayram alone could take twenty or thirty Hrks before getting knicked. And this rock is practically a castle. It’s got murder holes. Its got a well. Everything. What are the Hrkans going to do, lay siege? Out here in the desert?”
“Those aren’t conscripts, Mandri. Even if they were, it wouldn’t matter, because there’s also a Shade among them.”
“So?”
“You’ve never seen a Shade fight, have you?”
“No.”
“Never heard stories?”
“I didn’t know they existed until the other day. And you had no problem blasting his head off his shoulders.”
“I caught him by surprise.”
“He didn’t look tough.”
“Shades, like us Mazydai, are not human. They’re born and bred for one purpose alone: putting down a Mazyd should one ever escape the leash, and as such, they are quite powerful creatures.”
“So, what, he’s got magic?”
“Not like me, no. But to your eyes, a Shade might seem superhuman.”
Obo looks through the hole. Perfect discipline. Mandri doubted there were enough murder holes to make this defense work. Trickle of fear.
“Is he a swordsman?”
“He is, and he’s a far stronger than any human being could hope to be. Ayram may be big, but he’ll got cut down to size quickly enough.”
“And if they get in, that Shade is going to kill you, right?”
“That is his mandate.”
“He’s going to kill me, too.”
“Why wouldn’t he?”
“And you’re just going to lay there and let him do it?”
“I am.”
“I thought we were friends, Obo. If you were a true friend, you wouldn’t sit idly by while I get chopped to pieces.”
“That’s an interesting thing for you to say, because I distinctly recall you claiming that true friendship has nothing to do with supplying favors.”
“Saving a friend’s life isn’t a favor, it’s what friends are for.”
“So we are friends, then?”
“If you blast that Shade to smithereens, I will wash your feet with-”
“My feet?”
“I’ll wash your nubs with the richest blueseed oil that I can find. I’ll make it myself.”
“You are only proving my point, Mandri. ‘Friendship’ is a coercive, transactional system that is entirely contingent on the assumption of reciprocation. As soon as there is the slightest hint of an unpaid debt, then-”
“Obo, stop. Just stop. Help me understand why you won’t open your goddamn mouth, and blast sunfire into those Hrkan faces. I mean, they’re coming to kill you. Do you have no sense of self-preservation?”
“You don’t need to understand, Mandri. We are friends. We should simply encourage each other in this time of crisis, no?”
“Okay, Obo. Okay. You’re right. Let’s encourage each other. What should I say? I love you Obo, and I can’t wait to get slapped in the face with a sword right next to your skewered corpse. I can’t wait to set foot in the come-hereafter. Now, I know you haven’t got a Spark, so you won’t be there, but that’s just, well, that just makes all this so much sweeter, doesn’t it?”
Obo laughed. “It really does.”
“No, it doesn’t.”
Suddenly, a whistle, shrill and piercing, rang out from the Hrkan column. It was not a sound that Mandri had ever heard. It was metallic, tinny and it quivered like a strandtail’s warble. It was ten times louder than any four-fingered shepherd’s whistle. It was sharper than the shriek of hunting hawk. The sound cut through the rock so clearly that it’s source might as well have been in the room. It was a pain between Mandri’s ears, but it was doing something deadlier to Obo.
Obo was collapsed on the floor, and his eyes were rolling around in their sockets, twitching and turning like there was something inside his skull stabbing at his ocular nerve. Then the whistling jumped to a higher pitch, and Obo’s whole body began to convulse. Mandri reached out to keep Obo’s head from thumping against the stone, but before he could do anything, Obo’s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim, blue, formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless. The strange light hovered just above Obo’s lips for the briefest spell, then the whistling shifted its register again, and the ember darted right towards Mandrameen’s head.
Mandri ducked out of the way, and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his flesh as it went. It continued on to punch a hole the size of Mandri’s fist into the rock behind him, and Mandri spun around just in time to watch it zip out into the sky. He lost sight of it for a moment against the deep blue, then found it again as it dove towards the Hrkan line. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, as if swallowed up by something amidst the Hrkan line.
Before Mandri’s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded again.
BWWWAAAAAAAWWWWW-oooooooo.
The deep bellow nearly shook Mandri out of his skin. He’d heard the horn before in Jeketian parades meant to reinforce the power of the Hrkan lords, but this time, this time the horn was meant for him, and on that end there was a terror welling up in his gut.
Through the hole left by Obo’s ember, Mandri could see the Hrkan column clearly. It was flattening out to a square, and as soon as that square was made solid, a command was barked, and the soldiers began their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the rain of missiles that was sure to come.
Twenty paces later, the arrows flew out from Minting Rock. It felt to Mandri like the rock had come alive, like he was inside the stomach of a lumbering ridgeback lizard shooting it’s quills at an onrushing Hrkan snake, and while most of the arrows bounced harmlessly off the Hrkan hide, some snuck in between the scales, wounding the creature, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number and the triumphant whoops and yips of the Ayramun.
Yet these little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the death of one soldier was closed in rhythmic time. Left, right, left, reform. Left, right, left, reform. No stumbling. No gap between the lines. 
Inside of Minting Rock there was a flurry of activity. Ayramun would scuttle from room to room, trying to find a better angled hole to fire upon their target. Some who scampered by Mandri’s burial chamber were ferrying bundles of arrows from one shooting nest to another.
Sob rushed by, then stumbled backwards, noticing the new hole in Mandri’s wall.
“Move out of the way!” he shouted, then ran in, kicking Obo’s lifeless body to the side, and started firing arrows down at the marching men.
A gleam in sob’s eye, total fixation on the task, gleam when the, 

Not being able to see what was going turned Mandri into an anxious wreck. He knew the Hrkans would be at the rock soon, but what they would do, how many the Ayramun would kill, how . Then Mandri heard a noise which

Chink. TINK.

“What was that?” Sob wondered aloud.
“Sounds like a fucking chisel,” Mandri said.

Chink. TINK.

Sob turned around, eyes wide in alarm. Then he shoved Mandri aside and leapt towards the tunnels. Mandri made to follow, but Sob stopped him with a shove on the shoulder.
Mandri began to argue, “If there’s a way out-” but Sob shouted over him.
“Shut up and stay put!”
Mandri scurried back to the hole in the wall and tried his best to make sense of the situation. All he could see was a bevy of upturned shields, in the center of each, the gold-eyed sun, the sigil of Hrk, looking up at him with dumb indifference.
DINK-DINK-DINK
The chiseling was getting louder, faster. Then, echoing up the tunnels behind, the first roars men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in that entrance tunnel, men were about to get hacked to pieces.
Then came a loud crack - the snap of sandstone snapping. 
CRACKKKKkkkk-kkk-kkkkkk-k.
The whole of Minting Rock lurched. Mandri stumbled, felt the rumble of the structure beginning to collapse under his feet. The sound of crunching rock echoed round like the peal of distant thunder.
Then all went silent.
No shouting. No chiseling. No noisome brawl or clashing of swords. Even the sandfleas gnawing on loose grain stopped and swirled their antennae, sensing an ominous in the air.

CHINK.

A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri’s burial chamber. Minting Rock lurched again, and the dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered.
“Obo!” Mandri shouted. “Obo, wake the fuck up!”
With a jolt, the crack in the floor opened wider, then a thunderous boom sent it shooting across the length of the room, fracturing the chamber in two. The whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new foundation of rubble, a, twain.
Mandri, fear pulsing in chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo’s wrist and threw him into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed the Mazyd as far towards the back as he could, stuffing Obo’s tumbling arms under his body, then Mandri crawled in alongside him. The moment Mandri tucked in his legs, the ceiling started to collapse.
The first thing to go was the clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its hook and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the walls shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri’s grave, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri couldn’t see the hail of stone crashing down. What he did see, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.
Before his shock could even register, the opposite half began to fall away. 
Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of Minting Rock grasped their impending doom. Almost directly across from where Mandri stood, a ragged, fear-stricken man straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as the man rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying prayers up to Solraheen as he went.
Mandri closed his eyes.
There was a deafening crash, and the air came alive with the tinny screech of stone sliding against stone.
After a moment of , Mandri opened his eyes again. He peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. He couldn’t see clearly through the swirling rust-colored smoke. Only swatches of color against the ruddy mist.
A swarm of white Hrkan cloaks.
A sprinkling of black Ayramun rags.
A yell rang out and these two rushed each other. Once again, the battle was joined.
Mandri stumbled back from his ledge - there was no clear way to get down. He thought, for a moment, that perhaps it was best to be stuck up in a hole as high as he was. No matter who won, he’d be safe. He sat down, put his back against what was left of the wall, tucked his knees tight against his chest, and tried to cut, when heard the familiar sound.

Chink-TINK.

Chink-TINK.

Mandri could feel the hammer strokes resonate through the rock. He buried his head in between his knees, covered it with his arms, and tried pretend that none of this was happening. While he could effectively shut out the sights and sounds, his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.
At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee below. A loud clap of snapping rock rang out, and Mandri’s perch swayed precariously back the other way. Mandri scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunderous faulting of joints echoed up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up behind it. The whole terrifying thing swayed away yet again, before settling into a precipitous tilt. What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the terror in Mandri get nice and settled, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall. Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.
The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon. Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and feel useless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn’t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble, his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of red dust and a suffocating blur of sand and stone. Before Mandri could fully realize the horror being buried alive, the rock wall underneath him snapped, his room split open, and the half holding him sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. 
Mandri flew like a dart a few yards above the earth. Such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the hot sand.
When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.
He was alive.
He pulled himself free from the sand, spit some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, and was surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn’t in some state of dislocation. There weren’t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the lizard bite on his leg was still smarting, the poultice was still there, knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be. The only thing that really hurt was the left side of his face, which had scraped against the sand. rash on his cheek where his face had scraped against the sand. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing.
He looked over his shoulder, back at the at the settling dust and the crumbling mound of rubble that once was Minting Rock, and he knew that he’d survived in the luckiest way. It was a miracle. A miracle coming after a string of miracles. By rights he should be dead three times over. He’d been stabbed in the chest, he’d been chewed up by a drag-belly, and now he’d survived a fall from near the top of a crumbling stone edifice, yet here he was, alive and breathing.
“Huh,” Mandri grunted.
It was a such curt grunt, yet inside it was a nugget of something profound: Mandri was starting to consider that he was, in fact, the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy.
He looked up at the sun and sky. The Painted Eunuch. The Eunuch Painter. The Failed Painter. Perhaps that was him. He was being preserved for a purpose. He was invincible. That thought put a smile on his face.
He muttered aloud, “Whatever you think you are, Mandri, you’re not.”
And that was the closest he’d ever gotten to praising Solraheen.
Unfortunately, this quiet reverie was disturbed by the rude shout of a Hrkan soldier coming from behind.
“Die, you rangy lizard!”
Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white cloak running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier’s face, Mandri wasn’t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth? If he was the Failed Painter, living through this would add to the proof.
He held up his hands and shouted, “I surrender!”
The soldier slowed to a march and stomped the rest of the way towards Mandri’s pitiful .
The man snarled when he saw that Mandri truly had no intention of fighting.
“Coward,” he said, then he flicked his sword and said, “Get up.”
Mandri stood up.
The soldier said, “Walk.”
“Walk where?” Mandri asked.
The man pointed off behind Mandri’s shoulder. At first Mandri thought he was pointing at the rubble of Minting Rock, then he noticed, some fifty yards to the right of it, a detachment of Hrkan soldiers. They were standing shoulder to shoulder, twenty-something in all, a fine shout of discipline.
Mandri’s captor prodded the small of Mandri’s back with the tip of his blade, and Mandri began to walk. As they looped around the rubble, the rubble came alive with unmistakable sounds of battle: breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated here and there by a cry of agony.
The first actual figure Mandri saw was Moto. The Zosan was crouching atop a tall, slanted chunk of floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with the other he deftly waved off three Hrkan spears with his sword.
Purl came scrambling out from a hole in the rubble nearby, and she stabbed one of the Hrkan bellies with her knife before sprinting into the sandy smoke. Two Hrkan cloaks sprinted after her, but both came suddenly to sudden, fluttering stop after something slammed into their chests. The sound of their deaths was a bone-crunching WHUMP, and the two men collapsed in the middle of the battlefield, a grand death, grandly framed by the two crumbled halves of Minting Rock.
Standing over them was Ayram.
The giant was so caked in red dust that he didn’t look like a creature of flesh and blood, but sand. The upper part of his robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband, and his long black hair was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled a blackened, cast iron bar that was nearly as tall as himself - it was a spud bar, with a knob at one end, and a flat chisel head on the other. Mandri knew that bar must weigh at least thirty pounds, yet Ayram twirled it as if it were a toothpick.
All that was left of the Hrkan force sent into this battle, all that Mandri could see, were six young soldiers. These men moved to surround Ayram. They kept their shields up, kept their footwork clean, kept their spears steady under their arms - then Ayram swung his spud bar in a swooping arc, and all discipline went to . The iron bar crunched through the shield arm of one Hrk, and then the chisel-head sliced through the face of another. The rest of the hapless soldiers charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram’s speed that he spun his bar around in time to splinter the shafts of their spears. 
Each soldier in turn jumped back to avoid the . One of them picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram’s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt a sharp prodding in his back.
“Get a move on!” The soldier behind him shouted. The man was evidently unconcerned that his comrades had just suffered terribly. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, yanking a distracted Mandri along behind him.
When they got to the Hrkan detachment, the soldier threw Mandri down into the sand, then set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri’s neck to keep his head bowed in obeisance.
The soldier then pounded his chest twice - the standard Hrkan salute - and then he said, in bark of a well-drilled soldier, “My lord Mayzdariga, I’ve found another skulking bandit.”
Mandri dared to look up. Standing before him was a child robed in black.
Obo had said that the Mazydariga were child-like, but this was a literal child, a brown-skinned Jandri boy no more than five years old. So short was he, that Mandri, kneeling, could meet him eye to eye. And Obo had said they were twisted creatures, but this child looked tortured, not twisted. In the place of a nose the child wore a flat metallic device in the shape of a nose, and that was riveted onto a leather band, and that was strapped on round the head. The child’s eyes were so bloodshot that the edges seemed on the cusp of bleeding. Even so they were still filled with a childlike curiosity.
Next this Mazydariga child was a bald, pudgy . Unlike the other Hrkans, this man wore the garb of a venal palace scribe - a pale blue robe with long, baggy sleeves, and a . He had a soft, chubby look about him. 
This scribe looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice, he said, “Another coward lurking in the rubble.”
Then the Mazydariga spoke,  if coming a little sluggish from the throat bothered by phlegm.
“He smells like a Mazydai.” There was no hint of menace in the child’s words, this was merely a statement of fact. 
“Yes,” the scribe said thoughtfully, before turning to address to soldier who’d captured Mandri. “The Lord told you to fetch the Mazyd’s body, not fetch a sniveling rat.”
“Yes sir. Yes, my lord.” 
The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the corpse of Minting Rock.
As the soldier fluttered away, Mandri found the courage to speak, now that his neck was free from a threatening blade. 
“My lord, thank you for rescuing me!”
The Mazyadriga child’s eyes went wide in surprise.
“What?” he asked.
“I was a prisoner of these bandits. I’m not with these people, I was captured.
The child looked up at his scribe. 
“My lord, he is lying to you,” the scribe said to his little master. “This one is a ruffian, just like the rest of them.”
“Is he?”
“He is, my lord. We shall keep him with the other one.”
The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, and the soldier marched over, dragged Mandri to his feet, and led him over to where one of the Ayramun, Seb, was kneeling, hands bound behind his back.
Mandri was about to kneel beside him, when suddenly, a horn sounded and the whole Hrkan line saluted. The Horn sounded again and the marched towards minting rock. 
By the time they got to the whole bloody scene was laid bare. 
Bodies, mostly Hrkan, literred amongst the rubble. Interspersed throughout the rubble were hints of crushed Ayramun; a limp hand sticking from a, shreds of robes and literring the rubble. Everywhere there dried up bodies like the ones in the tomb that Mandri had. 
 The only people alive were Ayramun. There weren’t many of them. They huddled together in the middle of the arena. Moto, Elrahet, Purl, , and of course, Ayram. They watched the untroubled Hrkans stroll into arena. A Hrkan commander gave a shout, and the so
The scribed stepped forth to address the Ayramun.
“The battle is over. Lay down your or arms.”
Actual expectation this would be done.
“Since you have proved yourselves to be ruffians outside the natural laws which governs man, you will be dealt according to the law of beasts, and so you shall be sold in the court of Hababeen, the governor of Eez. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade, and feed your trimmings to the pigs.”
Ayram makes no motion to surrender.
Regent motions for prisoners brought in.
“Toss your weapons on the ground, or you will all be slaughtered, beginning with this skulking coward.”
Nothing.
“No more lives need be lost here today. Toss your weapons. The light of the law demands it.”
“Do what you need do. Or, leave.”
“Leave? That is impossible. You have consorted with a traitorous Mazyd lord. It is our duty, as faithful Hrks in the service of Solraheen, to see proper justice meted out, whether we lay down our lives to do it.”

A few grumbles amongst the hrks, significantly less convinced of the long arm of justice.
Smacks on the back of leg, bows out of the way.
Kid whispers something.
“The lord Mazydriga wishes to know, for what purpose did the traitor MazydObo recruit you into his service?”
Absolute refusal to speak. 
You. What was the Mazyd scheming?	“Uh… That’s not really, uh…”
“
“Obo… The Mazydobo was captured by those bandits. They call themselves Ayramun. The big guy is Ayram.”
“Nonsense. How could a troop of thugs capture the power of a full blooded Mazyd?”
“From what I understand, there was an ambush.”
“Ambushed!? Nonsense.” Flustered. “We shall hold onto you. We have ways getting rats to squeak.”
“You all, however, seem intent on choosing death.”
Could see him weighing up the odds.
“The merciful light of the law affords one opportunity to repent of major sins. In keeping with that tradition, I shall offer you one chance to drop We shall let you go freely, once we’ve branded the sign of the outlaw into your cheek, you will be left alone.”
Ayram ignores. Points at the Hrkan soldiers.
“You all know, that if it comes down to it, I will be the last man standing.”
“Captain!”
“Sir!”
“Cut down that beast.”
The captain put his horn to his lips and blew. 
Form a semicircle blocking the view.

Whistle, shields, 
Ayram steps forward. Big stomp. Glint of blackened iron where the tip of the spear has been worn down.
There is a shudder in the formation. Scream. Metal rod stab explode out the back of the head, circle collapses, screaming, explosion of bodies, , and Ayram comes barreling through. Leads out spear, staps in the back. Ayram whips the spudbar,smashing three skulls in kind, landing embedded in the brain of the man who’d stabbed him. Barrels over them. Breaks through the line. Regent screams and turns to run. 
Decapitates him. Smashes the chisel-head into the back of the neck, then drives the man into the ground, decapitating him. The moment he broke that spine, he broke the morale. With no one to hold them accountable, all

            <Text>‘Believed it provisionally’- seb’s theory about ghosts and faces

The ambush sightspot was a wide midcliff ledge that offered a privileged view of the Scuttle road. It was the last sheer cliff of the Hias, with a tall rock face that went straight down into the clay. It was the perfect spot to keep a watch on the Scuttle Road. To the left you could see it snaking up into the mountains, and below and to the right the road cut through the ravine where the ambush lay, where Gugi had found the body, and then you could see every inch of the road as it wound around some foothills, black screes and outcrops of rock, before coming, at last, to the colorful Junei plain. Once out there the road gets lost in the shifting sands, but since it runs straight west towards the Wadi of Gelf, it’s easy for the mind’s eye to follow.
Gugi was up there next to Seb. He had claimed that he could see the coming caravan in the distance. “Way far out”, he said. There were two other Ayramun up there on the ledge, two of Ayram’s Nearest:  the Zosan Moto and the bloodwitch Elrahet. Ayram himself was somewhere doing whatever Ayram thought was best. Seb thought he ought to know that there was a dead boy on his road, but Elrahet said not to go looking for him. She said, “Ayram will come if he needs to come”, and that was that.
Moto was eyeing the distant caravan through a rock crystal lens which magnified the picture several times over. That lens was a small treasure, a clear little oval. Moto kept rubbing it with an oil cloth to keep it from fogging up.
He looked through it and said, in his usual disinterested manner, “Seems normal.” 
Moto kept one eye closed as he peered through the lens. He was squinting so tight that his  Looked almost so that his upper lip nocked up to reveal his. Brilliant white teeth. Those teeth were such a contrast to his black skin. They flashed whenever he talked. Seb thought that when Moto talked, it was like he was flapping a torch. 
“You sure about that?” Elrahet grumbled.
“Hard to tell. Gonna have to wait a bit. Naught but a few black specks and a cloud of dust. Moving fast though. That is for sure.”
Seb shaded his brow with his hand and tried to find their quarry. He traced a straight line out from where the Scuttle road emptied into the Junei, hoping, with his poor sight, that his eyes would stumble over the caravan as they traced that line towards the horizon. 
“If it’s hard to tell… that’s not a good sign,” Elrahet growled. 
Gugi ease Elrahet’s worry. “They’re still way far out,” he said. “We’ll know in few fingers.”
Seb’s couldn’t find them. His eyes weren’t just bad, they were terrible. If a thing was up close he could keep it sharp, but‘way far out’ and ‘not too far off’ were smashed together into a blurry haze he called ‘out there somewhere’. He looked for them anyways. He always looked because he had come to believe, privately, that he had the somasight - the rare ability to see the glowing aura of color that encapsulates living things. 
Whenever he had the time to stop and stare like this, he’d do it. He thought the great distance, the detached of distance, might make it easier to see a person’s aura. There’s none of the fakery to get in the way. See, he’d never actually seen an aura before. Be he knew he had the somasight. He knew it because Ayram had told him it was so. Ayram didn’t put it so plainly, but Ayram never said anything plainly, and if he ever did then there was sure to be layers of true meaning hidden underneath the surface. No, Ayram had told Seb that all his strengths were weaknesses, and his weaknesses were strengths. From there it was a few rock solid bounds of logic and reason to figure out that blank is blank, blank is blank, and that blindness is a strength because leads a person to somasight.
If anyone else had said that‘strengths are weaknesses, and weaknesses are strengths’, Seb would have disregarded it, because on the surface, it’s just twisting words. That’s the kind of weak thing that tradesmen and slaves and philosophers do to make them feel better about their lot. But you don’t hammer and twist words around until they mean what you want them to mean. Strength isn’t a weakness, strength is strength. Yes, if you change the context around then strength can become a weakness. Put a muscle-bound man in the water and he can’t swim as fast as a leaner one. But that’s a matter of becoming. And besides, that whole strain of thought is just way too simple. Even children know that things are context dependent. There’s no great wisdom in it. Ayram dealt with wisdom. He dealt with the Truth. He’s a man who knows, more than anyone knows anything, that when you are strong people rely on you. He’s not a man to dress up hardship pretend its all roses. The cold hard fact is that when you can’t see, people don’t rely on you. Sure, being blind means you don’t have to stand on watch for hours, and sure, Seb took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, but to call his nearsight a strength because it made him unreliable… well that was just twisting words. When you’re strong you don’t need to twist words. Ayram dealt with things as they were. He was the strongest man who had ever existed - of that, Seb was certain. Ayram’s hands were almost as wide as Seb’s chest and he was taller than any rumor. Seb had seen Ayram wrestle down a caldrian ox by himself. So for a man like Ayram to say a thing like that, to say‘weakness is a strength’, then there had to be an underlying truth. Something practical. Something Specific. Purposeful. Ayram only ever speaks to bend the world to his will. He has the  the cosmic mechanical nature of things to do it. Ayram was setting Seb down a path. Seb was sure of it.
One day Seb realized that the only other person he’d ever known who’d had vision worse than his was Seculla. Seculla wasn’t completely blind but she was as good as completely blind. She could only see splotches of light and shadow. But if she were looking at a living thing, if she stared at it for long enough and got all glassy eyed and inattentive, then she would begin to see bands of radiant color resolving into the outline of the thing. It was an invaluable skill to have, especially out in the Sand. The Ayramun used her to ascertain the true character of those they’d meet; red for killers and the like, green for gentle folk, gold for the merely curious, and so on. 
Using Seculla as an example, Seb figured that maybe normal sight gets traded for somasight. Or maybe somasight is in everyone, but you’ve got to lose your normal sight to get you ready to receive it, because maybe you’ve got to want it badly and no one could want a thing as bad as someone who’s got nothing at all. This had to be what Ayram was getting at. Seb’s own lack of sight would lead to him having somasight. And it wasn’t a coincidence that Ayram had found Seb and Gugi just a few weeks before Seculla had died. The timing of all that was a clue. Seculla was the only Ayramun with somasight, and with her gone there was no one else who could fill that role. Ayram had chosen Seb for this purpose. Ayram was setting him down that path. It all fit. It was only a matter of time and effort. 
Whenever Seb tried to see auras, he’d mimic what he’d seen Seculla do. She would stand as still as a statue and stare without focus at living things. She’d get all shaky and sweaty as if she were killing herself with the effort. Seb wasn’t sure what was going on inside her head. He had to guess. On the outside it seemed like simple concentration, like she was narrowing the world until it was just her and the person and then she’d command them to reveal their true nature.
So there he was, staring at the caravan that was crossing the Junei plain. Staring in its general direction. His let his eyes cross just enough so that the colorful landscape doubled and blurred until the distant gypsum dunes dissolved into each-other. When the edge between the sand and the sky softened into a gradient of yellow-to-blue, that’s when he began to strain, because at that point there was nothing else in the world but him and the distant caravan. Well, the distant caravan wasn’t there, but he knew it was there, and knowing it was there was enough to make the connection. Or so he figured.
For this he bore the look of a man possessed - jaw hanging loose, breath heavy, muscles tight, skin tingling, repeating in his mind the words that should manifest his will: Show yourself. Show yourself. Show yourself. He could feel the energy screaming out of his eyes. He was scouring all the world with it. He trembled as Seculla trembled. Sweat beaded on his brow. 
Then he caught a faint whiff of an odor. A foul odor. Was it him? It could be the dead boy. He took another sniff and then he was sure; it was him. He mumbled a curse. Things like that made it hard to maintain a general lack of focus.
There were other distractions. There were birds chattering up on the cliff behind. Evidently the sight-spot was was little too close to some nesting brightbeaks. Then there was the bitter flavor and texture of the belti spine as it rolled about in his mouth, and Belt juice stimulates saliva, so he kept having to swallow to keep his spit from dribbling down his chin. When you’re that far up inside your own head, nothing breaks your concentration more than having to swallow. It becomes a conscious act. And somehow it’s loud, like thumping on a soggy drum. Then there were, of course, the itches. On the thigh. That was the worst place to get an itch, the thigh. It feels like an ant bite. Maybe it is an ant bite. And once that thought creeps up, you can’t not scratch it.
The worst distraction though, by far, was Elrahet. The bloodwitch was pouring over every pore and of the dead boy, looking for wounds, mumbling her guttural bloodspeech as she did it. Once or twice she gave a curt shriek and then she would hound Gugi about something or other. Seb tried to cuff out the old crone’s ravings but it was no use. Her grating voice could rattle through rock.
Then she wanted Seb’s attention. 
“Seb!”
“What?”
“Seb, you ass!”
“What?”
“Listen to me when I’m talking to you.”
“I am.”
“You smell like a donkey’s teet.”
“I know.”
“Do something about it then.”
“It’s hot.”
“So what it if it’s hot? Splash yourself in musk oil, or whatever you ejits do these days.”
Bloodwitches were cantankerous creatures. Elrahet especially so. You had to let it go because she was old as old can be. Seb had never figured her exact age. Numbered age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. There’s no number for the age of a grain of sand, and Jandrimun like Elrahet were just as elemental. Her features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree. She was shrouded in layers and layers of brown rags. If she went swimming in the ocean she’d blend right in with the seaweed. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable cracked-back lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The dead lizard was two heads taller than the dead boy, counting from its nose to the nock of its tail. It’s scales were red, it’s belly was white, and it was washed and ready for ritual. Two red lacquered bloodbowls were sitting on either side of its belly. Like most bloodwitch tools these bowls had an ill look. They’d been fashioned into scowling creatures. They stood on four short peg legs and the bulk of the bowl was their stomach, which flared out into an oblong, shallow pan. One of them was packed flat to the brim with a red, waxy substance that Elrahet called solrashesh. She said it was the pulped flesh of an ancient king, mixed with lyme and bonepowder. 
These two bowls came with oval lids, and on the top of each lid was a knob, and these knobs were sculpted into the shape of human heads. Flayed human heads. Bug eyed and teeth gnashing. Seb thought that they might, if the right words were uttered, come alive and start nipping at his ankles. It was rumored that they had auras as vibrant as living things, a darkly red aura, almost black, some might say cursed. But they were sacred things. Elrahet proclaimed them righteous things. She used them to wield the Spark of life, to heal, and to pull the magic out of stomachs. Evidently Elrahet had been about to do just that, pull the magic out of the lizard, when Gugi had come and plopped a dead young man right beside it.
The sight of the boy had deeply disturbed Elrahet. She knew immediately, as Gugi knew, that this was Mandrameen, the son of Salavan Saran, and Salavan was Shagota’s Chancellor of Minerals, and Chancellor of Minerals was the man who’d given the Ayramun the tip that a great bounty would soon be rumbling down Scuttle Road.
 Elrahet probed Mandrameen’s naked body for a sign what had gone wrong. She picked through Mandri’s mop of hair like a mother looking for lice. checked his skull for any fractures or . She wiggled his head to make sure his neck was . Once violence was ruled right out, she checked for signs of the occult. She squeezed any birthmark in between her bony fingers as if to rub it off. She traced the outline of any abrasive welts that might reveal will of the earth. She made sure that all the hairline scratches were just bushmarks and not symbols spelling out a curse. All blood witches were driven by inscrutable purpose, and Elrahet especially so, but wha. 
When Elrahet realized Seb was near, and she commanded him to describe exactly how he’d discovered the body. She probed his story with same intensity, asking for clarifications on this and that, but there wasn’t much for Seb to say. He had simply happened upon the boy. When it was clear she couldn’t wring anything out of Seb, Elrahet’s perpetual sneer got a little deeper, a little more. Seb felt whenever she was dealing with him, she was sneering with effort.
If the body disturbed Moto, he did not show it. Not much disturbed Moto. His handsome face rarely deviated from a look of smug disinterest. Seb thought that Moto was too good looking to be an Ayramun, and too fastidious. Or maybe he was just too well-kept. He was the only one to keep his dress clean and clever. He wore a long, burnt-orange tunic over a padded white shirt, and he kept the tunic tight at the waist with a long red-sash. Tied into that red sash was a brown scabbard. Inside that scabbard was long, thin, and elegantly curved sword that had a name. The sword’s hilt was capped in etched silver, it drew the eye, and the rest of the look complemented it; a pair of white trousers tucked into brown leather boots that held an impossible level of shine considering the desert clime. 
There were little silver metal buckles on his boots, his scabbard, and on the left shoulder of his tunic near the neck. Seb believed these buckles to be entirely decorative. The scabbard needed them, perhaps, but Seb had seen Moto slip out of those boots without unfastening them, and then slip right back in just as easy. Maybe the tunic’s buckles were functional too, but they could easily be a bit of threaded string instead. The choice of silver buckles was just that - a choice, something that set him apart. Decoration. All the other Ayramun looked like proper desert bandits. 
If Seb was in charge he wouldn’t have allowed it. It set Moto apart. Ruined the cohesion. Life in the Sand demands cohesion. Moto might be the best swordsman in the world, but that had no bearing on unity.
Even the way he sat annoyed Seb. Moto was there near the edge of the cliff, sitting on a rock with his elbow on one knee, hunched over, eye glued to the rock crystal lens, and he kept his other leg stretched out like he was. It was like he didn’t that Seb could come up right behind him and push him off the cliff. Seb could end him right there. For all Moto’s flair and, Seb could end him here. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. Could do it while Moto slept. While he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.
“You want to take a look?” he asked. Seb was practically breathing down his neck.
“No.”
“You mind shuffling back? You smell.”
“Sorry.”
Elrahet snapped, “I told you to take care of it.”
Seb said, “It’s hot.”
“What does that matter?”
“I get to smelling when I’m in the sun like this.”


She leaned down again to spy the distant caravan through her scope. From this perch high in the strata of a sandstone cliff, she could pick out riders. Her eyes were still sharp. She could even count their number, all the way back to the rear of their column. 
“There’s seventy-two of them,” she said. “And there’s something unnatural as well. I don’t like this.”
“We’ve not had a lick of blood for two weeks.”
“Be quiet. What are you even doing here. Go away.”
Moto said, “What do you mean ‘there’s something unnatural’?”
Moto’s eyes were sharp as any, but without aid of a scope he could only make out the dust cloud the quarry was kicking up - it billowed high into the air. It shone bright as the early morning light picked it out against the darker hues of the fleeing night. 
“There’s an odd fix about them.” Elrahet said.
“An odd fix? You’ve counted seventy-two. That’s exactly how many Salavan said there’d be. This is the right time and place.”
“I don’t exactly trust salavan considering his boy has shown up dead on the road. But even without that, something is off.”
Moto kept silent to give Elrahet time to study the caravan. It would be stupid to ignore the mood of a woman whose misgivings had saved them time and time again.
“It’s the way they ride,” Elrahet concluded. She moved aside to let Moto peer through the scope. “Have you ever seen a caravan guard ride three by three like that?” she asked. 
Moto bent down on one knee and put his eye to the rock crystal lens. The wagons and their guard quickly came into focus.
“I have, but not out here,” he replied. 
Elrahet repeated her stance. “I don’t think we should go for it.”
Moto shrugged her off and took a moment to absorb the details. 
There were eight wagons, several more than the average for a gold train. The tight discipline of the riders made it easy to count their number: three by three as Elrahet had said. Hardly the ragged band of backwash from the Hrkkan conquests that passed for caravan hands in this part of the Sand. Ayram couldn’t make out any insignia or banners that might identify them as professional soldiers. Still, they were quite far out on the Junei plain, and the old rock lens was getting a little foggy. 
Moto compared what he saw to the lay of the ambush that Ayram had set up below. It was the most ideal spot to bushwhack such a heavily guarded merchant caravan. It was one of the few short and straight ravines through which a road actually passed. Its slopes were steep so his people up on the banks would be high enough to have a clean shot at the whole enemy column, provided the whole column could actually fit inside. It would be tight. There weren’t any  trees for cover, but there were plenty of boulders and prickly brown bushes. And those Ayramun that were no good with a bow were skilled at burrowing into the slopes.
Once in the ravine, the caravan could only go forward into the mountains, or back out into the sand. The way into the mountains was easy enough to manage with caltrops buried in the sand, and the road wasn’t wide enough for the wagons to turn around and beat a hasty retreat. Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Moto was not so sure. There was a good deal more of them than there were Ayramun. Three to one. And if they were Hrkkan Zikar’s… well he’d fought them before, and they had a way of wriggling out of your grip.
Moto said, “I’d take them for Hrkkan riders, but they’re wearing that woolen garb.”
Gugi suggested, “It could be that the they’ve been drilling common hands.”
“That could be.”
Elrahet said,“It could be that those really are  Hrkkan troops.”
“But they’re wrapped in white wool,” Moto said.
Seb felt compelled to chime in. “I’m wrapped in wool and I’m half-Hrk.”
“Really? Half-Hrk? When did that happen?”
“You can’t tell?”
“You used to be a Hrk,” Elrahet corrected.
Moto shook his head. “A Hrkkan officer does not drop his company’s colors for convenience. Even in the Sand.”
“The Sand makes converts of us all,” Elrahet said. 
Moto gave a subtle sigh. “The point of their armor, their colors, it isn’t about comfort,” he said. “For them it’s hardly even for protection. It’s about distinction. It’s a certain type of man that seeks out life in the Hrkkan cavalry, and once he gets the colors .” 
Out of everyone there on that cliff, Elrahet seemed the most apprehensive.“Still, they could be fighting men,” she said.
“They could be rabble, they could be Hrkkans,’ Moto said.
“Would it change your call?” Elrahet asked it as if she already knew the answer.
“If they are Hrkkans then they have skin in the game.”
“They won’t run when the killing starts,” Elrahet grumbled.
“And the way we’re set up -”
“This only works if they try to run.”
“It’s only completely safe if they run,” Moto corrected. 
“Then it’s decided,” Elrahet said. “It’s off.”
Moto gave Elrahet is sidelong glance of disbelief. “It’s not for you to call. We are Ayramun. Not Elrahetun.”
Moto took a moment once more to eye the caravan through Elrahet’s scope, trying to find some detail that might still swing his decision. 
The information they’d been given by Salavan was accurate - the caravan was here as predicted. And the Ayramun were eager, rested, and ready. The long shadows of the rising sun would keep them hidden until the most opportune moment. There was even the off chance that the witch’s magic might work. Most importantly, their secret way into and out of the ravine was a hidden crevasse which remained unknown to the Empire, and every day that Ayram delayed he risked its discovery. If found, this stretch of the Junei would be closed to him forever.
“Disciplined riders aren’t enough to call this off,” Moto decided, and handed the glass back to Elrahet. 
“But what of the boy?”
“What of him?”
“It was Salavan that told us there’d be gold train bumbling up this road. Now we find his son dead. Dead in the very spot where we lay our trap. Is that not enough to call this off?”
“Sure. It is strange. But eh. I don’t know.”
“It’s just a dead body,”Gugi said.
Elrahet gives Gugi a whack.
“If Ayram ever makes you Nearest, then you can speak up. Until then, shut it.”
“Perhaps he is right,” Moto said to Elrahet. “You looked the boy over. Found no foul play.”
“I found no sign of murder, yes. No sign of curses, yes. But the fact remains that the boy is dead. Freshly dead. ”
“Perhaps he crawled up in that bush himself. Perhaps he was looking for us. Trying to join up. Run away. You know Salavan doesn’t treat his family right.”
Seb saw the logic of it. The thought seemed right enough. Playing with it happened to trigger another explanation, an explanation that was more in line with the budding sense of paranoia.
He wasn’t one of Ayram’s Nearest, but he felt compelled to speak up. “If the boy was looking for us, maybe he was trying to warn us of something. Maybe Salavan sent him out here to warn us not to attack.”
Gugi’s face took an incredulous turn. “Why would Salavan send his own son to tell us that? And send him on foot? Without a horse? That would be a death sentence.”
Seb shrugged. He knew the idea was crazy, but the uneasy silence that followed showed that it had legs. Everyone’s face that the idea was stirring up fear. Elrahet’s face especially, because her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow would send it cracking into sharp relief.
There was a story written on the dead boy’s face that none of them could read. There simply weren’t enough clues. His skin was raw and peeling. Sun blistered. His lips were ashen and cracked. He bore the calm expression of death, careless and serene, the kind of rested ease that everyone desperately wants but aren’t willing to go that far to get. Set against the stress of the moment that ease was unnerving. For Seb it was annoying. Whatever the boy’s motivations were, he had failed miserably and now the Ayramun were bearing the cost. Let it never be said that once you’re dead you’re done stirring up inconvenience.
Elrahet gave a little huff and said, “There’s only one way to be sure of his purpose.”
That was her final word. It sent a shiver down Seb’s spine, because when a bloodwitch says ‘there’s only one way to be sure,’ that means blood is about to be spilled.
She took the two bloodbowls from beside the lizard and placed them next to the boy. Then she knelt down and pulled a thin needle-wing bone out from under her rags. She stabbed the tip of it down into the bloodbowl which held the sehsli, and in so doing filled the hollow bone with a measure of that blessed flesh. Then she used two fingers to pull the boy’s jaw open, and she leaned close to his mouth, muttered a warding spell, then began to probe his throat with the sharp tip of the wing bone. Once she found the precise spot with which to inject the seslsi, she jabbed down, pierced the decaying tissue, and then blew hard on the back of the bone, so hard that the force of her wind expelled the blessed flesh from out of the bone and into the boy.
 Elrahet sat back on her heels and from her voluminous rags she pulled out a half-moon knife, pulled its sharp edge in-between her fingers, and then asked for a volunteer. She was looking at Gugi and Seb.
“What do you need?” Gugi asked.
“The boy is dead, but his vessel remains intact. It needs a Spark. One of you must give it.”
Elrahet held Seb and then Gugi in her gaze. On each she lingered for a spell, holding them in turn so that she could project a sense of her confidence into them.
When neither of the two men stepped forward, Elrahet stressed the imperative word.
“Must,” she said. “You must give. This is a command. Em bestet buguul.”
Hearing this, both Seb and Gugi knelt where they stood. They touched their foreheads to the earth in supplication.
It was Gugi who spoke first. “Take my Spark and release me from the struggle.”
Seb snuck a sidelong glance at his brother. Gugi’s eyes were closed and he . 
Elhrahet stood and setpped over to Gugi. She knelt in front of him. She set her hand on the back of his head. “I will shepherd your Spark and I cherish willingness with which it was given. Now there’s not much time. Do we not have time, Moto?”
Moto looked again through the lens. “They are coming on quickly,” he said.
“So they are,” Elrahet said. Then she quoted a proverb favored by the Ayramun. “Even the turning of the world conspires against us.” She stroked the back of Gugi’s head. “I am afraid that we cannot stand on ceremony.”
Seb lifted his head and watched as Elrahet peeled a sliver of selshi from the contents of the snarling bloodbowl. She brought the selshi to her mouth, whispered a prayer, then placed the selshi on her tongue and swallowed.
The was the f 
Elrahet closed her eyes, opened her palms to the sky, and sucked air into her chest in short, powerful sips - five of them. She held the wind in her lungs for a moment, then exhaled slowly through pursed lips. She repeated this breathing ritual five times, and at the end of it she had achieved the heightened state of Culrisar, defined as such by the Bloodwitch creed: Nothing but the body and the means to move it. 
Seb wondered how it worked. A long time ago he’d had it explained to him. The I/Me/Mine which defined ‘Elrahet’ was gone, along with all thoughts and urges that obscure the present moment. This was necessary if one were to handle the Spark of the Divine. But it didn’t make sense to Seb. How could a Bloodwitch know what she was doing if she, herself, her desires, her sense of duty and the whole rolling ball of past events was dissolved away? If there is only present, wouldn’t she forget what she was doing? Wouldn’t she be incapable of carrying out a task such as this?
It did not make sense. Yet there she was, gripping the hilt of the half-moon knife with serious intent, and when Seb looked into the her eyes he saw only himself reflected. He did not doubt that the Culrisar was real - there it was. The definitive proof could be seen in the way her fingers, lumpy knuckled and wrecked with uncontrolled trembling, gained calm and strength and precision. It was her right hand which gripped the knife, and swing it around in the air, hand trembling eliminated. In fact her whole posture was , back straight and . She was a different person. Possessed, perhaps. 
Maybe the witch had become a vessel for a ghost. Witches never talked about ghosts, but they talked about fleshy vessels all the time, and vessels are for holding things. Holding the Spark, yes, but what else? If the witch had left her own body, then who, or what, was moving it?  It was a frightening thought, but it seemed to clarify the incongruity of Elrahet’s aged bones contorting about with such dexterity. And her face didn’t move. It did not frown or smile or grunt with the effort. She was like a minstrel’s marionette, limbs dancing as if weightless, face painted on. The thought Seb took from all this was that ghosts couldn’t control faces; if that was how it was, if there was ghost in Elrahet now, then ghosts couldn’t control faces. It was a bit . Made Seb proud. The little self-indulgence didn’t last long, for his focus was drawn to the sight of Elrahet setting the crest of the half-moon blade against the back of Gugi’s neck.
Elrahet spoke in a voice that was not her own. It was a younger woman’s, clear and fresh and brilliant. “Gugi Adeyongee,” she said. “Do not seek, for if your heart is kind you will be found.”
Then Elrahet put her thumb on the flat back of the half-moon blade and pressed down. She pressed the metal down with care and let up as soon the blade cleaved the skin in two. She then angled the blade cross-wise to that first cut and pressed down again. There was hardly any blood, just a two thin red lines, an ‘x’. It was so clean that it was as if she’d imprinted that crimson sigil on the surface of the skin with printing block instead of cutting the flesh open with a knife.
Elrahet took in a deep breath. When she exhaled she sucked in her stomach to push all the air out of lungs. As soon as she was sure that there was not a thimble of air within her, she bent over and put her lips to the wound she’d marked on Gugi’s neck. 
Then she breathed in his spark. 
It was quick, sharp inhale. Gugi gasped. His back spasmed and arched. His arms, his fingers, and his toes curled in towards his body as his muscles fought to keep the Spark’s threads from being yanked out. Though no one could see it, his face was pulled into a grimace of utter astonishment. 
This struggle did not last long. As quick as the tension had come, it left. And so Gugi’s prostrate form went limp and tipped over into the dirt.
A strange coldness washed over Seb. He knew that it was his brother’s heat being extinguished. That warm aura that he only noticed when they were huddled together against the chill of night was gone. Elrahet had taken it, she’d breathed it into her lungs. Gugi’s spark was in her lungs. Seb could see its soft orange flame flickering under her skin. Her whole neck was glowing, glowing so bright that Seb could see slivers of her spine’s shadow in her throat. Her cheeks were awash with light. Her pupils were bright as the sun. 






She turned to face the dead boy, to impart the Spark into him. As she did, Seb noticed that out from under her layers of rags there was a steady steam rising into the air.
In another moment more it was over. She breathed the Spark into the boy’s mouth and then light was gone and she was back to her old self. 
The thing took a toll on the woman, Seb could not see it. Her tremors were worse, her breathing more ragged. He got up and walked over to the other side of the boy to fetch the waterskin that she was reaching for.
“Thank you Seb, thank you...” Elrahet said. “No, not me, its for the boy… Don’t just pour it into his mouth like that. Not like that. Here.”
Elrahet tore a strip of cloth from one of the softer bits of clothing that enveloped her. She bundled it up into a ball and told Seb to soak it with water. This he did. Then he pressed it to the boy’s lips. He was stunned to feel the boy’s breath tickling his fingertips. Seb knew the ritual would work, but it was always a gib to see the dead being brought back to the land of the living.
Seb squeezed the cloth and cold water dribbled down into Mandri’s gullet. Elrahet was crouched low and whispering into the boy’s ear.
“I'm not Death, my boy. You are not dead. Not dead. Not dead. ” 
Mandrameen stirred. The water stung his lips and throat.
He opened his eyes a little. Two dark shapes resolved themselves into people. A man on his left, and a woman on his right - blue sky behind them. Not Death indeed.
“Incredible,” Seb whispered.
“Yes. But if the Calrisar couldn’t didn’t him, then your stink would have done the trick.”
Elrahet stole the wet cloth from Seb’s hand, and in so doing took it away from Mandri's lips. Then she shrugged Seb away with a sharp elbow. “Get gone. Go care of your brother’s body. And care for your own. Thought I told you to take care of that.” 
“How long will Gugi’s body last without a Spark?”
“It depends.”
“That’s why I’m asking.”
“There’s plenty of time to fetch a spark. Begone.”
“My brother is dear to me.”
“Days. Days yet. If you’re worried, go set up close to the road. That way you can be sure to capture one of the riders alive, and we can bring Gugi back as soon as nightfall. Moto will care for your brother. Moto! Moto, take care of him.”
Moto came and led Seb away.
By Seb was climbing down the cliff and down into the ravine, Mandri was coming to. Elrahet opened his mouth with two fingers, just as she’d done before. Her emerald eyes glinted as she peered down Mandri’s throat.
“Your mouth’s not black. The spark taken root. And you’ll get to keep your tongue.”
Mandri tried to respond. All that came out was a wheeze.
Elrahet took her bony fingers out of his mouth and smelled them. 
“Do you want to live?” she asked.
Mandri shook his head.
“You don’t? Wonderful. Here, drink.”
Elrahet put the cloth back to Mandri’s lips, and Mandri drank.
“Don’t want to live, but you drink? Just can’t help yourself, can you? Drink up, then. Drink up.”
Mandri did. The water was glorious. Pure and clear, washing the grit from his throat. For a full finger they kept this up, Elrahet watering the cloth, Mandri drinking from it. All the while Mandri’s senses were returning to him. First was smell - and that was what tipped him that this wasn’t Death, this was a woman kneeling over him. Death wouldn’t have smelled like hard work, like musk concentrate boiled in sweat. This figure, all swaddled in boiled leather and black cloth 
This realization, and the water, helped Mandri find his voice. 
“Do not speak. Do not speak. Not yet. Here, suck on this peel of shelsi. Good. Yes. Just move your head to answer. Nod or shake. Now, is your name Mandrameen?”
The boy nodded.
“Your father is Salavan Saran?”
He nodded again. 
Elrahet scowled. “What exactly is it that you are doing out are you out here?”
Mandri didn’t know how to answer that by only moving his head. He didn’t even know if he could do it with words.

            <Text>The Solitants say that when the world was pulled up from the waters it came out as a solid whole, one earth surrounded by one ocean. When the sun rose it rose for everything at once; birds, beasts, humans, and the twin brother gods: Solraheen and Schisol.
Schisol did not like this arrangement. Humanity was trampling all over his brother’s sacred gardens. Humans needed to be kept apart. Schisol smashed his fists into the ground and split the land in two. In one cataclysmic afternoon Jandri became an island continent. 
How great the trembling must have been when the Hias mountains were torn apart. How incredible it had to be to see an ocean of fish, shark, and whale tumble into green valleys. It is said that for a day all the ocean beasts frolicked in fields of tulips and , and that’s why the waters of the Shalbrumon sea flow so fast today.
But Schisol is the unwitting idiot. He had pushed Jandri out into the ocean, and in so doing, he pushed it closer to the sun. The unremitting heat bore down on the the lush environs, withering them down to dust. In his bid to save the his brother’s garden from the ravages of humanity, Schisol had destroyed it instead.
To add insult to injury, humans made it over to Jandri anyways. 
Meskalim was one of the first places to be settled on the new continent, and yet on the earliest maps it was nothing but a nameless black dot sitting halfway down the Jandri’s eastern rim, if it was dotted at all. Nobody cared for a small flesh market that merchant barges tried to skip on the way to Jeket.
This all changed when a young slave daughter slipped and fell into a hole. 
What that girl was doing in the foothills of the Hias mountains, so far from the city, only Solraheen knows. Some say that she was lured down into that hole by a demon, because the entrance to that abyss was nothing but a black sliver in the grass—impossible to find unless you knew where it was. But that’s all back matter, for what’s important is that when the girl was rescued from the earth she was clutching a nugget of gold.
The shepherd who found her went back to that crack the next day with an oil lamp. Not twelve feet down and his eye caught the glint of a gold stringer slanting sideways through the granite. He followed it through a tight-fitting pocket, and there in that fractured bit of earth he found a vein of gold that was wider than his arms could stretch. 
Mines poured into the hills. This was long before the times of Hrkan science and Mazyd lords, so no real thought was given to managing the uncountable tonnes of rock that were pressing down on the blooming network of tunnels. When the people of Meskalim dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a stiffening mud, but that was it. They didn’t understand that the granite there was fiercely jointed and that a beam supporting one rock might be doing nothing for another just a few inches away. It all looked like one big rock in the dim light of torches. The odd cave-in should have served as a warning. 
One might be tempted to say these ancient peoples didn’t understand the danger because they were blinded by greed, but that wasn’t the whole truth—they simply didn’t have the knowledge to understand. 
Meskalim became a golden city on the maps of a golden age. Its thousand white domes were enameled with sacred geometry. Its boulevards were filled with all the peoples of the world. Its army was twice the size of any other. Its port was the very center of the earth. 
All of this because of gold. 
Gold. 
As bright and as immutable as the divine. Leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in your hands and you’ll be struck with a yearning akin to spiritual rapture—a yearning for more, for as much as you can get.
The folk of Meskalim devoted their lives to it. They followed the gold wherever it went, and it went everywhere, even under the city itself. At the peak of the frenzy a person could go anywhere in between Meskalim’s three hills, dig straight down, and likely as not they’d pop out into a tunnel. 
Then a miner slammed his pick into the wrong hairline crack. The moment his iron smacked the granite wall, a jet of water shot out, and the waters of the Shalbrumon flooded in. When the thinned bedrock fell, the golden city above fell with it. More than five hundred thousand people were swallowed up by the earth, though the number grows larger with each retelling.
Humans are redoubtable creatures when gold is at hand, so it didn’t take long for the city to be rebuilt from scratch further south. Meskalim the second swelled anew, though it would never be as grand as the first, for whenever a nugget of gold was pulled from the earth it was stored in a porthouse before being shipped across the sea or down and around to Jeket. Folks feared the earth might open up at any time to eat their treasures, so common sense demanded that the wealth would be better used elsewhere.
And so, for a thousand years, Meskalim’s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren’t laid out with any sense, much less paved, and these mucky avenues didn’t adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they just plopped it down wherever. And these houses were ugly things, couldn’t be called houses - they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls that were all askew. There wasn’t a true roof beam in all the lower city. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like the place was one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had just happened to blow together.
It was where Mandrameen was born, and he couldn’t stand the sight of it unless he was deep in a burgeon binge.
Unfortunately, he had to pace his beer because he couldn’t afford to be so run through that he couldn’t walk; that witch might pop out of the clouds and smash right through his belly like she’d done to Gil.
He had to feather the effect, take sips from his beer-skin every hundred staggered steps or so to keep himself bouncing off that point of no return. It was a dangerous game, taking off the edge off in chunks, but it was one he was determined to play to avoid thinking about…well…thinking about most things, really.
The rain was helping him with that as well. The constant patter of a wispy rain that always seems to be on the verge of letting up was an opportune distraction. And, dare he say it, Meskalim looked somehow pretty in the white light of a sun softened by a carpet of raining cloud.
Surely, though, this beauty was the work of the burgeons. Mandri had seen his reflection in a puddle, and his pupils were blown so wide open that the smallest ounce of light could get in there, bounce around, and blind him. Every surface sparkled. The falling rain dazzled. Cool muck welled up between his toes as he splashed along Meskalim’s streets and this, too, was flecked with radiant light.
The more Mandri drank, the more he became convinced that this was more than burgeons playing with light and wetness. It seemed as if the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get specks of light themselves glommed up in between his fingertips and lick them. He stopped and stared at one spot the more he became convinced that the burgeonsight was revealing to him the true nature of things, that a kind of oily celestial film coated all matter, and we could night see it because we did not have the sight.
He lingered in the middle of an empty crossroad, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Meskalim. Each roof was topped off with little nipple chimneys protruding from their roofs. Mandrameen stood there, motionless, back hunched, hair drenched, brown tunic slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of his own hand.
His own skin was sparkling. The hollow of his palm was a pool of that celestial substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too. It wasn’t wetness. If it were specular wetness the sparkles would have rolled over the skin as his hand rolled in the light. They stayed put, as if glued.
He licked his index finger. 
Immediately his mouth was flooded with a flavor he’d never known. It was as if he’d bit down on a bloated melon and the burst all over his tongue, only it didn’t taste like any melon at all. It didn’t taste like anything he’d ever tasted. It should only be described by comparing it to abstract things. It tasted like the smell of a field of wildflowers. It was honey mixed with the the vigor of youth.
He squealed with delight. 
He bent down and scraped up a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again, his mouth was flooded with that flavor. 
He rushed over to one and underneath were some clay pots, dry ones. He knelt down and liked the handles, the rim, the body. Again he tasted that divine flavor. There was a little grey pup shivering under that awning, and Mandri picked the little beast up by it’s scruff and licked it.
He squealed with delight.
The pup yipped in fright.
A disgusted voice shot out of the rain, saying, “Get lost you freak!”
Mandrameen dropped the pup and spun around, feet sliding in the mud. He raised his hands to defend himself, but there was no one there. Nothing but glistening mounds of mud, soggy doors, and the sound of rain plunking off broken clay pots that lay strewn in every nook and cranny.
Mandri couldn’t see the Meskalimi eyes peeping out at him, but he could damn well feel them. They were judging him. Did he not look insane? Here he was, a too-skinny young man standing in the muck, hackles raised, having just licked the hide of a poor little pup like a maniac.
“You do not see what I see!” Mandri shouted.
“Get lost!”
 Mandri shuddered and turned from side to side. He still couldn’t place the sound. There could be more than one voice coming for his throat
“I see Sol’s light!”
“GET LOST!”
That shout came from just behind Mandri’s ear. 
He yelped and took off running.
He ran and ran, following the road wherever it was going. He stopped when he realized that he was liable to slip and crack his skull. He hands on his knees, to catch his breath, then realized he’d dropped his beer-skin.
He thought about going back and trying to find it, but that wasn’t possible. He didn’t know where he was. 
There is one way to orient oneself inside Meskalim: memorize all the faces of Meskalim’s central hill. The hill towered over the rumps and clumps mud that was the city proper. The hill itself was studded with proper white buildings, each, each clinging to the hill like barnacles to a washed up corpse. These were the various offices of Hrkan government and the mansions of the people who staffed them. It just so happened that when Mandri looked up at Meskalim’s hill, he was looking at the house of Salavan Soreen. It claimed a privileged vista at the top of the hill’s southern cliff face. Its balconies leered over the rest of the city below, over Mandri. Reminded Mandrameen what the hell he was doing. 
He set off at a determined trot.
He stole a knife.
Who leaves a short-sheafed knife laying outside in a ?
Someone who wants it stolen, that’s who.
Further along, he stole a blue linen sash.
Who leaves a sash like that out in the rain?
Someone who wants it washed, that’s who…but it could also be someone who wants it stolen. There was no way for Mandri to tell whose it was, and who was he to deny one potentiality of desire for the sake of another?
Once he’d gotten the sash knotted up around his waist, he found that if he bent forward a bit, then the bulge of the knife’s handle would get lost amongst the folds. So he walked that, stooping a little, all the way up Meskalim’s hill. It was hard trudging. His legs were completely out of wire when he came upon Salavan’s house.
Or rather, he came upon Salavan’s wall. The damned thing was in his way. If he was going to kill Meskalim’s governor, he need it to move.
What he didn’t need was another reason to hate walls. Walls had gone too far beyond their original purpose. The first walls were knee-high stacks of stones set out in pastures to mark boundaries between goat herds—those are pure walls, wholesome walls. Along with the first settled villages there came palisades to defend against barbarian raids. Those could be forgiven. The day the wall moved inside a city, to circumscribe a rich man’s ground, that’s when the wall became perverse. For almost all of Jandri’s history, a people, a tribe, they lived, worked, and shared together—then came the Hrks and the interior wall, setting in stone for the rest of time a division between those that have, and those that haven’t have.
 Salavan’s wall was huge, four-men tall. Most walls that big in a place as wet as Meskalim are streaked with black and yellow grime dripping down to the street, but Salavan’s wall was pristine. Its plaster was as smooth and as white as the day it was slathered on. No doubt Salavan spent more money cleaning that wall than he spent on bread for widows, or bread for orphans, or anything for anyone. That wall was more important than human life, more important than Mandri’s life. That wall’s raw materials could buy at least fifty Mandrameens. It’s maintenance? At least five Mandris a year.
At least this wall was doing a job, keeping him out. Some walls on the lower rungs of Meskalim’s hill couldn’t keep out a flying shit. They’re purely decorative. Imagine that—a decorative wall—it’s not even trying to fend off the poors, its just letting them know they aren’t liked.
Mandri stood there in front of Salavan’s wall like an idiot. The burgeonsight was warping all the little dimples and scratches and faint finger-drags that were imprinted there in the plaster. Mandri couldn’t shake the feeling that the wall was daring him, like a schoolyard bully, to just try it and see what happens.
There was a squared-out arch in the middle of this wall, and underneath this arch was an ironwood gate guarded by two thugs on either side. These brawny men were huddled close to the gate so as to squeeze themselves inside the narrow shelter of the arch. It wasn’t doing them much good. They were as sodden as Mandri. Like everything else, the burgeonsight was making them sparkle. That didn’t stop them from looking like demons.
In the best of light, a Meskalimi thug’s face is an unsettling thing. A lifetime of trading violence for money fixes a man’s expression into a state in a permanent of concern, and once the brow and cheek gets slashed with scars, the whole thing takes on a look of putrefied misery. Blur that face a little with rain, twist it a little with burgeonsight, and you’ve got a demon’s face that could chill the bravest spine. And that’s what Mandri saw when he looked at those two thugs guarding Salavan’s gate, he saw full-blooded demons.
And they had swords—short, street-wise swords clipped high up on the belt.
It was hard for Mandri’s to fight back the thought that those two men really were demons. If he hadn’t seen a demon-witch fly into his ox and rip out its stomachs, he might have been able to do it. The logic was driven by the unsettling thought that Salavan might a greater demon than even Pell. That was a reasonable thing to expect, considering it was Pell who had told him to go to Salavan’s house, and if that was reasonable, then it was also reasonable to say that the two men guarding that gate weren’t men, because if Salavan was a demon, well, what demons do is they drag people to hell, they don’t employ them. 
It could be that these two were merely thralls caught in some enchantment.
Mandri’s mind ran through a number of other possibilities, none of them good. He settled, tentatively, on the idea that the burgeonsight revealed the truth and showed these ‘men’ for what they were: actual demons. They couldn’t be fully-fledged demons, because fully-fledged demons would be tasked with more important things than watching a gate. They would greasing the feet of backsliding priests, or tricking young beauties into thinking that taking it up the bum doesn’t count.
It then occurred to Mandri that he didn’t know why he was actually seeking out Salavan Soreen. Ostensibly, he was here to kill him, but until this moment, standing stupid in front of a blank white wall, he hadn’t actually considered that he could just not showing up. Pell had told him to go and see Salavan, and now here he was, seeing about Salavan. 
Perhaps he wasn’t fully in control of his own faculties.
Pell had puppeteered him.
Or it was the burgeons.
He looked at the two demons and asked them bluntly, “Are you demons?”
The two demons, faces swirling, laughed like he was a dog.
“Git yous butt gawn,” one of them said. His vowels were as stubborn as a mule.
Do demons have regional accents?
Is Shis that big?
Sounded more like this demon grew up in a sun-slum near Iskabat.
The other had no doubt crawled out of a Jeketian gutter. Insert jeketian detail.
Mandri caught his wits and said, “I’m here to see Salavan Soreen.”
The two demons looked at each other. Hackles up.
One of them asked, “Why?”
The other asked, “Whatchu gotta knife fur?”
Mandri looked down and saw that he was gripping his knife so tight that his knuckles were white. 
“Oh.. Uh… sorry.”
The demon from Iskabat pulled his short sword from its scabbard and he brandished it at Mandrameen. 
He said, “Come an get dem fingahs cut.”
Mandri stepped back and waved his hands in clear submission. He said, “I’m here because Pell sent me.”
“Pell sent you?” the Hrkan demon asked.
Mandri nodded.
“What’s your name?”
“Mandrameen.”
The Iskabati demon snorted and and Hrkan slouched up again against the gate. Evidently, they had been expecting him.
The Iskabati waved his sword and said, “Poop the lil’ hippy.”
“What?”
“Drop the knife.”
“Why?”
“Are you dumb? You’re not getting inside with a knife.”
It seemed unwise to give up the knife. If Mandri handed it over and passed through the gate, he’d be ambling into the clutches of a demon king without the means to defend himself.
Probably, he would die. 
What good was a Mandri wielded knife against a demon king?
He’d die with or without it.
He could run away.
Where would he go? He would probably die in a gutter within a week. And that wouldn’t work anyways, because no doubt Pell was slinking in the shadows somewhere nearby.
If there were alternative options, Mandri couldn’t see them. Burgeonsight has a rooting effect, it roots a person into the present, makes it hard to see into the future. There were an infinite number of possible paths his life’s direction could take, and presumably some of these didn’t lead to a quick death. Burgeonsight narrowed it down to just one: go through the gate.
Some people say that this is why burgeons are bad for a person’s spark. They say that burgeons make people ignorant of the future and so they don’t plan for it, and the next thing that happens is a ruined life. Mandri would argue that everyone walks through life’s infinite possibilities with their eyes set on a narrow array of options. So if sober people are ignoring an effective infinity, what’s the harm in taking a burgeon to ignore a couple more? At least he wasn’t trying to build walls—those literal embodiments of the restriction of possibility. What’s worse than burgeons is building a wall and funneling only the ‘good’ things through the gate. These people are higher on fear than Mandri had ever been on burgeons.
He dropped the knife.
The Hrkan demon opened the gate’s cutout door and motioned Mandri in.
The door clanged behind his head, and a shiver ran through his spine.
It’s amazing how fast he could come to regret a decision.

The two travelers happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Sand’s empty portion. They are hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundreds of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in space and time, in the most inhospitable desert, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance. He actually expects to find a bit of strangeness out in the great sand sea—after all, the desert is large but the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he’s stumbled upon and all he can see is the fulfillment of expectation. That’s all it is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, is stunned by the significance of the moment. She did not expect to see another person in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two sparks to meet in such a wasteland without planning it, well, it could not be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for a purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. It is nine long lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say that the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in a secret vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for providence to be revealed. Solitants preach that there must be another tablet, one which proves that the story is about Solraheen Himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. Maybe that man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Agreen believed. Actually, he went a little further. He believed that the man and woman never existed at all and that the story is a fable.
He’d tell anyone who’d listen to his liquored up sermons that this story, the raw events, they were not important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson there in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a few simple questions:
 What would have happened if the woman had journeyed into the desert and made it through safely without encountering a soul? 
Absolutely nothing. 
And if nothing had happened, would she have glimpsed the divine plan? 
Absolutely not.
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, and she wouldn’t have given a single thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety.
She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries.
She never would have shed a tear at the wonder of chance.
She never would have turned her eyes to the heavens and laced His name with magnificence.
And yet, Solraheen would have been there all the same.
“That’d be the lesson”, Seb would say. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. It is there in the pain, and it is there in the pleasure. To be struck dumb by the sight of the His plan in one case and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. 
Providence is always there.
Almost always there—there are some exceptions.
The key to seeing the plan is found by living in the present. The key to living in the present is found by getting rid of all expectations. Expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. 
Seb liked put it a little more bluntly: “Expectations will get ya up the ass”.
He said it, and that’s how it was.
Of course, none of this stopped him from having expectations himself. No one is perfect. Not even Solraheen.
Seb once stumbled upon a bald, aching, stiff-jointed pilgrim who claimed that if you don’t have righteous eyes then the next best thing to have is nothing at all. The pilgrim claimed to be able sit perfectly still and chant his mind into such a trance that his body required no food or water, nor even air, and more importantly, he said that his thoughts were free from expectations.
Seb tried to induce this meditative state in himself, but he couldn’t do it. He doubted the old pilgrim could either, at least not for any meaningful length of time. Sitting still and simply existing is what a rock does, and people aren’t rocks. People look at things, and when they look, they try to understand, and when they try to understand, the expectations inevitably come. But if that’s true, then how does one get to living in the present if expectations are inevitable?
Seb did not have a clean answer.
He could always just die and be reunified with the All-White Spark, but he could only try that once. Until that day came, Seb figured that the best thing to do was to err on the side of the woman traveler and expect as little as possible. At least she had some appreciation for divine mysteries.
Seb reasoned that having no expectations and expecting to not have anything were close enough to the same thing. They used a lot of the same words. Like if he took those words and put them in a bag and shook that bag around, then there’s no telling which idea he’d get out of it. Seb figured maybe life works that way. Maybe if he had an idea-enough-like-the-right-idea, then when life shook him up like it always did, he might pop on over to a more righteous kind of mind. Like how a shrimp is a lot like a fish, and if he put one on a hook and tossed it the water and waited for yank, then surprise, out pops a fish. There’s an Old Jandri quote that backed him up: “Put a lie on a hook and you’ll pull up a truth”. Maybe if he baited his hook with the crumb of an expectation, he’d pull up no expectations at all.
In the meantime he’d have to wait. And he’d keep his expectations low while doing it. This was easy for him to do, because thirty years of living in a desert land that most languages call Emptiness makes it easy to keep expectations as low as possible.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. He knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the Junei hills from rain, how the Utzal wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Burgos mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces looking down at you. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders. Chins tufted with thornscrub. It seemed like even the weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. The evidence was there in the foothills. If you got up into the ridges of the Hias and looked north towards the Junei Plain you could see the lighter orange clay of long-dried washes snaking through the red foothills for as far as there are foothills.
Of course, when you’re down in those foothills you don’t notice them. Down there you only see sun baked clay and that clay is so hard that you can’t imagine it had ever seen rain. One night, Seb spit on the ground and when he woke, five whole hands later, that glob of spit was still there. Ground was so hard his spit couldn’t seep into it. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi spines he chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. Just couldn’t deal with a good lovin’. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. Hateful. Nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and some little lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to sip the urine. 
Birds don’t count either because they’re just passing through. 
You could find beetles if you ripped the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes you’d have to bore into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and you can’t boil or steam the smell out, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that can keep you alive and the things that can kill you.
Everything else is nothing. 
There’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them—they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
That’s what Seb saw as he stood atop one of the Hias foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain—he saw nothing. Mostly he saw nothing because his eyes weren’t good at seeing way far out. It was all mostly a blur. But even if he could see he knew there wouldn’t be a horizon because it’d be lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only its not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed the Sand, because it looks like something, but really it’s nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.
“Oi, Seb! There's somethin ‘ere!”
Seb’s ears pricked at the words. The shout had come from a nearby ravine.
Quick and spry as a lizard zipped up on freeweed, Seb scrambled over to the lip of that ravine and leered down into its deep belly. 
One of his fellow Ayramun was standing there in the middle of it. All the Ayramun were swaddled from head to toe in brown or black wool dusted red by clay, but Seb knew it was Gugi down there because of the way he stood. Only Seb and Gugi stood with that twitchy restlessness that marks out a Jandri man who’s not stopped chewing the spines of borcandi leaves since the day they were weened off the tit. And Gugi was also a little taller than most. A little lankier. 
Gugi stuck his skinny arm up in the air and waved it towards Seb.
Seb sneered at the eagerness.
“Put your goddamned hand down,” Seb shouted. “I can see you just fine.”
“Then get your ass down here!” Gugi shouted back.
Seb harrumphed and then started his climb down into the ravine.
As far as ravines go it seemed as full of nothing as any other ravine. It was a little steeper than most, and it was dry and dusty so Seb’s feet couldn’t find purchase on the slope. He was forced into a clumsy half-scramble-half-slide to get down the bottom, which was about twenty yards down. Once there he took a moment to shake the out dirt that had fallen into his left boot.
The unexpected thing about this ravine was how even and straight it was. Almost like a road. It went straight as an arrow for a full fifty yards before getting lost around a bend. This run was speckled with the dried out husks of karkle bushes. They looked like big black cancerous growths. Gugi was standing in front of one of them, looking a little spooked.
Seb took his time ambling on over. He fingered a fresh borcandi spine out of his sleeve pocket as he went. He knew there wouldn’t be anything worth noticing because Gugi had a penchant for pointing out any old thing that caught his interest. Maybe there’d be a pricked-up drag-belly hissing inside that bush, but fat little lizards doing four-legged push-ups and flashing their ruddy throats weren’t worth shouting about. 
They weren’t something.
They were to be expected.
Part of the ignorable blur.
Gugi urged him on with an impatient flap of his hand. 
Seb laughed and said, “I ain’t gonna run in this heat.”
Gugi shook his head and mumbled something Seb couldn’t hear. 
“Pipe down, sun’s sake, I’m comin’.”
Seb eyed the karkle bush. There was definitely something hidden underneath its twiggy branches. A lumpy shape of something shadowed. A creature of some sort. Big, dark, unmoving, and apparently unconcerned with how Gugi was brushing the karkle’s branches aside to get a better look. 
“What is it?” Seb asked as he stepped next to Gugi.
“See for youself,” Gugi said as he parted the bush’s brambles.
Seb peered down into the bush’s shadow. His jaw went slack in surprise, and his barely-chewed borcandi spine slipped from his lip.
There was a goddamned dead body underneath that bush.
“Shit.”
“Ain’t it?”, Gugi said. “Ya know, this the first bush I looked under.”
“No.”
“Yep. It’s the first bush I looked under. I was like, this bush is in the perfect position, halfway-up, halfway-down, bet it will be the best spot to—”
“You sayin’ this is the first bush you looked under?”
“Yep.”
Gugi’s eyes weren’t lying. It was the first bush he’d looked under. There were at least forty other bushes in that dusty ravine, and the first one Gugi looks under has got a dead body in it. A quick glance around told Seb it was the probably the only one that had a dead body in it.
This was really something.
A strange coincidence.
A divine sign.
Seb’s skin prickled.
He pulled another spine out his sleeve, popped it in his mouth, and resumed his chewing with zeal. Spines helped him think. They helped him find the reasonable conclusions.
This could be a prank.
He eyed Gugi with suspicion.
Gugi was a prankster, had a prankster’s face—thin, a long crooked nose, restless eyes, bad skin, mostly it was in the way he chewed his spines, open-mouthed, provocative, and sorta sigh-smiling. It was nasty, the way he chewed, because the man’s teeth were rubbed down to black and yellow nubs. Seb’s teeth were like that too, but he had the good sense to keep his mouth shut. Even when he talked, his lips worked hard to make sure his teeth weren’t showing.
Gugi said, “Ain’t no blood.”
Seb looked down, and yep, the weren’t no blood.
Gugi started playing a game of point-and-see, like he was want to do.
“Got an arm,” he said. “A white tunic of somewhat. Skin don’t look too dried out none. Skinny, though.”
Seb squatted down to get away from Gugi’s inane observations. He peered under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“Gotta be a man,” he said.
“We sure he’s dead?”
“He’s not nappin’.”
Gugi squatted down next to Seb. “Help me get him out,” he said.
Seb asked, “Did you put this body here?”
“What? No.”
“Gugi. I’m only gonna ask one more time. Did you put this dead body here?”
It was hard to tell from Gugi’s face whether or not he had anything to do with it. The man was so well practiced in . Only Gugi’s eyes gave things away, and only then, it was only sometimes.
Gugi said, “You think I’d kidnap some random bit, haul his ass all the way out here, then kill him and stuff him up under this bush, just to stir you up?”
His eyes weren’t telling.
Sometimes, if Seb paused and stared hard at Gugi, the guilt would get to him, and he’d give it up. 
“I didn’t do shit! Damn. I found it here like I said.”
“Then who put it here?” Seb said. “The body is fresh as a baby’s bum. You think he just crawled up under here all by himself?”
“Could be. He’s prolly some pilgrim that was headed for the pass. Crawled up under here to seek shade and forgot to wake up.”
“If that’s what happened, it’s even worse.”
“Why’s that?”
“Because it means a god put him here. Or a demon. It’s providence, one way or the other. Could be curse.”
“It ain’t no curse. It’s just a dead body.”
“There’s no such thing as ‘just a dead body’. This goes with what I been sayin’ this whole time—we shouldn’t be tryin’ to do what we’re tryin’ to do.”
“Seb, if it’s a curse, then let’s move this curse somewhere else. I aim to use this bush. It’s the perfect spot.”
Seb couldn’t believe his ears. “You gonna hide in this bush?”
“I am,” said Gugi, without a hint of trepidation.
“You gonna hide in the one bush that’s got a dead body in it?”
“There won’t be no dead body when we move it. That’s why I need your help. Damn.” 
&quot;Have you lost your water? This the clearest shout of a cursed bush I ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this. ‘Cause if this is the place where—&quot;
&quot;Oh, don't worry Ayram ‘bout this shit. Just help me move the damn thing.”
“Gugi, how do you not see what’s goin’ on here?”
“Grab his foot.”
“Gugi, listen to me—do not hide in a bush that got’s a dead body in it. This is Solraheen tellin’ you that if you hide in this bush, then you gonna die.”
“Grab his foot.”
“No.”
“I grab one, you grab the other.”
Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of the dead left ankle. He stared at Seb and shook it around to show Seb just how tightly he was holding on without getting struck down by some maleficent bolt. The foot was pretty stiff on the ankle. The body hadn’t been dead too long.
“Now grab the other foot.&quot;
Seb shook his head. 
Gugi said, “You know this body here—this body is the perfect chance for you to get to bother Elrahet.”
“How’s that?”
“You don’t think an old witch don’t want to look over a dead body? I bet you bring a dead body with you, and now you got something to pester her with instead of you’re boring old self. Put a dead body next to her, and she ain’t gonna be able to shoo you away.”
It was a good point. After all, it was Elrahet who’d know what the body was about. Elrahet was one of the few who could see the divine plan, and Seb was one of the few who knew she could see it. She was why Seb was here amongst the Ayramun. It wasn’t cause of Ayram, big as he may be, it was because she had secrets that needed prying open.
“Maybe,” he said reluctantly.
“Help me carry the boy to Elrahet, and I’ll give you twenty spines.”
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. “Twenty?”, he asked.
Gugi nodded. “Twenty.”
Twenty was a lot of spines. A couple weeks worth. There was no telling when they’d be back in the putty hills and he could pick another fill.
“How about it?” Gugi asked.
“Alright.”
Seb bent down to do his part, but Gugi brushed him away, saying, “I’ll make it forty spines if you carry it yourself.”
“You ain’t got forty spines.”
“I’ll give you twenty spines, and my God’s Eye burgeons.”
“Give me twenty spines, and you tell me where you get your God’s Eye burgeons.”
“No chance. It’s twenty and the burgeons, and you carry this bit all the way to Ayram. Besides, it's a limp body. It's easier if just one of us carries him.”
“And how’d you come to figure that?”
“It’s a limp body. Throwin’ it over the shoulders is easier than one man gets the legs, one man gets the arms.”
“If it’s easier for one person, then what you call me over for?”
“Because I don’t wanna carry it.”
Seb’s brow tightened up again, and he asked, “Why not?”.
Gugi smiled. “Because it’s cursed,” he said.
This was why no one liked Gugi—he was never upfront about the way things were. He’d betray anyone he could, if anyone ever thought to trust him.
Seb nearly slapped him. “You thought you could get me to take up this cursed body for a measly twenty spines and some God’s Eye burgeons?”
“Am I wrong?”
Gugi’s face twisted into that annoying, presumptuous grin. Seb wanted nothing more than to break some of Ayram’s rules on that grin, but he thought better of it. Violence wasn’t the best thing to do here. Best thing to do was to take the grand scheme of things into account.
There was a cursed body under a bush, where no cursed body should be. 
Maybe he was looking at this all wrong.
Maybe that body wasn’t cursed.
He had stop consider his creed: Solraheen’s hand is there in the pain, and it’s there in the pleasure. Another way of putting that is to say that a curse could be a blessing, and a blessing could be a curse. There’s no way of knowing which is which until it all plays out. It’s expectations that get in the way. 
If he looked at all this with no expectations, and abstracted out the deadness of the body and the strangeness of the circumstance, then no doubt he would take Gugi’s deal. God’s Eye burgeons for a little bit of toil? 
The best thing to do was to take the deal.
He said to Gugi, “You ain’t wrong, but dammit, you know I’m gonna kill you someday.” 
“Whatever you say, Seb.”
“But before we do anythin’, you’re gonna gimme them burgeons.”
“I’ll give you the spines now, and the burgeons later.”
“Burgeons now, spines later.”
Gugi shook his head in annoyance, then pulled out a leather pouch from his robe and tossed it to Seb. Seb caught it, checked it, pocketed it, and then he crouched down, reached under the karkle’s twigs, grabbed both the boy’s dead ankles, and pulled.
The dead man slid right out. Body was half as heavy as Seb thought it’d be.
“He’s young,” said Gugi.
“Looks soft,” said Seb.
The boy was as skinny as a kid half his age, and he was clothed in nothing but a ragged white tunic smeared with dust and clay. Judging by the skin, the whites of the eyes, the stiff limbs, it really did seem like he’d only died that morning.
Seb grabbed the boy’s right arm and pulled it up and over his shoulder, and the rest of the body came with it. Seb settled the weight on his shoulders, like he’d do for a poached lizard, and before he left, he hocked up a huge wad of spit, and a spat it at Gugi’s feet.
“Sorry,” he said.
He didn’t stick around for Gugi’s mocking laugh. He headed south down the ravine, towards the Junei pass, towards the cliff where Ayram and his nearest were planning out the ambush that would end all ambushes.

Crueltence

Need to have seb’s bad eyesight made fun of.


Make Seb more skeptical of everything thats going on the previous chapter.

for as the Bound Book says:
An empty well is also filled with purpose,
An arrow in the dirt has also hit its mark,
He weaves all mysteries just below the surface,
If one had but righteous eyes to pierce the dark.

 His words were a little lost in between the squelches.

Make Elrahet CRAZY - she’s been here forever.

Elrahet - I hate questions. The amount effort it takes to ask a question is nothing compared the effort to answer.

Seb, your personality is like a weed. Every time I pull it out, it grows right back. —this is for Pell!



It’s not worth noticing strange coincidences because everything that happens is strange. 

He gestured to the sloped walls of the ravine. If a rock was big enough, or a divot in the earth deep enough, a fellow bandit was already settling in. Most were lying down up top, above the ravine's lip. 

“If you don’t squat down and do a part, I’m gonna start breakin rules.”

“Someone’s getting in this bush. There’s no time to be scrying and softing about what is and isn’t cursed.”

“I don’t want you to get in trouble. See, I’m gonna hike all the way back to Ayram, alone, and he’s gonna ask me what I’m doin there tellin him about a dead body instead of showin it to him. And I don’t want to blame you for not helping, but that’s the truth. And then he’s gonna make an example out of you.”

            <Text>
Every budding theologian looks for things that separates their religion from this rest. Ultimately, its a search for credibility. It feels like a proof to be able to say, 'every other religion believes the world is like this, and we're the only one that doesn't.' 
Solitants revel in this kind of reasoning. When they proselytize to unbelievers, they open with the fact that every single one of Jandri's religions begin with a story that explains the existence of suffering. 
The Supine Cult believes that there are just two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter.
The Havainu take on more personal responsibility, as they believe that suffering is a result of sins committed, whether it be one’s own sins or one’s ancestors.
The Shalkians believe that suffering is a symptom of Shalkhsahsar, which is a difficult concept to relate in so few words. It is often summarized as the inability to perceive the edgeless nature of reality.
There are a hundred more religions, with a hundred variations each, all scattered about the continent. All of them, every single one, offers not just a explanation for suffering, but, more importantly, a solution for it. 
Only the Solitants are unique. They don't offer a solution for suffering. They offer more of it. &quot;Suffering&quot;, a Solitant priest will say with comforting smile, &quot;is what this is all about!&quot;
In the rare event a Solitant priest happens upon an eager ear, they will go on to argue that the notion of ‘Life without suffering’ is a mere trick of language. It's a string of words that has semantic sense but no bearing on reality.
&quot;Life is suffering&quot;, they say. &quot;Try to suffer without suffering.&quot;
They laugh at the comic absurdity of it.
Then comes the version of this distilled for childlike audiences childlike distillate, like fruit juice from prunes.
They say that the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's marble. It is clean, abstract, inert. Then comes the sculptor's chisel; then comes pain. As the chisel carves away at the marble to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the human. There is no beauty inside a stone without a chisel, and there is no beauty inside our fleshy vessels without pain. It is our travails that define us.
Mandrameen hated Solitants. He hated suffering, so he hated Solitants. Solitiss was, in his eyes, the most toxic religion imaginable. At least the death cults that wandered the desert would do you a service and kill you before playing with your body. If a Solitant gets their hands on an adherent, well, Mandri had heard the stories. And besides, Mandri didn't find any of the their theology convincing. How it could be, for example, that a religion revolving around the concept of pain can have so few words for it? Solitants speak Common, their holy texts are written in Common, and in Common there's just the one word: pain.
If a person says, “I am in pain,” there’s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe? Did a loved one just die? Have their bowels been blocked for days, filling the innards up to bursting? Sure, the word ‘pain’ can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The word ‘anguish’ approaches something different, but that's not nearly enough. 
Some intrepid philologists go as far as to suggest that the language Solitants use actually stunts the growth of pain appreciation. They argue that a person can’t develop a sensitivity to the varieties of someone else's pain if there aren’t labels for them. But a Solitant priest will argue that there is no real need to develop a robust lexicon of pain because the natural language of gesture is far, far superior. There’s no need for a fuzzy word when you can see it all written on the face clear as day.
Observe the eye and brow. Is there langour, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety, havoc? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye’s lid puffy, or hollow, wet or dry, dark or pale, sallow of brown, or white, or purple? And then there’s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up to the face. The lower back knots up, then the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight to reveal a gnash of teeth. It doesn’t take an eye trained in physiognomical presentation to see all this and understand it, for pain is a primal thing. A person can look at another in pain and know, without knowing, their inner world.
All that is required is to pay attention.
Lizard-bit Mandrameen was wracked by a searing pain that shot up from his chewed leg. Moto wasn’t paying attention at all. He was too busy carrying Mandrameen. Step shot a pain as his legs flopped against Mandri’s arm.  Affronted by this brazen indifference, Mandri was forced to resort to language to let Moto know the state of things, and since Common lacked the word to accurately describe his condition, he was forced to make one up. 
“EeeauuughhhGoddammotherfuckingshityousonofabitch!”
It really rolls off the tongue, so long as one screams it. 

“Oh, shut up,” Moto said. “You did this to yourself.”
Mandri slammed Moto’s back with his fist. 
“Ho, no! You shit. Oh, yoooouuueeauughhhhh!”
Moto rolled his eyes and said, “I warned you.”
“Fucking put me down.”
“Hah!”
Moto drops. “Relax,” he said. “We’re here.”
Mandri craned his neck to try and see who it was that Moto was talking about. Outside the entrance of a cave. A lone outcrop of rock pit on the landscape. Entrance cant be seen behind a boulder.
The wound pulsing
Two other ayramun just chilling.
Mazyd.

We meet again.
“Shutup”

Agghhh, damn.
Keeps readjusting,
How you holding up there, Mandri?
.
Thought you’d be taking off.
That is a physical impossibility.
Just get up and go.
Theyve crushed my legs.
Reveals. Broken anles. Flop.
Doesnt that hurt?
Not if I dont want it to. One of the nice things about being a seilsi is that pain is optional.
Wish I could do that.
I might be able to help you out.
How could you do that? Got a nice numbing drink hidden in your robes?
I might. Can you show me your leg?
Mandri unwraps the wound.  Dark tendrils up the leg. Horrifying sight.
MMMhmm.. Succup drag belly bite. Looks like its heading towards your heart. How’s your chest feel?
Mandri shares a knowing look.
Ah shit.
Its alright, you happen to be in the one place you can be cured.
You got something?
Not me. These ayramun. If they brought you back to life, surely they have the capacity to stop you from dying. Relieve your pain at the very least.
I don’t know. They want shit from me. I just don’t like feeling, like, you know…It’s like, ulterior motives, man. Its something I hate. I can tell when they’re talking to me, there’s always some ulterior motive. Except for that Sob guy. He’s not exactly, you know…”
“I do.”
“I mean, there’s no reason for me to be out here other than these think I did something or know something and they… aaaghh damn this hurts”
“No, I understand. I feel the same way. I was created to be a tool. I would like for people to seek me out for who I am instead of what they can use me for. But people look at me, and that’s all they can see, a tool. A weapon. Rich and poor alike, I’m just a tool them.
Don’t worry, Oba, you’ll always be a demon to me.
Can I offer you some advice? It’s good advice. That’s one of my official functions, to dispense advice.
Well, I can’t stop you.
Tell these Ayramun what they want to know. I get the sense that you harbor no real secret, and that you’re simply being stubborn out of spite, but considering your leg, the time for that is long gone.
You think they’ll keep me alive even when they learn there’s no real use for me?
I do. These Ayramun, they’re good people.
Good people!? Look at what they’ve done to you! Look at me!
I thought a lizard did that to you.
Only because that Moto mother fucker threw me in a lizard pit!
Ah. I guess I should say, they’re good people considering the baseline state of people. That might be hard to understand, but-
Oh no, I get it.
You have to remember, life out here is rough. I’ve met people out here that stretch the very definition of a person. They’d be chewing on your leg already.
I guess you’re right.
I always am.
Don’t get carried away.
Like a human thing. A thing you know nothing about. A thing you need a Spark to understand.
I don’t know. Love.
Love? I could give you advice on love. Many a princeling has sought out the services of the Mazydai in that respect. Unfortunately, we are obliged to give it to them.
Yeah right.
I can see your heart flutter at the thought of a girl.
Pella
What would be your advice, then.
First, its to stop eating what they give you.
What, you think me of all people should lose weight?
No, it’s not about that. The cook, Moteah, she puts saltpeter in everything she makes.
I don’t follow.
Saltpeter quells the urge. Dulls the libido. Gives you sad uglies.


You didn’t happen to learn anything about our captors.
Did you?
No haven’t heard anything.

Sob comes from around the other side.
Moto! What fucking took you so long.
Where’s ayram.


Seeing them, Mandri summoned the courage to stifle his moans. It was now a sharp inhale through clenched teeth was a more manly way to deal.

Looked at the wound.
Looked at moto.
“What is this about?”
“It’s what it looks like. He got bit by drag-belly.”
“How?”
“He jumped into a lizard pit.”
“No I fucking didn’t!”
Elrahet tsk’d Mandri’s outburst awy, and when Mandri stammered a “But-“ Elrahet turned to him and yelled, “Quiet boy!”
Then she turned back to Moto.
Elrahet said, “Why, pray sun, did this boy jump into a lizard pit?”
“He threw a fit and jumped in. It’s like he’s got no will to live. He didn’t even try to fight the lizard off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.”
“Is that true, Chopper?”
Chopper held up the lizard head, and said, “I chop it.”
Mandri shouted, “He’s lying!”
Elrahet knocked Mandri’s leg with her cane, and that sent a fresh wave of pain up his hip and into his chest.
“It was an ill omen finding you dead in the hills. I heard whispers of demons and Shis. I have no ”
“Kill me then. I didn’t ask for this shit.”
“Like I said, the boy wants to die.”
Growing sneer as Elrahet sees this boy wasting his life.
“Is that all you know about him?”
“He wouldn’t talk much. He doesn’t seem to like me.”
Grunts.
“He had this on him.” Tossed the stone to Elrahet.
“What are you doing with a spot of Fabled Black?”
Mandri decided wtf to say.
“I don’t know.”
Elrahet attention jerked from the present.
“We haven’t got time for this. Moto, pick up the boy, and keep a hold on him this time.”
“No, no, no, no, no. “
Purl. 
“You’re kidding me, right?”
“Purl…”

Purl opens his thigh. Salve.



Look, can you do something about my leg? 


Describe her priestess of mid.
We should kill him right now.
Use your brain you little shit. If he is some dark prophesy, then even if we kill him, he’ll just come back. Doesn’t matter what we do. If he’s not, then we’ll have killed hapless young man in his prime
Ive already seen every inch of him, no curse.

“Is that what you think I am, an ill omen?”




Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
 “The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Rghiz is a long way off.

“Yeah.”
 “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.”

The word that doesn’t mean anything. Its a metaphysical word that requires a definition that we haven’t learned. Meant to highlight the limits of human reason. A deleuzian notion.

Foetic words. Category of not-yet-words. Needs a name, foetic words. And so this justifies the proof.

When a head and a book come into collision, and sound is hollow, is it always the book?
The intellect is merely the minister of foreign affairs. The will is dominant.

Our walking is nothing but a constantly prevent falling, our life is nothign but a constantly prevented dying, an ever post-poned death.

Genius is the knowldege triumphing over will
Thats why genius hates women - they seduce the natural will
Women cannot be genius, creatures of pure subject will 

What crime has these children committed that they should be born?


Apocraphyl lenin quote
Liberty is precious, so precious it must be rationed.


MANDRI to OBO- existence has no intrinsic joy.
The task of subsisting at all. If this is accomplished, life is a burden. And there comes the second task of doing something with that which has been won, of warding off boredom, which like a bird of prey, hovers over us and strikes when it sees a life secure from need. The first task is to win something, the second, to banish the feeling that it has been won, otherwise, it is a burdern. Human life must be some kind of mistake. The truth of this will become obvious when he consider that man is a compound of needs and necessities hard to satisfy, and  that even when they are satisfied, all he obtains is a state of painlessness, where nothing remains to him but abandonment to boredom. This is direct proof that existence has no value in iteslf, for what is boredom but the feeling of the emptiness of life. If life, the craving for which is the very essence of our being were possessed of any positive intrinsic value, there would be no such thing as boredom at all, mere existence would satisfy us in itself and we should want for nothing. But as it is we take no delight in existence except when we are struggling for sometrhing, and then distance and difficulties to be overcome make our goal look as though it would satisfy us, an illusion that vanishes when we reach it or else when we are occupied with some purely intellectual interset, in reality we have stepped forth from life to look upon it from the outside, much after the manner of spectators at a play and even sensual pleasure itslef means nothing but a struggle and aspiration ceasing the moment its aim is attained. Whenever we are not occupied in one of these but cast upon existence itself, its vain and worthless nature is brought home to us, and this is what we mean by boredom. The hankering after what is strange and uncommon and innate and inerraticable tendency of human nature shows how glad we are at any interruption of that natural course of affairs which is so very tedious.

THRASYMACHOS—PHILALETHES.
Thrasymachos. Tell me now, in one word, what shall I be after my death? And mind you be clear and precise.
Philalethes. All and nothing!
Thrasymachos. I thought so! I gave you a problem, and you solve it by a contradiction. That's a very stale trick.
Philalethes. Yes, but you raise transcendental questions, and you expect me to answer them in language that is only made for immanent knowledge. It's no wonder that a contradiction ensues.
Thrasymachos. What do you mean by transcendental questions and immanent knowledge? I've heard these expressions before, of course; they are not new to me. The Professor was fond of using them, but only as predicates of the Deity, and he never talked of anything else; which was all quite right and proper. He argued thus: if the Deity was in the world itself, he was immanent; if he was somewhere outside it, he was transcendent. Nothing could be clearer and more obvious! You knew where you were. But this Kantian rigmarole won't do any more: it's antiquated and no longer applicable to modern ideas. Why, we've had a whole row of eminent men in the metropolis of German learning—
Philalethes. (Aside.) German humbug, he means.
Thrasymachos. The mighty Schleiermacher, for instance, and that gigantic intellect, Hegel; and at this time of day we've abandoned that nonsense. I should rather say we're so far beyond it that we can't put up with it any more. What's the use of it then? What does it all mean?
Philalethes. Transcendental knowledge is knowledge which passes beyond the bounds of possible experience, and strives to determine the nature of things as they are in themselves. Immanent knowledge, on the other hand, is knowledge which confines itself entirely with those bounds; so that it cannot apply to anything but actual phenomena. As far as you are an individual, death will be the end of you. But your individuality is not your true and inmost being: it is only the outward manifestation of it. It is not the thing-in-itself, but only the phenomenon presented in the form of time; and therefore with a beginning and an end. But your real being knows neither time, nor beginning, nor end, nor yet the limits of any given individual. It is everywhere present in every individual; and no individual can exist apart from it. So when death comes, on the one hand you are annihilated as an individual; on the other, you are and remain everything. That is what I meant when I said that after your death you would be all and nothing. It is difficult to find a more precise answer to your question and at the same time be brief. The answer is contradictory, I admit; but it is so simply because your life is in time, and the immortal part of you in eternity. You may put the matter thus: Your immortal part is something that does not last in time and yet is indestructible; but there you have another contradiction! You see what happens by trying to bring the transcendental within the limits of immanent knowledge. It is in some sort doing violence to the latter by misusing it for ends it was never meant to serve.
Thrasymachos. Look here, I shan't give twopence for your immortality unless I'm to remain an individual.
Philalethes. Well, perhaps I may be able to satisfy you on this point. Suppose I guarantee that after death you shall remain an individual, but only on condition that you first spend three months of complete unconsciousness.
Thrasymachos. I shall have no objection to that.
Philalethes. But remember, if people are completely unconscious, they take no account of time. So, when you are dead, it's all the same to you whether three months pass in the world of consciousness, or ten thousand years. In the one case as in the other, it is simply a matter of believing what is told you when you awake. So far, then, you can afford to be indifferent whether it is three months or ten thousand years that pass before you recover your individuality.
Thrasymachos. Yes, if it comes to that, I suppose you're right.
Philalethes. And if by chance, after those ten thousand years have gone by, no one ever thinks of awakening you, I fancy it would be no great misfortune. You would have become quite accustomed to non-existence after so long a spell of it—following upon such a very few years of life. At any rate you may be sure you would be perfectly ignorant of the whole thing. Further, if you knew that the mysterious power which keeps you in your present state of life had never once ceased in those ten thousand years to bring forth other phenomena like yourself, and to endow them with life, it would fully console you.
Thrasymachos. Indeed! So you think you're quietly going to do me out of my individuality with all this fine talk. But I'm up to your tricks. I tell you I won't exist unless I can have my individuality. I'm not going to be put off with 'mysterious powers,' and what you call 'phenomena.' I can't do without my individuality, and I won't give it up.
Philalethes. You mean, I suppose, that your individuality is such a delightful thing, so splendid, so perfect, and beyond compare—that you can't imagine anything better. Aren't you ready to exchange your present state for one which, if we can judge by what is told us, may possibly be superior and more endurable?
Thrasymachos. Don't you see that my individuality, be it what it may, is my very self? To me it is the most important thing in the world.
  For God is God and I am I.
I want to exist, I, I. That's the main thing. I don't care about an existence which has to be proved to be mine, before I can believe it.
Philalethes. Think what you're doing! When you say I, I, I want to exist, it is not you alone that says this. Everything says it, absolutely everything that has the faintest trace of consciousness. It follows, then, that this desire of yours is just the part of you that is not individual—the part that is common to all things without distinction. It is the cry, not of the individual, but of existence itself; it is the intrinsic element in everything that exists, nay, it is the cause of anything existing at all. This desire craves for, and so is satisfied with, nothing less than existence in general—not any definite individual existence. No! that is not its aim. It seems to be so only because this desire—this Will—attains consciousness only in the individual, and therefore looks as though it were concerned with nothing but the individual. There lies the illusion—an illusion, it is true, in which the individual is held fast: but, if he reflects, he can break the fetters and set himself free. It is only indirectly, I say, that the individual has this violent craving for existence. It is the Will to Live which is the real and direct aspirant—alike and identical in all things. Since, then, existence is the free work, nay, the mere reflection of the will, where existence is, there, too, must be will; and for the moment the will finds its satisfaction in existence itself; so far, I mean, as that which never rests, but presses forward eternally, can ever find any satisfaction at all. The will is careless of the individual: the individual is not its business; although, as I have said, this seems to be the case, because the individual has no direct consciousness of will except in himself. The effect of this is to make the individual careful to maintain his own existence; and if this were not so, there would be no surety for the preservation of the species. From all this it is clear that individuality is not a form of perfection, but rather of limitation; and so to be freed from it is not loss but gain. Trouble yourself no more about the matter. Once thoroughly recognize what you are, what your existence really is, namely, the universal will to live, and the whole question will seem to you childish, and most ridiculous!
Thrasymachos. You're childish yourself and most ridiculous, like all philosophers! and if a man of my age lets himself in for a quarter-of-an-hour's talk with such fools, it is only because it amuses me and passes the time. I've more important business to attend to, so Good-bye.

Self-Portrait is impossible.
Why is it that, in spite of all the mirrors in the world, no one really knows what he looks like?
A man may call to mind the face of his friend, but not his own. Here, then, is an initial difficulty in the way of applying the maxim, Know thyself.
This is partly, no doubt, to be explained by the fact that it is physically impossible for a man to see himself in the glass except with face turned straight towards it and perfectly motionless; where the expression of the eye, which counts for so much, and really gives its whole character to the face, is to a great extent lost. But co-existing with this physical impossibility, there seems to me to be an ethical impossibility of an analogous nature, and producing the same effect. A man cannot look upon his own reflection as though the person presented there were a stranger to him; and yet this is necessary if he is to take an objective view. In the last resort, an objective view means a deep-rooted feeling on the part of the individual, as a moral being, that that which he is contemplating is not himself24; and unless he can take this point of view, he will not see things in a really true light, which is possible only if he is alive to their actual defects, exactly as they are. Instead of that, when a man sees himself in the glass, something out of his own egotistic nature whispers to him to take care to remember that it is no stranger, but himself, that he is looking at; and this operates as a noli me tang ere, and prevents him taking an objective view. It seems, indeed, as if, without the leaven of a grain of malice, such a view were impossible.

What makes people hard-hearted is this, that each man has, or fancies he has, as much as he can bear in his own troubles. Hence, if a man suddenly finds himself in an unusually happy position, it will in most cases result in his being sympathetic and kind. But if he has never been in any other than a happy position, or this becomes his permanent state, the effect of it is often just the contrary: it so far removes him from suffering that he is incapable of feeling any more sympathy with it. So it is that the poor often show themselves more ready to help than the rich.

            <Text>Somewhere
gnise him to be salava
Seb can see auras. Being able to see an aura is the only thing that lets you distinguish between which god you’re serving.
Pre ambush
	- Mandri wanders into the sand and dies
	- body discovered by seb and gugi as they are setting up an ambush.
	- recognise him to be salavan’s son
	- takes him to pella.
	- pella is like, this is fucked
	- moto is like, this caravan is odd.
		-rock crystal lens.
	- pella is like, the boy might be a sign.
	- need to bring him back and question him.
	- gugi. I’m going to need your spark.
	- Seb argues. Gugi accepts. 
		- you argue with me, boy?
		- No. 
	- Cut him open. Spark of life transference.
	- mandri wakes up. Startled. Finds it difficult to speak.
	- Interrogation, mandri said he’s just a pilgrim. reveals that mandri’s dad is the one that sent them out there. They’re all out there because of salavan.
	- do we go through it ornot? Little argument. Pella gets a little hissy. MAYBE pella doesnt want to do it. Moto says yas. Pella gives ayram a signal that she’s disagreeing fakely, wants ayram to overrule her. Give him a signal that you don’t pick up until much later when she gives Mandri/Moto/etc. The same signal.
	- Ayram shows up. Says its on. Not least they need a prisoner to give Gugi a spark. You made that decision when you cut gugi open.

Ambush
Ambush in a ravine is set up. Target is a gold caravan. Much is made of the source of the information, salavan saran. When Lafri sees ordered riders, theres some trepidation, but they decide to go through with it anyways. The witch Elrahet summons a fog - no rain, no mud, no thunder. It will have to do.
Caravan come through ravine, arrows fly, Hrkans circle up. Aren’t even firing back. Just holding ground. From there ranks comes a mage. Dudes dying around- obliterates both sides of the ravine. Mandri sees Lafri get disentegrated. The hillside is dug out. Rocks melted.
Everyone dead but Mandri. All is still. Beam and bandit disintigrates. One by one they’re getting picked off. Shelter in place. The slightest whisper. Pella shrieks. Beam up the cliff. Then mandri sees  She screams, body bursts, then an orb shoots at troops and explodes him. Mandri is only person alive. Walks to rim of crater, sees teh mage unhurt but unconscious.
Pyetle’s Field
Pyetle languishing in his field. Accompanied by a scribe Soreel. Pyetle is drunk, just kind of rambling about the mistakes of the gods. Soreen stops him, says its time for you to come back with me. Says he needs to work off his debt. Salavan Saran has purchased it. He is to work in Salavan’s brewery - make the best brews.
Pyetle is like, fuck salavan. No way am I working for that rich asshole. Soreel is like, its already done. You’re coming. Pyetle says he’d rather kill himself. Soreel kind of flips shit. Says you’re coming one way or another. She pulls a knife on him. Threatens to kill Pyetle’s ox. ‘Not your ox anymore’. Soreel kills the ox. Ox bolts then collapses. Pyetle hits Soreel in the head and knocks her out. Mercy kills his ox, then heads out to salavan’s house.
 

Mudwater
Pyetle gets super drunk. Goes to Mudwater, goes to Salavan’s house.  Salavan is surprised to see pyetle alone. Asks where soreel is. Starts convo about business interests. Tries to get at pyetle’s recipe. Kind of rags on pyetle and his failures in life. Pyetle is like I was going to come and kill you, but you’re just a dick. Sal is like, you’re not going to work for me? No. Where the fuck is soreel?
Salavan then tries to kill pyetle. Gets close to doing it, until pella/mandri/ayram/hill show up. At first it’s just pella. Salavan immediately changes his tune. Super worried. ‘Tell ayram I didnt know.’ ‘Tell him yourself.’ Ayram shows up, salavan just kind of melts. Ayrams presence gets salavan to spill his guts. Then mandri kill him.


 Underworld
Pyetle follows the theives into the underworld. Along the way there are some strange doors that ayram and pella go into. ‘Underworld?’ ‘the place is more prosaic than the stories - but also much stranger’. Mandri, Hill, and Pyetle chill outside. Introductions. Magics? Piss hole. Pyetle falls/jumps in. 
Seculla Home
Danserd is in garden fretting over plants.

Senate Trial
In cart with sister-in law. Sister in law giving a run-down of what is going on - they’re going to pin the loss of mazyd oro on you. You know the knife they’ve been looking for? This is it. I told you so.
Little strategy session.

Reveals Mazyd Oro is missing. Who is responsible. Seculla was responsible for the mission.
Pit Cave
Pyetle is put in prison w/ mazydei, who is in bad condition. Bit of a bonding moment between the two. Mazyd reveals himself to pyetle.
They two are pulled out of their little cave and brought out to a pit cave, where some of the Ayramun sit. Somber atmosphere. Disgust directed towards mazyd. Pyetle gets taken under the wing of moteah, who gives him some food. Brief descriptions of characters -lizard brothers, moto, sob, ayram, pella, hill, suri. Pyetle gets some cloths from sob. Talk about luck. Maybe mention one of the lizard brothers goes up top to scout.
Where are the rest of the ayramun? At camp, hunting beasts.
Pit Attack
Pella and Ayram walks out into the pit, ayram interrogates mazyd. Mazyd hits right back. Interrogation interrupted by a body dropping down into the dirt. Its the ayramun sentry.
Look up, theres a few heads looking down. One standing there with a recurve bow - its an ambush. Shoot sob to prove they don’t have a chance to run away. Pull the ayramun up as prisoners. 
Once up they do a blood bomb to collapse the cave. ‘We’ve got a long way to go. Dont want any of you in there’. Then they try to blow up, of all people, mazyd.
Mazyd manages to take the shade with him. Mazyd is split in half, but still alive. Ayramun pick him up and head towards minting rock.

Minting Rock
Where band melts shit into coin. 2 areas - spring, and smelter. Pyetle is ordered to help Mandri and purl to melt down what they’ve got. Mandri starts to despair and complain. Pyetle chuckles at his naivety. Interrupted by something hiding in the coal.
The three flee the scene thinking theres some kind of demon in there. Ayram and pella et.al. Come running. Dont go in there. But Mazyd is in there. While arguing, black figure comes out and says hello, im no demon. Everyone is like wtf is this.
—
Mazyd is conscious - oh look at that. Pyetle spins around - mazyd is like spin me back around. Oh its another shade. Ayram is like fuck.

Journey in the desert
Ayram and co. Set up a trap for their pursuers by using creatures. Lizards. Set up bait.  Using physiology of creatuers to lure them onto pursuers. Maybe purl gets pricked with something - she offers herself as trap because she knows she’s dead anyways. 
Opportunity for moto to show his quality. Dispatches one shade. The other runs away.  Need to wait out creatures feasting on the bodies. Then foreign Jandrimun tribe people come and clear out the creatures.


Captured
Brought to old temple. turns out the jandrimun are a death cult. They consume the unfinished corpses of the ayramun’s pursuers. Put into cages. Ayram is brought before the big dude. Big dude is like, can’t fucking wait to eat you. Bet your flesh is god-tier. Ayram explodes, killing everyone. Pella picks her way out of the cage. She runs over to ayram and picks him up. Tells other ayramun to clear away some rubble.
Holy fuck theres an entrance to the underworld down there.
Escape
Pella rushes into the underworld to heal ayram. She follows strange writings in the dark. The reach door, she goes in with him. 
Everyone is like, damn, ayram is the shit. Mazyd is like, this is fucked. You wonder how the hell she knew that the underworld entrance was there?  She fucking knew where to go. It’s not ayram. 
Try to end on emotional note, where pyetle finds purpose in the sense-experience of being a human being. Foreshadowed by convo with mandri perhaps - awe/love/adrenaline/etc. Maybe the beauty of the struggle. Learns it from mandri dying or something. Mandri’s death, the fight for what he loved, was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. 

Gbenga akinnagbe = moto




Ayram comes out, is shook up. Pella is all snappy.  Help him. Leads them out. They see Jandri out in the distance. Massive city. Tents spread out.

            <Text>Finding Elrahet was easy because she never moved much from where she sat down, and that morning Seb had seen her sit down at the ambush sight-spot. Getting up to where she was, however, was difficult. Seb could either climb up the steep cliff face, or he could take the long way, and since he had to carry a dead body, he took the long way. He followed the Junei road up into the mouth of the Junei pass, then instead of following that road through the mountains and all the way south to Meskalim, he hopped off onto a smuggler’s trail which snaked up into the Hias. Not long after getting on that trail, he hopped off to follow a path which Ayram had made, one which double-backed towards the north.
It was nearing mid-day when Seb made it to the that wide, mid-cliff ledge where Elrahet was sitting. As far as ambush sight-spots go, it was perfect—it offered a privileged view of everything north of the Hias mountains. Below was the mouth of the Junei Pass, out of which the Junei road poured. This unkempt road meandered down into the dark Junei hills, where it was then dissected into a filigree of footpaths that wiggled down into the valleys and bent around black screes and outcrops of rock before shoot through the ravines and bowing along the bottoms of the wide, long-dry washes before emptying out, at last, into the Junei plain. Once out on the plain, all roads get lost because the white ground is a rocky caliche that gets swept clean by the strong Junsi wind.
Elrahet was alone up on that high ledge. To Seb’s eyes, she was nothing but a bundle of black rags and long smoky hair sitting cross-legged and communing with the vastness of the world. That was an overdone way of describing a person who’s sitting and watching and waiting for some people to kill, but Seb knew that a woman such as Elrahet was incapable of merely sitting, watching, and waiting; there was always some lofty purpose to her actions.
“Took you long enough,” she said.
Seb ambled up next to her. He didn’t wait to catch his breath before saying, “Gugi found a dead body and—”
“I know.” 
Seb briefly wondered how she knew, because she hadn’t yet looked at him. Then he realized that this was, after all, the sight-spot, and it had a good angle on just about every ravine, including the one with that cursed karkle bush.
“Bring it here,” she said.
Seb knew bloodwitches were cantankerous creatures, but Elrahet was especially cantankerous. She was old as old can be. Seb had not yet figured her exact age, though numbered age was rarely a thing that people of the Sand kept track of. A sand dune has no age, and outland witches like Elrahet were just as elemental. Her features were as dark, sharp, and solemn as any slab of shale. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown, leathered, and wrinkled as the bark of any pepperwood tree. Her layers and layers of black rag-robe pillowed her knobbly frame and made her look like a crow. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the Hias mountains themselves, and probably as old.
“Do I have to command your every twitch? Put the body down.”
Seb put the boy down gently, trying hard not to annoy her. He didn’t want her to shoo him away before he’d heard what she had to say. It was his purpose in life to ,but it was his mission to hear what she had to say. This was difficult purpose, because not only did Elrahet harbor disdain for mankind in general, she seemed to hate Seb the most. And why shouldn’t she? She could see the plan. She knew what he was. And when she did speak, she spoke softly, hoarsely. Her throat croaked like a dying man. All her sentiments were brusque and rude. All her sentences were death sentences. 
Then there was her bloodspeech. That’s what Seb called her absent-minded witchy mumbling. He called it bloodspeech because because whenever she got to speaking it, his own blood got to tingling, just as it was tingling now, because as soon as the boy was laid down she got to work probing his body for signs whispering that cursed bloodspeech.
Her study started with the extremities, the fingers and toes, then she worked her way up the fore-arms, her fingers tracing veins, and then she worked her way over the ankles and up the lower-lower legs. When she got to the dead boy’s knees, she ordered Seb to take off the dead boy’s tunic. This Seb did with some difficulty, as Elrahet was not inclined to help. Once it was done, and the boy was naked, Elrahet began her study anew.
There was an odd black birthmark on the boy’s chest. Elrahet squeezed it between her bony fingers as if to pop it off. Then she picked through his mop of black hair like a mother looking for lice. Then she cupped his uglies, but there was no great providence there, and next she tucked her thumbs into her palms and set all eight fingers to work in palpating the boy’s belly. When she got to jabbing her fingers up under the boy’s ribs, Seb had had enough of being kept in the dark. 
“Why don’t ya just cut him open?” he asked, though he’d forgotten to stop chewing his borcandi spine as he asked it, so his words were a little lost in between squelches.
Elrahet looked at him crossly. Her incurable sneer strained the tendons in her neck.
“Busy yourself,” she said.
Seb stepped away and privately cursed himself for not handling the situation with more tact. He should have expected less. Elrahet was impossible to please. In the first few months of Seb’s journey with the Ayramun, he’d tried winning her over with kindness; he’d make her meals, wash her blankets, carry her things, and for all that she called him a ‘servile oaf’. If he ignored her entirely, then that only enraged her. If he did what she wanted, exactly how she wanted it, and then he was just another non-entity to her. It had been three whole years and as many months, and Seb had learned almost nothing from her.
The only bit of wisdom he’d ever heard her say was said to Purl. Purl had been pouting about some useless thing and Elrahet said to her, “Every weakness is a strength, and every strength, a weakness.” If anyone else had said something as stupid as that, Seb would have disregarded it as merely twisting words. Strength is strength. Weakness is weakness. Seb’s eyes, for example, were a weakness. If a thing was up close he could keep it sharp, but ‘way far out’ and ‘not too far off’ were smashed together into a blurry haze he called ‘out there somewhere’. He looked out on the Junei plain from that high ledge, and all he saw was a wash of white ground underneath a blur of blue sky.
The only good thing that came of his unreliable eyes was that he never had to stand watch, and while he took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, calling that a strength was merely twisting words. When a man is strong he doesn’t need to twist words. For a witch steeped in the mysteries of the all-white-spark to say a thing like that, to say ‘weakness is a strength’, then there had to be some deeper purpose underneath the surface. Elrahet only ever spoke to bend the world to her will. Her words might have been for Purl, but Seb had overheard it, and him overhearing it was no doubt as much a part of  her intentions than if the she’d said the words to him directly. She was setting him down a path. Seb was sure of it.
One day Seb realized that the only other person he’d ever known who’d had vision worse than him, without being completely blind, was his old aunt Sesha. Old Sesha saw splotches of light and shadow and that was it. But if she stared at a person for long enough, and got all glassy eyed, then she would begin to see bands of radiant color resolving into the outline of the person. She called it aurasight. She saw red or black for killers and thieves and the like, green or blue for gentle folk, gold for the merely curious, and so on. It was an invaluable skill. 
Seb figured that maybe normal sight gets traded for aurasight. Or maybe aurasight is in everyone, in him, but he’d have to want it badly to get it, and no one could want a thing as bad as someone who’s got nothing at all, and so going blind is something of a prerequisite—this had to be what the old witch was getting at, that Seb’s own lack of sight would lead to wanting aurasight all the harder. It all fit. It was only a matter of time and effort. 
Whenever Seb tried to see auras, he’d mimic what he’d seen his old aunt Sesha do. She would stand as still as a statue and stare without focus. She’d get all shaky and sweaty as if she were killing herself with the effort. Seb wasn’t sure what was going on inside her head. It seemed simple, like all she was doing was narrowing the world down to just her and her target, and then, through vein-popping concentration, she’d will the auras into existence.
Seb stared out at the Junei plain and tried to find the coming caravan by it’s aura. He knew the caravan was out there somewhere in that blur, making its way towards the Junei pass to be set upon by the Ayramun. He let his eyes cross just enough so that the white landscape doubled and blurred until the edge between the sand and the sky softened into a clean gradient of white-to-blue. He began to strain himself, because at that point there was nothing else in the world but him and the distant caravan— if it was truly there at all. He supposed it was there, and he supposed that supposing it was there was enough to make the connection.
He stared into that blur and bore the look of a man possessed—jaw clenched tight, breathing in sips, skin tingling, muscles tense. He could feel the energy screaming out of his eyes, he was scouring all the world with it. He trembled as old Sesha trembled. Sweat beaded on his brow. 
Then he caught a faint whiff of an curious odor. A foul odor. Was it him? It could be the dead boy. Or old Elrahet. 
He took another sniff and was hit with a familiar musk—it was him.
He mumbled a curse.
And there were some nesting brightbeaks, up on the cliff behind. Seb knew this without looking because when brightbeaks jump out of their holes they flap their little wings so hard that it beats a pathetic, warbling whistle out of their tiny chests. One flew right by his ear.
But that brightbeak wasn’t the most distracting thing, that honor went to the way in which the borcandi juice sat in his mouth and stimulated the production of saliva. For this reason borcandi spines are called the dead-man’s drug, because borcandi bushes only grow in arid places, sucking at desert fog, and arid places are the worst place to chew them because when you’re milling about in the desiccating heat you want your water in your body not welling up in the mouth. Swallowing it all down is difficult because borcandi juice is bitter and doesn’t play nice with the stomach, so people spit it out. 
Seb could have spat the spine out, but he didn’t want to because that would be a waste. He didn’t want to put it in his pocket for safekeeping because once something leaves the mouth it didn’t seem right putting it back in. That’s the one thing that separates man from beast—if Seb ever caught someone spitting something out and putting it back in, well that person was not to be trusted. That’s something Gugi would do. Gugi would wolf down a roasted redtail, chew and chew, then spit it all out to pick out the bones. Then he’d season that pinkish-greyish mash with whatever was at hand, sometimes it was just a sprinkle of sand, and he’d plop it back into his mouth.
After the winceful image of Gugi’s most recent regurgitation passed through Seb’s mind, he realized that he’d completely forgotten about what he was trying to do: see the aura of the coming caravan. 
He cursed himself again. 
He wasn’t going seeing shit out on Junei plain.
He wasn’t going to see aurasight.
He couldn’t concentrate hard enough, for long enough.
This was another weakness of his—he was incapable of sustained concentration. He couldn’t hold onto a thought if he were alone in a pitch-black cave. People said this jumped-upness was because of all the spines he chewed, but Seb knew it wasn’t that because he’d always been like this. And he’d never once been in a position where his fitful mind could be deemed a strength. Gugi had said that if his mind was always jumping around then at least that means he can’t be sad for too long, and so he should be happy about that, but somehow that wasn’t true—being sad was the one thing Seb could be for too long.
He leaned over the cliff face and spat a loogie down. He watched it fall with some delight, though he was denied the pleasure of seeing it splat on the rocks below because the ground was far enough away to be ‘out there somewhere’.
That’s when Moto came scrambling down to sight-spot from some hidden perch up above.
Seb disliked Moto. Moto, a black man from Zos, was stronger, younger, and more skilled than Seb in every way imaginable. He was too well put together to be an Ayramun. Everyone else made do with dark, patchwork robes and nail-strapped soles for shoes, whereas Moto had thin silver metal buckles on his dusty black boots, and he wore an orange robe that was tucked and folded into sharp knife pleats that slanted across his chest and were kept secured by a wide and tight black sash around the belly. Moto was so clean and fastidious that he would have been at home in the upper rete of Hrkan society. He even had a sword, a long, curved sword inside a brass-studded scabbard—it even had a name. Worse than all this, he had healthy teeth. Few things made Seb more aware of his own disgusting self than being in the presence of healthy teeth. A man is hard done up when a smile does nothing but make him jealous.
Moto said to Seb, “You can’t see them, can you?”
Seb tried not to think about how his own futile attempt to peer into the distance was more interesting to Moto than the freshly dead body of a unfamiliar boy laying right there at his feet.
“I can’t see shit,” said Seb.
Moto chuckled and said, “They’re there. They’re on their way. Exciting, isn’t it?” He then looked down at Elrahet, and addressed the “Who is that?”
Loath to be interrupted, Elrahet grumbled out a barely-audible answer, saying, “He’s a complication.”
“A complication? What does that mean?”
“Means what it means.”
Seb chuckled. The old woman’s ways were funny when they weren’t directed at him.
“I need to know what ‘complication’ means,” said Moto. “The mazyd will be here before long.”
Elrahet tore herself from her task and squinted out at the horizon. She said, “I don’t see anything.”
“They’re there.” Moto pointed out into the blur and said, “There’s a tiny black speck and a faint cloud of dust just there. That would be them. That would be our target.”
“You sure that’s them?” Seb asked.
“Who else could it be?”
“Could be anyone.”
“Salavan said that the Mazyd lord and his Minder were making for the pass and the two would be hiding themselves in a blackwood caravan. Salavan said they’d be coming mid-day today.” Moto pointed to the desert again, this time with two imploring hands. “There’s a blackwood caravan out there. It’s mid-day. It all fits. That’s who we’re hunting.”
Seb spat another loogie off the cliff and asked, “Did old Salavan say anythin’ about a dead body?”
“No,” Moto said defensively. “Are you saying something about a dead body?”
“I’m not sayin’ nothin’, I’m lookin’ at it.”
“Yes, I see it too. What I don’t see is why it changes anything.”
“If there’s a curse in that ravine, then Ayram should know about it.”
“Who said anything about a curse?”
Seb looked to Elrahet for support. Elrahet simply grunted and said, “Unexpected bodies are foul omens.”
“Damn right,” said Seb.
Moto clicked his tongue in defiance. “Everything is a foul omen to you,” he said. “A rock stuck in your shoe is a foul omen. A dead leaf is foul omen. Unless Elrahet thinks there’s something more here, then it doesn’t change anything.”
“How’s it not change nothin’? How’s findin’ a dead body not notch on your ___?”
“I’ve got more important things to worry about.”
“Yeah, like how Mazyd lords are known for spreading lies about their comings and goings. They’re schemers.”
“Are you suggesting something?”
“Could be that there’s no Mazyd in them merchants at all.”
“If that’s true, then we knock off a few fat bellies and we get a little richer. What’s the problem?”
“Could be that those aren’t merchants, but a party of Hrkan skila in disguise!”
“If it’s skila, then we’ll have rid the world of a few more Hrkan boots.”
“Could be a Mazyd and some skila. What then? Or should we take on the whole Hrkan army?”
“Why would a Mazyd have skila with him? The Mazydai think they’re untouchable. They don’t need some pompous guard to protect them. And let’s say he did have skila with him—a few soldiers won’t change the balance.”
“What if it’s more'n a few?”
“Then we’ll kill more than a few.”
“Say this works, and Ayram takes out the Mazyd afore he gets to burstin’, then how many skila do you think we can take out on our own?”
“It doesn’t matter because it’s not skila that’s coming, it’s blackwood men.”
“How many blackwood can we handle?”
“As many as is coming.”
“How many is that?”
Moto rolled his eyes and then pulled a small, red leather purse from out of his robe. Seb’s eyes went wide at sight of it, for inside that pouch was a ribbon of black silk, and folded inside that silk were two rock crystal lenses set inside thick brass rings. These rings were joined together by a dangling a chain that when stretched was the length of Seb’s forearm. Moto never let Seb touch these lenses, and Seb hated him for that. If those two lenses, set in array, could magnify the distance and make the horizon seeable, well, Seb wanted to have a look.
Moto sat down on the edge of the cliff then propped his elbow up on one knee and let his other leg dangle free. He hunched over, put the smaller lens up to his eye, then stretched out the other lens as far the chain would let, and began his squinting study of the distant blur.
Seb didn’t like that Moto was sitting that way. It wasn’t just the lenses, it was the casual disregard for what Seb was capable of doing. In a flash, Seb could be right behind him and push him off the cliff. Seb could end him right there. For all of Moto’s skill and style, Seb could end him here. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. Could do it while Moto slept. While he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.
“I count count them exactly, but it looks like there’s fifty-four of them. Give or take.”
“Fifty-four’s more’n most,” said Seb.
“And fifty-four is exactly how many Salavan said there’d be…. though there is an odd fix about them.”
“An odd fix?”
Moto squinted again. He was evidently having trouble keeping his quarry in focus.
“It’s like they’re…well…They’re a blackwood guard alright, but it’s like they’re marching in squares.”
Seb’s ___. He said, “Blackwood guard don’t keep a column.”
“That’s why I say it’s an odd fix.”
“It’s odd fix ‘cause they ain’t no blackwood guard.”
“Eight wagons,” Moto said. “Exactly how many Salavan predicted.” 
Seb screwed up his face in thought. Eight wagons was several more than the average blackwood train. Predicted, maybe. But a merchant guard marching in tight formation? Caravan hands in this part of the Sand were ragged bands of backwash from distant Hrkan conquests, not the kind to march in squares.
These were skila, Seb was sure. Fifty-two skila and a goddamned Mazyd were bearing down on them. And How many more men might be hiding in those wagons? Thirty?
Seb compared all this to what the Ayramun brought to bear. Thirty-three bows. And Ayram. A Hrkan imbalance by big margin. This being an ambush did balance things a bit. The Junei hills were the most ideal place to bushwhack a column of Hrks. Everywhere the slopes were steep, and no matter which particular route was taken into the pass there were places where a strong arm would have a clean shot at the whole enemy column—that’s assuming the whole column was dumb and tried to stuff through all at once. If they packed into a particularly devilish ravine, then they’d have a hell of time trying to fight back. They’d be forced to run, forwards or backwards, and like always they’d run backwards—they think they know what’s behind them. And if it’s a real devilish ravine, the road won’t be wide enough for the wagons to turn around and beat a hasty retreat. Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Seb was not so sure. There was a good deal more of them than there were Ayramun. Maybe three to one. And that’s assuming the Mazyd got taken down without too much trouble. 
Moto said, “I’d take them for skila, but even from here you can see they’re wearing that ragged brown wool of the blackwoods.”
“Could be they been drilling common hands,” said Seb.
“That could be.”
“Could be that those really are Hrkan troops.”
“But they’re wrapped in brown wool,” said Moto.
“So? A man can change his clothes.”
Moto shook his head. “A Hrkan man doesn’t drop his whites for convenience, not even for subterfuge. It’d be a black mark.”
“The Sand makes converts of us all,” said Elrahet. 
Moto ____. He said, “Puffed up pride is the only thing a skila has. Once a soldier earns the white robe, he’s not going to take it off.” He put his eye once more to the lens and, then acquiescent shrug. “Still, even if they’re wearing brown, they could be fighting men.”
Seb said, “They could be rabble, and they could be eighty skila.” 
“I said fifty-two.”
“What about them wagons? Could be more of ‘em hidin’ in them wagons. And what’s more, if they’re skila, then they got skin in the game.”
Elrahet was thinking the same. “They won’t run when the killing starts,” she said.
“And the way we’re set up—”
“I know,” said Moto. “This only works if they try to run… actually, it’s only safe if they run, but even then it’s not really safe. This is a game of risk. This is a Mazyd we’re dealing with.” 
“Then it’s decided,” Seb said. “It’s off.”
“It’s not for you to call, Seb. You’re not the big man around here.”
“You ain’t either.”
“Ayram put me in charge. Likely as not, this is the only opportunity we’ll have to catch us a Mazyd, and Men marching in formation aren’t enough to call this off.”
“What about the dead body?”
“It’s a dead body?”
Seb was stumped. Moto wasn’t the type to go in for intuition unless it was his own. He might listen to Elrahet, but she wasn’t being helpful. In fact, she was remarkably passive considering the circumstances. Her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow would send it cracking into sharp relief, and at the moment there was only the faintest hint of that familiar sneer. She was watching, though, watching like she knew what was going to happen.
Moto asked Elrahet, “How did he die?”
Elrahet pointed to the boy’s neck and said, “Bruises.”
“He was choked?”
She nodded. 
Seb stepped over and knelt next to the boy’s head. There was a story written on the boy’s face that Seb couldn’t read. There simply weren’t enough clues. His lips were ashen and cracked, but overall he didn’t look water-starved. His skin looked like it had never seen a sun-blister. His dark brown eyes bore that calm expression of death, serene, the kind of rested ease that Seb desperately wanted but wasn’t willing to go that far to get. 
“Wish I could figure what he’s doin’ here,” Seb said. 
“His body doesn’t look too spoiled,” said Moto. “Elrahet could always try and bring him back. Then he could tell us himself what he’s doing out here.”
Seb looked to Elrahet with eager eyes; watching the old witch work magic on a spark was first and foremost amongst his desires. But the suggestion sent Elrahet sneering all the deeper. “Do it yourself,” she said, lacing her words with derision.
Moto smirked. “Yeah, Seb, do it yourself. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be bagging a Mazyd lord.”
“If this don’t work out, an’ Ayram finds out there’s a dead body up here that you didn’t let him know about, then I’m blamin’ you. It’ll be your fault. Your fault.”
“Yes, that’s how responsibility works. Now, those wagons will be here before long, so do whatever it is you need to do and get back down there.”
Moto then pinched a flat stone finger whistle in between his lips and whistled the song of the Jek Tresset to let the rest of the Ayramun below know that they needed to gather themselves for the ambush. He stabbed and fluttered the high notes to encourage haste. Twittered replies to sprang up from the hills below, and then, without so much as a parting nod, he set off down the path that led down into that maze of boulders and valleys.
Elrahet was keen to be leaving too. She stood up and shuffled down the path after Moto, though she wasn’t headed down into the hills. She was headed to her witchy little cave to conjure a blanket of fog the likes of which the Junei hills hadn’t seen for an age—a nice impenetrable fog to lay cover for the ambush. Damn it all if Seb wasn’t going to follow her and watch how she did it.
He had to keep his distance though. Following Elrahet, he’d learned, was difficult. She was old but her ears and eyes were sharp. He had to be completely out of sight, and far enough out of sound that a crunch of pebbles underfoot wouldn’t give him away. It wouldn’t have been possible to follow her at all if he didn’t already know where she was going. The night before, he’d searched around for her cave and had found it. It was a thin crack in the base of a giant sloping slab of granite that constituted the greater part of a mountain peak. It was a little bit of a climb to get to it, and Seb wanted desperately to see how the old witch managed it, but that’d be too risky. He had to wait, and when he felt like he waited long enough, he ventured after her.
When he made it to the cave crack, he could hear Elrahet’s faint mumblings echoing out. He shuffled inside and saw, illuminated by a shaft of light, old Elrahet squatting over the corpse of a sizable black-backed lizard. 
The beast was belly up, and Elrahet’s fingers were already knuckle deep in its guts. Her arm twisted and twirled and her lips whispered incantations as her upturned eyes searched the blue sliver of midday sky that peeked through the crack in the rock above.
Then she turned and set her old blue eyes on him.
He stumbled backwards in fright and bumped his head on a rock and howled in pain.
“Damn!”
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, then she set her eyes back on the sky, and put her hand to work again in the lizard’s corpse.
She lowered her voice to whisper
Seb strained to hear the garbled words.
“Em bestet buguul.”
When the words were ___ and gone, she looked down at her handiwork and said, “Em bestet shemuul.” 
She pushed down hard with her palm to squeeze the last meal out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Shefre gor, amkukre dor.” 
Her knotted fingers kneaded the intestines. 
“Shefre gor, zomgaor.”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up into the air.
“We would be dust without it.” 
She dropped the entrails back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
Seb waited with bated breath for a spark, or effervescent swirl of glowing smoke, or anything, but nothing happened.
Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s white belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, and then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin. The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Its gummy tongue popped out of it’s shovel mouth. Right when Seb supposed that the thing had come back to life, it went limp again. Elrahet pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh.
“It is possible,” she said in a quiet whisper loud enough for Seb to hear, “that the beast is infertile.”
Seb ventured over. It seemed she was talking to him. There was no one else.
“This won’t work?” he asked as he knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Seb poked the lizard’s corpse with an adventurous finger. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines inside seemed to writhe and pulse like a knotted mass of worms.
“Worth a try,” he said.
Elrahet hissed at his dubiety, then said, “I need a fertile stomach.”
She was looking at Seb’s stomach.
“Fresh blood from a fertile stomach,” she said.
Seb’s skin went cold at the insinuation.
“How about the dead boy? Maybe that’s why we found him. Solraheen dropped him there for this purpose.”
“You are also here,” she said. “You are right here in my cave during my time of my need. Did Solraheen not also provide you to me without my seeking?”
“My blood’s no good.”
“Quit your bellyaching and give me your arm.”
“My arm?”
“The arm.”
“Thought you were gonna cut out my stomach. How much blood do you need?”
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given, least of all for magic. There’s no telling what a witch might do with it. But this was a golden chance to get in with the old woman and he had to take it. He studied her countenance to gauge her sincerity. Even in direct light, the difference between Elrahet’s smile and her frown was almost imperceptible under her sneer. It was common belief amongst the Ayramun that Elrahet never smiled at all, but Seb knew that wasn’t true. He’d seen her smile. He knew what it looked like. She wasn’t smiling now. 
“Your arm,” she said.
Seb rolled up his sleeve and extended his arm. Elrahet grabbed his wrist and Seb squeamed because her whole arm was still dripping from lizard blood. He also didn’t care for the way she seemed to relish the sight of the his veins bulging away under his brown skin.
Seb thought his blood was potent. He thought she’d only need a prick. She was only going for a fog after all, not a mountain storm. In truth he didn’t have the slightest idea about how this all worked, but if it took more than prick of human blood for a fog, then what would it take for a mountain storm?
He shuddered at the thought. Elrahet felt this shudder in her fingers, and when she felt it, she smiled. It caught Seb off-guard for it was more than a crick in the corner of the lip, it was a full-on, nearly toothless grin.
Seb asked again, this time with more than a hint of unease, “How much do you need?” 
Elrahet’s smile faded and that mess of aged lines settled back into that familiar sneer. She pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from out of the shadows beside her and laid them between herself and Seb. Then she unsheathed a long, thin knife from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise along Seb’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said, without affectation.
“Same.” 
Elrahet savored the returned courtesy, then pricked her dagger’s tip into his flesh and flicked her wrist with expert care to open the vein. Seb remained stoic through the sting but he watched with grave concern as blood streamed out of the wound and ran around his wrist and over Elrahet’s knuckles as it flowed steadily down into the bowl.
After what seemed an eternity, he jerked his arm free. 
“That’s it,” he said firmly, and he held his hand up and pinched the wound closed with his thumb.
“Your gift is humbling,” said Elrahet, “Yet the bowl is but half-full.”
“That should be enough.”
“Is it?”
“I’ve heard it said that a poor witch blames her tools.”
Elrahet scowled. “Who told you that?” she asked.
“You’re not the only witch I’ve known.”
Elrahet grumbled like dog about to bite. 
Seb backed away.
When next she spoke her throat was full of ___. 
“Think better of where you sit on the scales of the Ayram’s mercy. I could have your stomach for a bag.”
She tossed the scrap of linen at Seb’s face and shooed him out.
Seb cursed himself, because not only did he spoil whatever goodwill he’d just earned, he’d let her prick his right wrist, his pulling wrist. Every pull of the bowstring would bring a twinge of pain.

As Seb left, he snuck a look back and saw Elrahet flicking his blood into the lizard’s open belly.

That was the conceit. No progress but continuity.

The past is hardly dead, it calls out, demanding redress. It exists in the presnt as demand. It pulses, turningn always towards its own redemption.

The struggle in which benjamin understood himself to be engaged was hence for the past sa well as the future, for all those who had been displaced and reased as well as those presently under threat of erasure. It was a battle, defined in terms at once spiritual and political, over history, that it not be conceived via the self-flattering deceits of the victors as a ‘triumphal procession in which the presnt rulers step over those who are lying prostrate,” in which they succeed at disguising their atrocities as the grand achievements of civiliaztion on the march. “Only that historian will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins,” wrote benjamin.

Note: Don’t like the narration.
E.g.
Most people, apparently, didn’t want to go out glued to the monitor, with sticky hands and their shorts around their knees. Which is comforting, I guess.

            <Text>Invincible dread. That’s a twist on a catholic term of art: Invinicble ignorance. Is what they use to console mothers about the souls of dead babies. Such children, lacking speech, are said to be invincibly ignorant of the message of Christ.
Since catholicism became the of medieval europe, the term was also derived just war theory. Only one side of a war could be said to be waging a just war. But when both sides present arguments which supports their cause, the church would find itself in a sitcky situatuation, they were invincibly ignorant of the causes, of who truly had the side of justice.
Its a kind of term - maybe bring into this computational irreducibility. Impossibilty of truly knowing. This leads, I think, to state of Invincible Dread.
This book, Invincible dread, has nothing to do Christ, or computers, or. It is set in a fantasy world, akin to ancient mesopotamia, Rome, Egypt. But even then, the people of this place suffer from the same doubts.

Its a sprawling fantasy novel. There’s too much in it to sumrise with any certainty. with terrifying beasts, blah blah blah, and cannibals. The best answer to what is it about? It’s about Invincible Dread.</Text>

            <Title>Christain persecution</Title>
            <Text>https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51491/51491-h/51491-h.htm#sect_22

 This concession did not materially help Christianity after it had ceased, in the time of Nero, to be regularly confounded by the Roman authorities with Judaism, as had been the case in the time of Claudius, and Judaism, after the destruction of Jerusalem, had been sharply distinguished from it. It publicly proclaimed its intention to completely dislodge all other religions, and the rapidity with which it spread showed how energetically its intentions were carried out. The close fellowship and brotherliness that prevailed among Christians, as well as their exclusive, and during times of persecution even secret assemblies, aroused the suspicion that they had political tendencies. Their withdrawal from civil and military services on account of the pagan ceremonies connected with them, especially their refusal to burn incense before the statues of the emperor, also the steadfastness of their faith, which was proof against all violence and persuasion alike, their retiredness from the world, etc., were regarded as evidence of their indifference or hostility to the general well-being of the state, as invincible stiff-neckedness, as contumacy, sedition, and high treason. The heathen populace saw in the Christians the sacrilegious enemies and despisers of their gods; and the Christian religion, which was without temples, altars and sacrifices, seemed to them pure Atheism. The most horrible calumnies, that in their assemblies (Agapæ) the vilest immoralities were practised (Concubitus Œdipodei), children slain and human flesh eaten (Epulæ Thyesteæ, comp. § 36, 5), were readily believed. All public misfortunes were thus attributed to the wrath of the gods against the Christians, who treated them with contempt. Non pluit Deus, duc ad Christianos! The heathen priests also, the temple servants and the image makers were always ready in their own common interests to stir up the suspicions of the people. Under such circumstances it is not to be wondered at that the fire of persecution on the part of the heathen people and the heathen state continued to rage for centuries. 


The first persecution of the Christians proceeding from a Roman ruler which was directed against the Christians as such, was carried out by the Emperor Nero (A.D. 54-68) in the year 64, in consequence of a nine days’ conflagration in Rome, the origin of which was commonly ascribed by the people to the Emperor himself. Nero, however, laid the blame upon the hated Christians, and perpetrated upon them the most ingeniously devised cruelties. Sewn up in skins of wild animals they were cast out to be devoured of dogs; others were crucified, or wrapt in tow and besmeared with pitch, they were fixed upon sharp spikes in the imperial gardens where the people gathered to behold gorgeous spectacles, and set on fire to lighten up the night (Tac., Ann., xv. 44). After the death of Nero the legend spread among the Christians, that he was not dead but had withdrawn beyond the Euphrates, soon to return as Antichrist. Nero’s persecution seems to have been limited to Rome, and to have ended with his death 


Justin martyr Moved by the aged man's argument, Justin renounced both his former religious faith and his philosophical background, choosing instead to re-dedicate his life to the service of the Divine. His newfound convictions were only bolstered by the ascetic lives of the early Christians and the heroic example of the martyrs, whose piety convinced him of the moral and spiritual superiority of Christian doctrine. As a result, he thenceforth decided that the only option for him was to travel throughout the land, spreading the knowledge of Christianity as the &quot;true philosophy.&quot; His conversion is commonly assumed to have taken place at Ephesus[18][19] though it may have occurred anywhere on the road from Syria Palestina to Rome.[20] 

 persecutions again took a new turn under Marcus Aurelius (A.D. 161-180) who was, both as a man and a ruler, one of the noblest figures of antiquity. In the pride of his stoical wisdom, however, despising utterly the enthusiasm of the Christians, he not only allowed free scope to the popular hatred, but also introduced the system of espionage, giving to informers the confiscated property of the Christians, and even permitting the use of torture, in order to compel them to recant, and thus gave occasion to unexampled triumphs of Christian heroism. At Rome, the noble Apologist Justin Martyr, denounced by his opponent the philosopher Crescens, after cruel and bloody scourging, died under the executioner’s axe about A.D. 165 (§ 30, 9).―In regard to a very severe persecution endured by the church of Smyrna, we possess an original report of it sent from that church to one closely related to it, embellished with legendary details or interpolated, which Eusebius has incorporated in his Church History. The substance of it is a description of the glorious martyr death of their aged bishop Polycarp  

and while rejoicing in the midst of the flames, received the crown of martyrdom

            <Text>“What is it’s name?”
“I do not know.”

Mandri talking with Seculla - 

They’re up looking at the stars.
Pyetle is like, the void is beautiful.
Thats not the void.
What are you talking about. That empty blackness between the stars.


This god underground:
Pyetle pauses in the tunnel. Sees it opens into a larger room. Tries to see through the darkness. Ominous feeling in his gut.
Voice in the darkness. Seething through the air. As if the very air was resisting the voice.
- You’ve been outside my door before, haven’t you? With Ayram.
Freezes Pyetle.
 - Come on. Let me get a look at you.
Pyetle is hesitant. Doesn’t know what to do.
- I would appreciate the company. Haven’t talked to anyone but Ayram for a millenia.
- How about you come out of the darkness?
- If I could, if I could… Unfortunately, I’m unable to move. So come closer. I haven’t seen a kind face since… well that’s not true. I saw the little girl. Saw her the same day I smelled you. 
- Pyetle waved the torch to try to catch a glimpse of whatever was there.
- Come closer. Please, come closer.
Pyetle decided to do it. Takes a step.
The first thing the ligt touched was tip of horn. Twirled black like licorice. Then there was another broken in half. A head as tall as Pyetle’s entire body. Neck receded into the rock.  At first Pyetle thought the head was part of it, but the rock was cracked, and the head stuck inside. Something of the creatures shoulders could be seen. This thing was stuck - and judging by the __, it had been stuck for quite a long time. Vile looking creature.
Pyetle stunned. Stumbles backwards. Turns to open the door.
Wait! Please! I know how I look to you, but please. 
What are you?	Oh, same as you. Just a lost soul gotten stuck in a place where he shouldn’t be.
Pyetle stunned. Kept waving the torch.
I am called Molgaheed.
Molgaheed?





Is Ayram a demon?
Ayram? a demon? No. He is the First Man.  Surprised you had to ask. 
Silence. Demon senses hesitancy and confusioin
Tell me child, how was the world created?
I don’t know.
What do people say? Teach? They must teach something. Who? What? How? Why?
It is said that Sol, desiring worship, created the world so that we -
Sol!?
Pyetle nodded.
Maniacal laughter of a joke not heard in a million years.

The First Man. He’s a splinter wedged up in reality’s door. He keeps it from closing so that the rest of humanity can seep through. 

You see, you humans aren’t meant to be. Ever wonder why you’re the only thinking creatures? There’s a leak in the oversoul and Ayram’s the one whose keeping it open.


You’re evil.
Evil!? Evil!? What a simple mind, to see something you don’t understand and call it evil. Evil is for the folk who can’t put things togheter, for the folk who can’t accept the truth. Evil is for those who do evil.

The universe is a causal chain. There are other causal chains which are disconnected. Other universes. Other things, really. The past, present and future are linked. Time is a kind of illusion becuase they all exist simultaneously. It’s like this line in the clay. We are here, but this point in the past, and this point in the future are also there. 
The universe is attractive. Forces desire to shape it like clay in the potter’s hands. But if you touch the causal link, if you try to mold it, you become part of the link yourself. You become part of the universe. I touched it. I reached out of the primal void and touched it. I touched it and became manifest.
Depending on *where* you touch it, you manifest in different ways. 

“No. The Void…  it is a difficult thing to imagine because it is not merely‘empty blackness’. The word‘empty’ suggests space, form, and dimension. ‘Blackness’ suggests color, surface, and light. But the Void has none of these things. It’s not something you can see, or even notice. It’s not, ‘where the stars aren’t’, because it has no position. It’s got no properties at all save one: things can come out of it.”
“But if things can come out of it, then it’s got to have -“
“Shut up Pyetle.”
“Are you not familiar with the true story of creation?” Pella asked.
“Not as you would tell it,” Pyetle said.
“Well, the Void is the place - I shouldn’t say ‘the place’. I’ll just say, things come out of the Void. Leave it at that. What’s important is that the grandest of things which came was the Will of Being.”
“This I’ve heard,” Pyetle said.
“It oozed into existence like a heavy smoke,” Pella said. “It seeped through the tight gaps at the edges of reality’s seal. Eons passed and it coalesced into a fertile cloud. Think of it as a ‘cloud of potentiality’.”
“Yes. And then Sol came along and used it to create Life.”
“No, no, no, no. No. There are no Gods yet. There is only this ‘cloud of potentiality’. What we call the Essence of Will. But that’s not the only thing which came from the void. There are other voidclouds. Things like Chaos, Harmony, Despair. How they can sustain themselves without the Will of Being, thats a matter for philosophers. But when these voidclouds mingle with the stuff of Will , thats when things like you and me come into being. Everything tangible is a unique mixture of different quantities of voidcloud. Gods are no different. Sol included. He’s just made of denser stuff.”
“I thought Sol created everything.”
“Sure, that’s what the Empire teaches, but their priests know the truth. Really. I can tell you for a fact that they learn it even the first few years of training. That Sol and humankind are brothers. But it’s an esoteric story and they dont tell it fo political reasons.”
“Political reasons?” Pyetle said doubtful.
“Politcal reasons,” Pella said as she showed him the scar which wrapped around her neck.

Seculla: Do you think he’s a god?
Who? Ayram?
Who else?
I can see why you’d wonder.  But no, I don’t think so.
It’s possible though, right?
Eh.
Why not?
Well if something came from the Void, and it mingled with the Will of Being in just the right way, then I guess it is possible. But primordial things manifest as mountains. Storms. I just don’t think a fleshy prison could contain anything like that. At least not without it being obvious.
You’ve seen the things Ayram can do.
When I say obvious, I mean things like… I don’t know. Like there’s old Jandri tales of a man with glowing eyes and skin shining as bright like fire. Ayram’s just tall. And serious.
But the things he can do.
Being a skilled fighter doesn’t make you a god, Seculla. With his frame, I’d be more inclined to believe he was divine if he couldn’t handle himself in a fight. Why are you wondering all this? Does it have to do with how he found you?




Pella explaining the truth about the gods
The Gods did not come first. Life came first. From life came the gods. But also Man and Woman. The gods are our brothers and sisters. Older brothers, sure. Some much, much younger. But there is no natural hierarchy to Life’s creation. The empire teaches as such only because the Gods demand it. The empire encourages their worship only because it ensures their own survival.

            <Title>Chapter 3 _  Mazyd Uro</Title>
            <Text>Chapter 3 : Mazyd Uro
  
______________


        The poet Mandrameen believed that the strength of nations comes from the people. Aristocrats strut around in parades and give gifts to each other and genuflect in scripted rituals designed to reinforce the pyramid of power, but it's all a sham. Every person is born the same, screaming and naked. A lucky few get called ‘prince’ or ‘princess’ and they’ll be swaddled in blue velvet and given a golden ball to play with; the narrative of their lives is crafted even as they sleep: “Doesn’t she look exactly like a little queen?”. The rest of the howling babes grow up into common folk. Their lot? Simply endure and obey. 
        “Power is a numbers game,” Mandrameen wrote. “There is only one crown, but there are a million hungry mouths.” Every so often a bloated king will set aside this wisdom, convinced of his own inflated worth. He’ll spit in the face of his subjects[a]. In turn his kingdom will set itself ablaze. 
Popular revolts aren’t always successful, but the rich and powerful won’t always escape with their heads. Even Jeket’s most ill-fated revolution - which succeeded only in beheading a nameless prince of a cadet branch of an ailing dynasty - was considered by the mob to be a success. The elites of the city rounded up over a thousand peasants and paupers and threw them into a bonfire out in the desert in a grand display of retribution - but the dying moments of the damned weren’t filled with agony. There was defiance and even joy in their voices as they shouted their anthems of victory over the roaring flames. For them it was enough to have killed just one of the bastards.
That kind of anger is born only from oppression. It’s visceral and consuming, and it is stronger than the will of any one person, no matter what kings, queens, and their sycophantic ilk tell themselves. 
The cynic Seculla disagreed with all this. She was an advisor to Saulistides, and so she had seen the view from commanding heights. From up there, looking down, one thing was clear: only leaders matter. 
Sure, Royalty needs the people and their energy to do anything, but the discontented mob is inevitable. When it isn’t at center stage being manipulated into action, the mob prowls at the margins of history’s pages, clamoring for aimless change.[b] By and large, she remarked, it’s movements are impotent. It is only when the people’s passions are channeled through a single person, a leader, that they accomplish anything of note.
She claimed that the mob is a sword, one that is naturally dull and harmless if it’s never picked up. Most generations are smart enough to leave it lying in the dirt. Some elites, lusting for power by any means, will threaten to use it against their rivals, but they rarely ever actually wield it, because they know the stupidity that they’re dealing with is insatiable. It doesn’t take a close reading of Solean scripture to know that the ambition of even the poorest is a hydra, and that once one demand is severed, two more grow in its place.
The only people foolish enough to set the mob to task are - and for this she borrowed the Mandrameen’s own words - modest men with access to a higher truth. For her, this meant men who are so blinded by righteousness that they see chaos as more desirable to an imperfect union. They’d rather see the streets full of bodies and starving children than to live one more day under the yoke of their betters.
It is worth noting that since Seculla was a courtier of Saulistedes, it would have been prudent, to put it lightly, for her to espouse this view. Perhaps the rumors that she privately agreed with Mandrameen are true, but she served an Emperor, and Emperors believe that they are more important than the rest put together.
Saulistedes famously despised his own subjects. Insert story confirming this - mob murdered much of his family in a half accident as flames consumed his children.
Saulistides’ fury was tempered only by his religion. He was a Solean, and Soleans believe that all humans - regardless of rank - are plagued with the same crude impulses, the same stupidity and ignorance. As such, he knew that he was ultimately incapable of overcoming the infinite varieties of tragedy which might befall his nation. Even if he assumed that he was perfect in wisdom and judgment, the Gods had made him mortal, and his empire risked disintegrating as soon as he died. 
For years Saulistedes struggled with a sense of invincible dread. He desired perfection, certainty, security, and perfect love, but it was all impossible for there was no escaping his own flawed design. Even he, ruler of the largest empire known to man, was doomed by his creators to a life of futility.
In defiance, Saulistides commissioned his mages to construct Beings out of the Aetherium, just as the Gods had constructed Humans. Instead of slaves he intended to create leaders. Instead of a rigid and dysfunctional mind, there was to be an elegant and malleable structure, one which allowed the Being to fix itself, to change its very essence. 
Paragraph trying to explain the magnitude of this. The difference in kind of creatures. Bats can hunt in the dark. Eagles can spot a mouse in a field from a million miles up. 
Only such a creature could lead humans in their struggle against themselves, and more importantly, lead them in the only struggle worthy of the name ‘revolution’: a revolution against the Gods.
The mages guild he commissioned to build these creatures was called the Sacrosanct. Upon hearing the request, they labeled Saulistides a heretic. When they realized how much wealth was at stake and how long of a leash they would be given, they recanted that charge and began to work. When Salistides died, his daughter took on the project. Her son continued it on after her, and his son after him, and so on. Few of the Carcinain Emperors expected any  results, but it quickly became a sanctified tradition. 
Some 400 years after Saulistides’ reign, the Sacrosanct began to produce Beings that could talk, think, and move. Some 300 years more, and these Beings were refined enough in motor function that they could command cities and armies. 
These leaders of Humanity weren’t perfect, but they were approaching it.. The Sacrosanct named them Seilsi, which means ‘spark’ in the native tongue of the Carcinians. Common folk misinterpret this as a reference to the power that these Beings have to conjure electric flame through their hands, but really it is in reference to the Seilsi’s purpose, which is to organize the peoples of the world, the dry tinder, and to set light to it when the time is right.
The Sacrosanct kept secret just how many Seilsi there were at any given moment, but there weren’t many. It should have been a great surprise to Pyetle to find himself locked in a cave cell with one of them. He was completely oblivious to the magnitude of the moment.  
His only concern was his discomfort. His centuries-old cell had been hollowed out of the sandstone, but it retained a bulbous and natural shape, so there was no corner in which to tuck himself away. He was forced to sit right up close to this stranger, who was slumbering away in the dark. There was just enough light that Pyetle could make out that the man was almost nude was covered in dried blood. What’s more is that he was missing his hands, and that on the stubs of his forearms were bandages so caked with glistening blood and pus that they were leaking. The poor wretch just lay there in the cool darkness, beaten and bloody, looking so much like a tortured soul from hell. The stench was haunting. Pyetle hardly dared to breathe.
This was a regular outlaw, Pyetle assumed, a thief of thieves who was being punished for his crimes in brutal frontier fashion. Pyetle did sense an aura about him, but it was unnaturalness, not greatness. Each time he looked upon the near-corpse of a man he was filled with a strange sense of discordance. When he finally mustered the courage to place it, he found that he wasn’t sure if the man were a man at all;  his features seemed feminine, and his frame was lithe and skinny, and the cloth which wrapped his groin seemed wrapped so tight that it couldn’t possibly contain any private parts. If he wasn’t a woman, he must have been a young castrato - older than boy, but young. 
There was also the fact that he didn’t seem to have any hair. There was no scruff on his chest, and he wasn’t just bald, he had no eyebrows. Though it was too dark to really tell, he seemed to be missing even his eyelashes.
All in all, it disgusted Pyetle. So great was his revulsion that he shuddered and tucked in his feet when the young man’s body suddenly curled up in a violent coughing fit.
Blood and spittle flew, and when it was over, the poor wretch wiped his lips with the pitiful stump of his arm. Pyetle expected him to whimper or sob after such a brutal wracking, but the lad simply lay his head back down against the rock and sighed.
He was awake.
The hairs on Pyetle’s arms and legs pricked up when he noticed that the young man’s eyes were open, glinting in the darkness. They were searching him over, studying him. Pyetle returned a weak smile, but felt foolish when he realized that he was sitting in the shadow and the young man probably couldn’t see it. They were just sitting there, the two of them, staring at each other in an uneasy bond of silence.
Pyetle felt he should say something, but the young man spoke first.
“Are you one of my jailers?” he asked. His voice was quite soft and clear, nearly a woman’s voice. It put Pyetle off a little to hear such pleasant tones coming from someone in  such a wretched state, and so he took an odd beat to respond.
“No.” he said. “I’m Pyetle. I’m not in control here if that's what you want to know.”
“Well, Pyetle, my name is Mazyd.” The young man closed his eyes and sighed again, wincing in pain as he tried to find a more comfortable position.
But Pyetle was eager for conversation.
“Fine day, Isn’t it?” he asked.
Mazyd did not answer. Instead, he took a deep breath, sat upright, and [c]asked a question out of turn. 
“Why are you here?”
“Well…” Pyetle mumbled as he searched for a good answer. “I guess you could say I’m a new recruit.” 
At that the Mazyd laughed, or rather, he tried to laugh but he fell into a cough - this time when the blood and spittle came out it stained Pyetle’s toes.
“Pardon me. Sorry. I would cover my mouth with my hands but -” and he held his arms,“ I was recently robbed of them.”
“Well... I, uh…”
“It’s all good,” Mazyd said with a chuckle. “I don’t blame you for falling in with these demons. We all do what we must. But why are you in here with me, if you’re one of them?”
“I was told that they don’t trust me just yet. Don’t want me slinking around their hideaway.”
“They don’t trust you?”
        “I’ve only just joined.”
“Do you trust them?” Mazyd asked.
“No… Well... I suppose I do a little… Actually no, I don’t at all. I was just thinking that, you know, I must be trusting them a little to let them whisk me away and throw me in here, but then again, I don’t really care if I live or die, I don’t care what happens to me, so it’s not really a matter of trust.”
Again the young man’s eyes flashed over Pyetle, who cut nearly as pitiful a figure there in the damp dark. Pyetle was small, skinny and balding. Every part of him was disheveled. 
“You don’t care if you die?” the young man asked. 
“Not really, no.”
“Why not?”
“Well…” Pyetle paused to consider his lot. “Im old. Old enough. I’ve lost too much. Too much loss, too late in life. Mix in some betrayal.”
“I see.”
“I just don’t have the energy or will to start up again. There’s just not enough time left for me, so even if I wanted to go back to the grind and work my life back up, there wouldn’t be any time left to just enjoy it all. So, it’s just a good time to give up.”
“Yet you took up with thieves?”
Pyetle shrugged. “This wasn’t planned. I’m only here because of a strange coincidence.”
“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” Mazyd said.
Pyetle nodded in mock acceptance. “Yes, yes,” he said. “Everything happens through the will of the Gods.”
        “That’s not what I mean.”
“Oh?”
“Just because you can’t see the chain of consequence that leads to your misery, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t one.”
“Well it’s good that you feel that way.” Pyetle said. He was a little stunned that Mazyd could be so sure of himself, considering his state. “That’s really good,” he repeated. “Impressive, really. If I were in you I’d be cursing everything. Fate especially. ”
“No, this is my fault,” Mayzd said. “At least, I don’t think it defies imagination to say that somewhere along the way I made a few mistakes.” Mazyd said this with a great deal of levity, and it surprised Pyetle to see the glint of Mazyd’s white teeth. The bloody pulp of a man was actually smiling.
“I suppose you’re right,” Pyetle said, smiling in turn. “But it doesn’t matter. Let’s just say that I happened upon the most striking person I’ve ever met at a pivotal crossroad in my life. That’s why I’m here.”
“Who was this person?”
“The leader of this robber band. His name is Ayram. You can’t have missed him.”
The young man shook his head and said, “I’ve only heard voices.”
“Well, when you meet him you’ll know who he is.”
Mazyd grunted in a show of indifference and slumped down against the rock. 
“Do you owe this man a debt?” he asked.
Pyetle sat back and considered Mazyd’s question, as he hadn’t thought of it. Did he owe Aryam a debt? Ayram had saved him from Death, but that in itself didn’t bother him. Sure, it would have been cruel to die at Salavan’s hands, so he supposed he could thank Ayram for that - but a debt? Ayram was going to kill Salavan anyways. The whole thing was just a coincidence.
He didn’t spend too long thinking about it, because even if there was an honor debt to be paid, he no longer cared about honor. That was a game for people with something to lose.
“No, he’s just an interesting person,” Pyetle finally said. “He’s immense. It’s not just his size, it’s his presence. It’s exciting just to be around him.”
        “So you decided to float along in his wake?”
“Something like that.”
“Well…” Mazyd said, straightening his back to sit upright, so that he might treat with Pyetle more personably ,“It’s nice to meet you, Pyetle.” He stuck out his arm for a handshake, then looked down at his bloody stump, and laughed. Pyetle laughed along with him.
“How about an elbow?” Pyetle asked, and he stuck his out. Mazyd bumped it with his own, and smiled again.
“It seems like neither of us have any friends here,” Mazyd said, “and I’m in a pretty bad way. Pyetle, I need a friend right now, and you’re it. You don’t have a choice. I don’t care if you’re not interested, do what you want. I’m a little desperate. I just need the glimmer of hope that a friend can give - even if it's a one-way deal.”
“I’m not -”
        “No, no, no,” Mazyd interrupted. “ You just do whatever you want. Just know that from this point on, whatever trust you put in me, I’ll treasure it.”
        Pyetle shrugged his shoulders.
“You do what you want,” Mazyd repeated. “My life isn’t worth much at the moment. They’ll probably kill me before tomorrow. I just don’t want to die without a friend nearby.”  
Pyetle wasn’t sure how to handle this doomed man’s wish. If Pyetle were younger, he would have humored Mazyd out of pity, but time had squeezed the empathy out of him. Plus, he didn’t know why Mazyd was locked up, nor why Ayram had elected to chop off his hands. It could have been simple theft, but it could be something unforgivable - Mazyd could be the kind of person to set his hands on another man’s wife. 
“Why are you in here?” Pyetle asked.
Mazyd sighed. “I was marching along with my people towards Jeket when your people ambushed us in the Junei hills.”
“What were you doing out there?”
Pyetle’s question gave Mazyd pause. He began to scrutinize his new friend. “We were about the Emperor’s business,” he said.
“What?”
        “That surprises you?”
“Well, yes. I figured you to be a thief.”
“No.”
“So, what, you’re a soldier?”
“More or less.”
        “Why did they cut off your hands?”
“Because I’m a magus.”
“Really?” Pyetle said, his voice pitching in excitement. “Could you show me a little something?” he asked.
        Mazyd just held up his bandaged arms to remind Pyetle of his predicament.
“Right,” said Pyetle, disappointed as much as the absence of proof for Mazyd’s story. “Well Mazyd, you’re either a fantastic thief and liar, or you’ve got the worst lot of any person  I’ve ever met - well anyone that’s lived past twenty. How old are you?”
“One hundred and twenty two.”
“What?
“One hundred and -” But before Mayzd could repeat the number, he was interrupted by the echoes of feet slapping on the damp stone outside. Then keys scratched at the lock, and the door creaked open. Torchlight flooded into the cell, giving Pyetle a clean view of Mazyd. The shock of him was nearly blinding. He wasn’t just covered in blood. His body from his feet up to his neck were covered in intricate arrangement of symbols tattooed in black. It was the unmistakable markings of a Seilsi. 
Pyetle’s jaw fell open.
“Oi, Sandie! He’s awake!”
“Well, bring him out then.”
One of the two captors stepped into the cell. He was a scruffy looking man with a long nose. 
“Can you stand up?” he asked Mazyd. “I’d help but I don’t want to touch you, mate.”
The woman behind him chuckled.  “Oh, help him up Deedee. You twit.”
“I’ll do no such thing.”
Mazyd looked to Pyetle, but Pytle was still stunned by the sight of him, so  he put his feet under his butt and labored up to a standing position by using the wall behind him for support.
“What about you?” Deedee asked. “You’re alright, right? Name’s Pyetle, right?”
Hearing his name spoken aloud snapped Pyetle to attention. “Yes, that is my name,” he said. 
“We’re off to a bit of a meeting. You’re invited.”
Pyetle stood up and stretched his back, all the while gawking at Mazyd. He’d never dreamed he’d see a Seilsi this up close, or in this place of all places. He followed Mazyd and Deedee out of the cell and into the cave proper, where Sandie waited. She was holding the only torch, and it’s flickering light illuminated the narrow slip of rock under her feet. The rest of the ground fell into a large blue-green pool of mineral water. 
Pyetle wondered what part of the continent’s drainage system this could possibly be. He had never heard of such a cave in this part of the world. It’s walls were waxy and seemed to be frozen mid-melt. Glistening strands of hard seemed to drip from the ceiling like saliva on the roof of a lizard’s mouth. The water was alive. Shapes moved and little lights flashed in its depths. Deedee swept Pyetle along before he had time to worry.
They moved on into a tunnel that led up towards the surface. With each step the rock became dryer, and the going got steeper. Mazyd struggled along. He walked with his elbows tucked tight against his body, fearing to brush his arms against a stray shadow of a rock. It compromised his balance, and coupled with the recent loss of blood, he was sure to move slowly.
The others accomodated him. Mazyd cut such a tragic figure that, even though Deedee and Sandie despised him in principle, they couldn’t help but pity him. They weren’t cruel people, but this little march felt cruel.
Here and there they would pass a tunnels that spread off in odd directions, up and down, skewing this way that, leading off into some unknown abyss.
“What created this place?” Pyetle wondered aloud.
“Hell if I know,” Deedee said. “Ayram might.”
        “Ayram knows,” Sandie corrected, but she didn’t expound upon it. Pyetle didn’t feel like he was in any position to ask to do so.  
Eventually, they came out into a massive open-air pit cave. Pyetle’s eyes took time to adjust, for the circle of sky above was bright and blue, and the sun’s light angled down the colossal sandstone walls and fell upon the sand in a dusty, radiant glow. 
Twenty-five of Ayram’s band were in attendance. They were a motley crew of every race and color, and they congregated on the shadowed side of the pit across from where Pyetle stood. This wasn’t a living space, and so there weren’t many furnishings - just a few logs and makeshift chairs to sit on, as well as a few crude tents set up on the sunny-side of the pit. There wasn’t anything that couldn’t be packed away at a moment's notice. 
Pyetle spied a few others high up on the rim. They were supposed to be lookouts, but they were eager to be down with the others, eager to be part of the buzz of excitement that filled the pit. This excitement was contagious. It worked its way into Pyetle when he, Mazyd, Deedee and Sandie made their way out into the sunlight. 
All chatter ceased and all eyes turned to them. None seemed to care much for Pyetle, as Mazyd’s pale and bloody pulp captivated the crowd.
One of their number stood up, and like the shadow of a tree he towered over the others. He let loose a shrill whistle for attention. Everyone else promptly sat down. The giant then began walke to Pyetle and his company, out of the shadow and into the light, and Pyetle saw that it was Ayram. Who else.
 Pyetle looked at Mazyd who stood transfixed in Ayram’s gaze. He wondered.Then there came a tugging at Pyetle’s shirt. It was Deedee.
He was beckoning Pyetle to follow and whispered, “Come on!” 
Pyetle trailed him around the edge of the pit to join the others in the pit’s shadow. Ayram began to speak just as he sat down.
“Before we decide what to do with this prisoner -” Ayram slapped Mazyd on the back. The action nearly buckled Mazyd’s knees. He looked like a child next to Ayram. Everyone does. 
“Before we decide what to do about him, we need to address Papi and Colm. It’s come to my attention that some of you are blaming Elrahet for their deaths.” Ayram had his arm extended out, and his piercing blue eyes were scanning the crowd, as if to accuse them all, even the ones who dared listened to the gossip. “That stops now.” 
He let the finality of his words echo around the pit. Whatever ill-will his people bore towards his witch, it was now gone.  
“In case you aren’t aware,” he continued, “this man here is a Seilsi!”
He shoved Mazyd forward and down to the ground. 
A chorus of whispered mutterings broke out in the crowd. Not all had descended from the Empire or the Solean religion, but they had all by now heard the rumors about their prisoner, and this startling confirmation settled on them like a wet blanket. 
Pyetle was especially moved to see a Seilsi brought so low.
“For those of you who don’t know,” Ayram said, “this slight excuse for a man is one of the Empire’s most lauded generals and one of its most coveted weapons. He could have killed us all in heartbeat if Elrahet’s storm hadn’t raged.”
“Elrahet!” cheered one of the crowd, and the rest clapped in approval.
“We should also thank Pella for her quick decision to take this scoundrel’s hands.” Even as Ayram said it, the cheers and plaudits grew loud for Pella. Pyetle followed Deedee’s gaze and saw an old woman soaking it. She was smiling and waving as if all the others were her children.
“Many more than just Papi and Colm would have died if it weren’t for that bolt of fire from the sky,” Ayram declared. “If my command is not enough, and any of you still have something to settle about Papi and Colm, then it's me you need to see. There’s no room in this life for bitch talk and rabble rousers. You have a problem, come see me.” He slapped his great chest with his fist, daring them to actually do it. “ I’ll be fair for as long as you are honest.”
“Now,” he said, turning to the crumpled form of Mazyd.  He reached down with one hand, grabbed him by the neck, and pulled him up to his feet. “What are you doing in my desert?”
Mazyd stood there, his face drawn tight in pain, and did not answer. 
“Speak, man!” Ayram shouted. “Is the Empire so scared of my family that they’d send you to root us out?”
Mazyd looked up at Ayram and said in the most matter of fact tone imaginable, “I don’t even know who you are.”
        Ayram grinned beneath his beard and a wild look came into his eyes. “You know, I can tell when someone is lying.”
“All I know is that your name is Ayram.”
“And your what is your name, sir?” Ayram asked.
“Mazyd Uro.” 
“Pella! Is this the one who burned your family alive?”
Pella shouted her answer. “No! I’ve not heard that name.”
“Mazyd Uro…” Ayram repeated. “You were sent to hunt us, yes? A devious Imperial trap, no?”
“Have you not stopped to consider,” Mazyd said with frustration, “That you were the trap for me?”
“Aye, but I don’t think anyone would reasonably expect that such a small band of simple thieves could overcome a Seilsi mage. No one would send a wolf like you into a den of foxes and expect it to lose. Hah!”
“Yet here I am.”
“Here you are indeed. But why? This won’t be over until I get an answer. I can get Elrahet involved if you like. A little blood magic will tease it out of you. You’ve got enough of it left, no?”
Mazyd looked out at the faces of the crowd. He found Pyetle’s and smiled.
“I was looking for your hovel in the mountains,” he said.
“We have no such place.”
“The Jandrian tribes. The place they’ve all fled to. It's some ruin in the mountains.”
“Urgiz?”
“Yes, that’s what they call it.”
“And what do you care about that forsaken place?”
For the first time, Mayzed took Ayram eye to eye, and said, “I was tasked to deliver a sword to your king.” 
A stillness swept over the crowd. One of them stood and shouted, “He lies!&quot;
Another stood and tried to shout him down. “A Seilsi does not lie!” 
Mazyd looked out at Ayram’s followers to let them judge for themselves the earnest truth written on his face. 
“The light of the law is coming to you and your kin!” he shouted.
“You mean the light of War!” 
“Barbarians make war,” Mazyd spat. “The Empire makes peace!”
His words set the band of outlaws buzzing. Pyetle was pushed into the sand as others rushed over him, each shouting “Murderer!”, and “Demon!”. Deedee was enraptured. He stood next to Pyetle’s and shouted, “Genocidal Demon!” so many times and with so much gusto that he nearly fainted. 
Ayram himself was unmoved. He held out his hand, but when that didn’t work he let loose another shrill whistle. The outlaws settled back down.
“We did find a sword,” Ayram said. “We found seventy-seven of them!”
At that there was a great cheer. Mazyd rolled his eyes.
“But yes, we did find an unusual one, too. Pella, bring it here.”
Old Pella got up, walked to Ayram, and pulled from her bundle of robes a wooden sword. It was immaculately carved and polished to a sheen. The base of its blade and its guard was inlaid with gold, and its half-shell pommel was trimmed with jade stars. Burned into its comically dull edge were words in old Carcinain. They read, “This blade will do as well as any other.”
The message was clear: when the Empire comes knocking, you might as well defend yourself with a stick.
        The sight of the sword quieted what was left of the grumbling crowd. A few wept. They were outlaws and they killed, but what the Empire had done to them and their kind was another thing entirely. 
        “This man thought he could stroll into Urgiz and present this sword to Lindrimuud. So sure of his power, he thought he could stroll right out again, unmolested. Look at him now. Well I shall not be the one to stand in your way, Mazyd Uro. This sword belongs to Lindrimuud, and since the Emporer sent you, then you’ll be the one to bring it to him. But!” he said, and brought his face close to Mazyd’s. “You’ll not be walking out like you planned.”

            <Title>Exchange</Title>
            <Text>The first floor of the tower was nearly as dark as a cave, composed of a single hallway running north to south, and in the middle of this hall, on either side, were sets of wide oaken double doors that opened up into large dust-strewn storage rooms that nothing in them but stone pillars. At the end of the hall was a staircase.
The second floor was a single room, pillars included, and four paces around the circumference, there was a narrow window. Scant rays of light filtered in through the slits in the eastern side, while the views through the windows to the west were obstructed by the forms of Ayramun jostling to get a better look at the Hrkan horse and rider as they trotted towards their leader on the sand below. 
Mandri watched all this from the staircase. Once he was ready, he ducked down into the dark of the first floor to dab one meager droplet of juice from the God’s Eye burgeon onto his tongue. No more than that; the idea was to escape, not end up catatonic like before. He then plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a tightly rolled scrap of woolen rag, and he stuffed the thing in his pocket for later. If he rationed it carefully, he could make it last a week. Then, maybe, he could steal another.
He sat down on the fourth stair-step and waited there in the dark for the burgeon-sight to take hold. He knew it wouldn’t take long.
Purl got to him first.
“Where’s Mandri?”, she asked from above.
Mandri couldn’t hide his disappointment when he said, “I’m here! I’m here.”
Not wanting to seem , he stood up, and climbed up rest of the stairs to be with the others.
Out of the four Ayramun, Purl was the only one who wasn’t glued to the western window. She was sitting against the eastern wall, still strapped into her pack. 
“Don’t take it off,” Purl said to him when she noticed he was wanting to be rid of his own pack. 
“Why not?”
“We need to be ready to run.
“It only takes a second to put it on.”
“Leave it on.”
“Fine,” said Mandri, and he plopped himself down right next Purl, pack and all.
He leaned into her and said, “Do you have any idea how we’re supposed to get out of this?”
“Ayram has a plan.”
“Didn’t seem like it to me. His words, if I recall, were, ‘I’ll figure it out’.”
“When he says that it’s because he knows we won’t like the plan.”
“Seems like he’s winging it to me.”
Mandri 
“Why are you sweating?”
“I’m stressed. And my pack is heavy.”
“But it’s cold in here.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t know.”
He wasn’t about to say that burgeons make his heart beat faster, and that gets him worried and sweating about it even though it happens every time.
“Are you that sad about Obo?”, Purl asked.
“I’m not sad, I’m… I don’t know how to describe it.”
“The first time I saw Obo, I watched him kill thirty Ayramun, and if you asked me then if it was possible that I could feel anything but anger about him, I would have smacked you in the face for suggesting it.”
“But you can’t bring yourself to blame him, can you?”
“It’s infuriating.”
Mandri sank lower into his pack, which was quite comfy with all the new additions.
“The thing that gets me is that I feel guilty,” he said. “There’s nothing I could have done for him, so why do I feel guilty?”

Mandri sighed and looked up at the ceiling. He said, “Life is horrible. I can’t think of one person who isn’t miserable.”
“God, you’re so dumb.”
“Who do you think has it good?”
“Most people who aren’t us.”
“The most miserable sap I've ever seen was a Hrkan prince. I looked into his eyes and it was like he was already old, and it wasn't a ‘just-happy-to-be-here’ old, it was that joyless, ‘I-wish-I-could-be-you’ old.”
“I bet those pilgrims on those poles would prefer to be a Hrkan Prince.”
“Okay, yes, there’s levels to misery, but that doesn’t change the fact that everyone is some shade of miserable.”
“No, you are miserable, and so you think everyone else is.&quot;
&quot;Name me one person who isn’t some shade of miserable.”
“Me.”
“You can lie all you want, but that doesn’t change the facts.”
“I get sad and I get over it. Miserable people don’t get over it.”
“Look me in the eyes and tell me you’ve gotten over losing your hand for no fucking good reason.”
Purl’s face scrunched up in revulsion, as if Mandri had just threatened to reach down and rip the scab off her wrist.
“You’re such a fucking prick,” she said.
“Why? Because I’m right?”
Purl fixed Mandri in her gaze and tried to tell him, with every ounce of persuasive power in her soft brown skin, and her freckled , that he was completely missing the point. It was an expression that Mandri had seen a thousand times on a hundred different faces and somehow he’d yet to ascertain its meaning. To him it meant the other person had run of out of arguments and so he’d won.
“How about Obo, then?”
That was not something he’d considered.
“What about him?”
“He’s got every right to be as miserable as you, but he’s not.”
Mandri sat back and considered the truth of it.
“Oh shit.”
She was right. Well, she wasn’t right, because Obo wasn’t human and so he didn’t count. Still, it was a kind of revelation: Obo was the one thinking creature in this entire goddamn world who wasn’t miserable. Obo was capable of getting over the wrongs done to him. In this respect, he was like a dog, he had that forgive and forget. This realization triggered another: the reason, and why the dog worshipers of Solk had good reasons to worshiped dogs.
“Ah, fuck.”
That droplet from the God’s Eye burgeon wasn’t doing shit. It wasn’t expanding the ceiling into infinity, it wasn’t swirling the colors of the floor, and it wasn’t tamping down on the sadness that was of Obo’s impending doom.
Mandri briefly considered gulping down the rest of the burgeon juice, then decided against it when his heart was strafed by the shame of not bearing witness to Obo’s final moments. If he didn’t watch, then no one who cared would, and a memory such as this should not be the sole property of people who didn’t understand what was happening.
So he shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his heavy pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.
“Going to watch?”, Purl asked.
“Might as well.”
He walked over to the western window where Moto, Moteah, and Seb were huddled. The window seemed to glow. At first, there wasn’t room enough for him between Moto and Moteah’s excited elbows, then Moto decided that these moments would be better spent doing something else, so he left and Mandri was able to squeeze himself into the picture before Seb and Moteah could close ranks.
When Mandri looked down upon the scene, his vision was flooded with the light of revelation.
This was not normal burgeonsight. There were no sparkling lights or glistening surfaces. What he saw was the golden light of unveiled purpose shining out from under the skin of every surface. Ayram, Elrahet, the scribe, the horse, the Riga, Obo lying in the dirt, the valley mouth and the desert beyond it, the tower’s shadow ascribing the position of the sun, the tower itself, the stone of the window-sill under Mandri’s fingers, every element here had weaved it’s own trail throughout history and was bristling with the flighty fibers of purpose, and these fibers were hereby joined in Mandrameen’s eye, for his sight was the spindle that bound them together into a thread that wound back out into the world, tied it tight, and wound back onto his eye’s spindle, a continuous threading and re-threading of purpose.
As a composition the scene was static, figures arranged in a triangular frame; Ayram and Elrahet anchoring bottom corners, the scribe on his white horse above them, with Obo on the ground bridging the gap between. This was not mere symbolism - symbolism is what artists do when they violate the veil of purpose, no, the scribe, that dark Hrkan man, he did not represent Hrkan power advantaged on a proud steed, he was that power, and in his lap was the Riga child, the very embodiment of Hrk’s assault on the sanctity of creation. Ayram was not a symbol of the outland peoples, he was their paragon, and sidling up next to him was Elrahet, old desert ways made manifest and given agency. In between these two parties was Mazyd Obo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of humanity in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred, cowering, and naked. The others looked past him as if he wasn’t there.
Mandri lamented the lack of materials. If he’d only had a stick of charcoal he could start sketching on the smooth tower stone right then and there. The urge to do so was overwhelming. The scene was pleading with him to be given its own sacred body, that it might move about the world and inject its purpose into every future moment. But as vivid as this burgeonsight was, Mandri was present enough to know that it would all be gone as fast as it had come. If he didn’t sketch it out now, as he saw it, details would be forgotten. One night’s sleep and they’d be lost forever.
He was forced instead imprint the scene upon his mind as best he could using the mnemonic of repetition. He kept his eye jumping from detail to detail and back again, and then again, and again, and again, and at each stop he beheld the object, an act which went beyond mere noticing, this was the artist's noticing, the lover's noticing, the thief’s noticing, covetous noticing, noticing to remember. Beholding not a lossless art, but what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later.
The details get run through like a shopping list.
The arc of the tower’s shadow splitting the scene in half. 
The precise angle and rate of change as the shadow’s curve swerved from the upper left to the bottom right.
The coolness of color inside that shadow and its subtle, sumptuous greys.
The size disparity between Ayram and Elrahet. Both dark and shrouded in that shadow. Wind flicking Ayram’s long black locks. Wind tickling the hem of Elrahet’s desert-bitten robe.
The Hrkan horse, Gods, what a specimen. White as chalk. Brushed muscles glistening in the light of the sun. Neck as wide as Ayram’s shoulders. Eyes wide as . A . An impatient, braided tail.
Sitting in the saddle was the Hrkan scribe, dark skin reddened and glistening with kell oil. The trail of his blue robe, filigreed with golden leaves, his right arm cradling the black-bundled Riga. 
Obo on the ground. Pale. Fly-swatted. Staring at the sky. So perfect was the staging that the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across his stomach. 
The rest of the environment, the tower bricks, the colors of the rock and sand and their arrangement, these were static things and could be ignored because they could be revisited. It was an injustice, abstracting them out as if they weren't contributing to the moment’s purpose, but it was more than he could manage.
He ran through the details again. 
The arc of the tower’s shadow - that hadn't changed.
Ayram and Elrahet still stood resolute.
The horse hadn’t even shifted it’s weight.
Mandri licked his lips. His mouth was dry. Burgeons have a way of doing that.
Ah, yes, the white line of Hrkan soldiers looming in the distance. It would take a large canvas to accommodate them. A lot of paint.
A nervous twinge at the prospect of having to fill up that large a frame.
The Hrkan scribe was still cradling the Riga. Neither had moved.
No one was speaking. It was as if Solraheen had frozen the scene for Mandri’s benefit. All the actors were suspended in time by the golden light of purpose. 
And that light was there, too.
But how to paint it?
It wasn’t as simple as a shaft of light or an ephemeral back-light glow that smothers a form or catches it rim, it was more like a pulsing mist, and yet not like a mist at all. He could, perhaps, wait for the paint to dry and design some new oil wash to lighten aspects the image. Judiciously applied, it could, perhaps, mimic…
That wouldn’t work at all. And he would have to worry about that later. There might be other details that need accounting.
The shape of the negative space between Ayram’s legs, a balanced triangle, his boots digging into the dirt.
Another triangle in Ayram’s broad back bristling with energy. 
All of him tethered to his great spud bar, which was whole head and a half taller than Ayram himself.
Mandri winced as he studied the bar, for the dark tip of it formed an unsightly, image-flattening tangent with the horse’s dark leather stirrup, such that the stirrup and accompanying harness seemed to sprout out from the bar. This element would need to be fixed. Mandri could adjust the angle of the bar in Ayram’s hand so that it didn’t intersect with the stirrup at all.
Would that be sacrilegious?
The scene would work better if the spud bar was in the other hand.
It would take nothing away from the sheer weight of the man. Might even add to it.
What else?
There was infinite.
There was a vulture up in the sky. Mandri wished there wasn’t one, because a vulture circling the scene was almost too on the nose. People might start to think that this was all his own doing. Maybe he should remove the vulture.
Ech.
That would be a step too far. 
He would have to include the vulture.
And the vulture’s faint screech? More to the point, how should he approach the subject of sound? Sound was critical to everything. 
The wind whistling through the rocks.
The sparkling swish of wind whipped sand.
The thupping of leather-bound feet sprinting along a stone floor.
The sound of Purl’s voice yelling.
Yelling what?
Oh, it was his name.
“MANDRI!”
He turned around.
Suddenly, Moteah and Seb were no longer squeezing his shoulders, in fact, they weren’t even in the room. Gone, too, was the light of purpose that flooded his vision - there was only the stark, cold, dim confines of the tower’s second level, deserted save for Purl who stood in the stairwell across the room. Her face was alight with wide-eyed urgency. “Come on!”, she shouted, and then she ducked away down the stairs.
Mandri blinked in confusion. There was no need for such uptightness.
He spun back around so that he could narrate for Purl the tedium of the scene below, but when he did he was stunned to see that his pyramidal frame was empty. No one was there, nothing was there, nothing but signs of a scuffle in the dirt.
A track of hoof prints led out east into the sand, and following it, Mandri found, some thirty yards away, the Hrkan scribe. He was laying flat on his stomach. His left hand grasped his Hrkan horn, and his right grasped his sword. His face was mushed into a thickening pool of his own blood.
From there, the hoof-prints fled out at an oblique southward angle. Behind a puff of kicked-up dust, Mandri could see the white Hrkan horse charging hard into the emptiness of the desert under the whip of it’s own fright. There, too, at the edge of the valley mouth, was the long white line of Hrkan soldiers, three ranks deep, double marching towards the tower. 
“Well this is some shit,” Mandri muttered.
He turned around to ask for an explanation, but of course, Purl was already gone.
His jaw clenched up tight, and he crossed the room as quick as his feet could carry him. Each step was chore, for his limbs were thick with lethargic acids left by the passing of the God’s Eye burgeon. His pack seemed heavier than it had ever been.
He staggered down the stairs and into the darkness of the first floor hallway. Here, the true bewilderment set in. His stomach turned. His chest heaved and his throat made to vomit… only a dry wretch and a stray string of spittle came out. He thanked Solraheen for the closeness of the cold stone walls, else he might not have managed to stumble out into the tower’s tunnel.
The Light of Purpose, is that what he had seen? Or was it a mere trick of the burgeon? His mind fumbled around for understanding and could find only the memory of it, the kind of thing that makes a man mad if he looks too longingly at it.
“What are you doing!?”, Purl shouted.
She had been waiting for him in the courtyard. She wasn’t the only one. All those tortured souls were still there. In them, Mandri could see purpose, no burgeons needed. Not light of purpose, the shadow of it. 
“Where’s Obo?” Mandri asked Purl.
“Didn’t you see?”
“No... I couldn’t.”
Purl’s lips spread into a thin smile. “Ayram did it!” she said. “We can lose the Hrks for good!” 
Mandri followed her through the courtyard and fixed his eyes on the wheel-rutted path, thinking as best he could about his next step instead of the horror of the scene around him.
At length, they passed into the shadow of that god-stricken cleft of earth which men call the Goree Pass.</Text>

Consume human flesh.

Things outside of society.
Push you beyond the idea of good/bad/ugly/beautiful

When they find temselves near death aghoris deliberately leave their bodies and enter the bodies of corpses, taking them over and making them live for as long as they please, until they decide to change bodies again.
Most dead personalities cannot move about so freely on their own, and some tantrics worship in graveyards and charnelgrounds simply to catch hold of human spirits and force them to perform work. THe most puissant are deities, personifications of cosmic forces. The ultimate siddhi is control of adya, the personification of the entire cosmos.
Essential to the production of any siddhi are mantr, yantra, and tantra. Mantra is the energy which moves your vehicle (the yantra) according to the road map (tantra). 

A true tantric regards every human being as already dead since the fact of birth makes death inevitable. The entire world is a playground and a temple.
On this path the chances for catastropohe are great unless a powerful guru’s protection is provided. The sexual rituals which have made tantra notorious are part of vama marge.

Panch amakara.

Sattvic people naturally enjoy ample sattva (balance of mind and alertness) and do not require external aids to worship. They utilize the meat of silence, the fish of breath control, the grain of concentration techniques the wine of god intoxication, and the coitus of one’s ego with the absoluute.

There is no freedom from delusion without enjoyment - enjoyment refers to the acceptance of all phenomena which may occur to an individual, be they ‘good’ or ‘bad’. 

Such self-delusive activity reinforces the crystallizations of the personality which prevent spiritual progress.

Ordinary sex is no sacrifice. When two people come together to copulate they usually seek gratification for themselves, the slaking of their lust. Perhaps indirectly they will try to satisfy their partners. Tantric sex becomes possible only when one has totally effaced one’s own personality and offers oneself for the gratification of the deity, the universe incarnate.
This is one reason tantra has always been a closely guarded secret. The danger of abusable knowledge falling into the hands of the unworthy has limited its spread. One should never seek to practice classical tantr without a guru because no tantric texts exist which provide thoroughly accurate details of any ritual. Each text omits an essential step, or includes false information, and only through a guru can the reality, handed down through generations, be known.

Unfortunately even the tantric attitude can be dangerous. As one accumulates power, the ego will balloon out unless the personality is continuously incinerated simultaneously. Hence Tantra’s insistence that power be objectified and personified.

All males should learn motherly love. Motherliness. Worship of mother; a method for inculcating maternal feelings.

Tantra has thus far been glimpsed in the west only in its most vulgar and debased forms, promulgated by unscrupulous scoundrels who equate sex with superconsciousness. Sex is indeed central to tantra, the cosmic sexual union of universal dualities. The aim of tantra is laya, return of the seeker to the state of undifferentiated existence.  It consists only of methods ofr achieving this Laya, or union of the individual with the infinite. 

The Left-hand path has attracted attention to itself by the actions of those unwise souls who seek quick and easy spiritual development without any preliminary renunciation of sensory gratification. The result of suhc rashness is invariably indulgence of the worst and most blatant sort.
Most serious practitioners shun the left hand path because of its potential for misuse, which is great. It is truly treacherous for the unwary: walking on swords or riding a tiger is child’s play by comparison.
Aghora is not indulgence; it is the forcible transformation of darkness into light. Renunciation disappears once you arrive at the absolute because then nothing remains to renounce. An aghori goes so deeply into the darkness, into all things undreamable to ordinary mortals, that he comes out into light. 
—Popularly, aghoris have been stereotyped as ash-swathed ascetics with long matted hair who walk through life wild-eyed, skulking about in charnel grounds, wrestling with jackals for carcasses. 

To vimalananda, the true aghori cannot be recognized by any external sign or mark. Experience in the world of ascetics had taught him that many fake aghoris lurk under outward appurtenances. The true aghora is wholly internal. 

To his spiritual children he was the perfect mother - to those with inflated spiritual egos he was merciless.

Death is to be personified and deified. They crave not physical death, but for destruction of all their limitations, ‘killing’ themselves by internal or external processes. 

‘Filth and orgies in the graveyard’ can be as conducive to spiritual advancement as can asanas, pranayama, and other purer disciplines.

Aghora is mysterious and deep - deeper than deep, in fact - and only those who can lay aside all their cultural clothing and plunge into it naked can dive into it’s depths.

He wanted to warn spiritual dilettantes in the west that the frivolity with which they treat discipline and the self-delusion they attempt to pass fof as enlightenment is merely a cheating of their own consciousness whcih leads only to the pit.
Has the kundalini shakti become so cheap that some so-called godman can awaken it in multitudes of people all at once? NO! Were our Rishis (ancient seers) fools to spend decades out in the jungles working hard at penances to waken kundalini and to perfect aghora? No, the people who think they can buy kundalini are fools. Westerners think they can purchase knowledge, but all they get for their money is fake teachers from india who dish out any slop to them and get rich on their gullibility.

Most people who know him only formally never suspected that he might be ofa spiritual bent. He cultivated this carefree image deliberately to avoid attracting attention to himself. Ate meat on occasion, intoxicants, smoked cigarettes incessantly.
He made a show of complete disinterest in teachign while actually spending much time evaluating the strenghts and weaknesses of each of his spiritual “children”. 
Tortoise teacher - pay no attention to progress, but in reality monitors them closely, like a tortoise burying eggs in sand.

When he decided I should learn something he would deftly insert it into a flood of mundane trivialities directed at others in the room and would expect me to be alert enough to pick it out. Weeks or months later he would question me about it, without warning. - what use is an exam if you’re warned about it ahead of time.

Me-when you are with a lover you are a different person. Why not be that person to all people, all the time?

His impression on people was achieved primarily not by what he did, but by how he did it; not by what he said, but by how he said it. Who he was was more significant than what he did, but he made people dig for his interior reality and most often they would come up empty-handed.  Those few who knew him well - at least superficially - could never agree with each other on who he was, because his personality differed for each of his friends. He was a multitude of different people, all in one body.
His foster daughter had the last word, “No one has any business to read about you because unless they have experienced you they could never know the reality.”

Spoke mainly for indians, who often inflate the content of events they report. Indian listeners have learned to automatically compensate for this expansion by mentally scaling down whateveris said.

Ability to change eye color at will.

Even if the child is wicked or wayward, do the parents stop loving it? No! In fact, if they are true parents they will love the child all the more, because that child gives them the opportunity to demonstrate their generosity and love, just as in the case of the prodigal son. It is an opportunity to feed the ego.

Full-bellied, pot-breasted


Thuggee (UK: /θʌˈɡiː/, US: /ˈθʌɡi/) refers to the acts of the Thugs, who were organised gangs of professional robbers and murderers. The English word thug traces its roots to the Hindi ठग (ṭhag), which means 'swindler' or 'deceiver'. Related words are the verb thugna ('to deceive'), from the Sanskrit स्थग (sthaga 'cunning, sly, fraudulent') and स्थगति (sthagati, 'he conceals').[2] This term, describing the murder and robbery of travellers by a cult group of Kali worshippers, was popular in the northern and eastern regions of historical India (present-day northern/eastern India and Bangladesh).
Thugs are said to have travelled in groups across the Indian subcontinent.[3] Thugs are said to have operated as gangs of highway robbers, tricking and later strangling their victims. To take advantage of their victims, the thugs would join travellers and gain their confidence, which would allow them to surprise and strangle the travellers with a handkerchief or noose.[4] They would then rob and bury their victims.[5] This led to the thugs being called Phansigar (&quot;using a noose&quot;), a term more commonly used in southern India.[6] During the 1830s, the thugs were targeted for eradication by the Governor-General of India, Lord William Bentinck, and his chief captain, William Henry Sleeman.

The Thug preference for strangulation might have originated in a quirk of the law under the Mughal Empire, which ruled most of India from the 1500s.[36] For a murderer to be sentenced to death, he or she must have shed the blood of their victim. Those who murdered but did not shed blood might face imprisonment, hard labor and paying a penalty—but they would not risk execution. 

According to colonial sources, Thugs believed that they played a positive role in saving human lives. Without the Thugs' sacred service, Kali might destroy all mankind:
&quot;It is God who kills, but Bhowanee has [a] name for it.&quot;
&quot;God is all in all, for good and evil.&quot;
&quot;God has appointed blood for [Bhowanee's] food, saying 'khoon tum khao': feed thou upon blood. In my opinion it is very bad, but what can she do, being ordered to subsist upon blood!&quot;
&quot;Bhowanee is happy and more so in proportion to the blood that is shed.&quot;[57]
The Muslim thugs, while retaining their monotheistic faith, had functionalised Bhavani for Thuggee and she was syncretised as a spirit subordinate to Allah. A Muslim thug caught by Sleeman stated &quot;In my heart, I take the name of God, when I strangle a man – saying &quot;thou God and ruler!&quot; &quot;Alla, toomee Malik!&quot; I do not pray to Bhowanee, but I worship her.&quot; Other Muslim thugs who had agreed to testify for Sleeman, stated they had assimilated Bhavani and started the practice of thugee.[58]

Guy rapes a girl - and besides, there must have been some karmic connection there, otherwise there never would have been an opportunity for him to be alone with her long enough to rape her. Had this old man been in his senses he could have postponed the repayment of this karmic debt for some future lifetime, but because his balance of mind was lost, his natural underlying lust which had been suppressed all those years suddenly spurted out. It is a fine thing to collect great spiritual power, but you are headed for trouble if you ever lose control over it.

Explain inequality based on past lives. One guy summons god faster than another because they’ve been doing it in past lives.



Clairaudient and clairvoyant. I can go anywhere in the world without leaving my chair; nothing can be hidden from me.

The source of all knowledge. The source of delusion and the release from delusion. 

There is no edge between delusion and enlightenment.

People who worship children. Edgeless minds. Some go so far as to avoid teaching them language.

Eventually adya herself begins to become individualized. Within her, separate egos develop and become individuls. At some point these proliferated forms begin to grope for the ultimate. At this point the universal soul gets the observers he had yearned for.

Something about nature being the crucible of identity. Nature was made to make individuals, and individuals to make nature. Personality, ego, is not to be destroyed. It is to be cultivated

Me - Everyone lives in their own world where everyone else is crazy. The vegetarian who sits and wonders at the barbarity of humans who eat meat, with no thought to the sufferings of animals, the motherliness inside the sow as her babies are slaughtered.

So-called humans who concern themselves of nothing but eating flesh and putting flesh into flesh. I believe in going beyond the skin, beyond the flesh, the bone, the marrow, and everything else, and getting to the essence.

I shoudl chop off your head to cure you of these malady, to free you from the grip of these snares.


Hand gesture as counting

You may do your best to communicate with dying poeople but it will not help much. They have already entered a different world. You will notice that a stage comes when the eyes begin to move rapidly and the lips form unintelligible words. If you know about death you will know that the individual is seeing chitragupta’s account book. Secrete pictures, images no one else can see. 

There is a way to force a person to be alert at themoment of death. You can actually force the ego bac into the conscious mind and then communicate with the dying person for a few minutes. But it is very difficult to do.

Death is not to be feared. Birth is to be feared.

A story of an old woman who was truly pious. She worshipped god regularly, daily for several hours, and in fact didn’t do much else. Towards the end of her life she became blind and had to grope from place to place, but this made her worship all the more perfecctly since she lost most of the distractions of the outside world along with her sight. 

At the time of cremation a pinda (ball of rice flour) is put out for crows to eat. The crow is a very smart bird. If a good observer is nearby he will notice that sometimes no crow will take the pinda. Now, the crows are always hungry and they would like to take it, but the spirit is hovering around the pinda and refusing to allow any crow to eat it. This is the only way the spirit can draw attention to itself.
This is how you can tell a spirit has an unfilled desire.

Treat your guest as god.
The aghori continued: “and I don’t want mutton or chicken. I want human flesh.
Sagal shah, resigned to his fate, said “all right, maharaj, I will have myself killed and cooked and served to you.”
This only made the aghori wilder. “Dunce! You are an old man. Think how stringy and tough your meat will be. I want a young child. Take his brains and fry them for me.
Sagal shah said, “I have a young son who is in school right now. I will go and bring him and have his brains cooked for you.” His wife, who was pregnant, also realized that it had to be done, to fulfill the vow.
Sagal shah went and found chelayya, his son, and asked him to come home with him. Before he could explain why, chelayya told him, “so that old fellow wants to fry my brains and eat them? All right, let us go there and I will see how he does it.”
His father should have suspected something when chelayya knew all about the aghori before being told. But sagal shah was too distraught over his son’s impending death to notice. How could chelayya know about it? He was something different; his own father had not realized who he was.
They went to sagal shah’s house and chelayya told the aghori, “so you’re trying to be funny, eh? Allright, do it! Go ahead!”
And he was slaughtered and his brains pulverized, and dish was prepared. The mortar and pestle in which his brains were mashed can still be seen on that island.
When the meat was set before the aghori, he became wilder still and refused to eat it, saying, “how can you expect me to eat food prepared by a barren woman? Shameless wretch!”
This was too much for sagal Shah’s wife, who said to him, “You damned aghori! Who do you think you are? I am pregnant, so you dare not call me barren. Now I am going to make you eat and I am going to watch and see how you do it!”
Suddenly, the aghori said to the corpse of the boy, “Get up!” and immediately the boy was standing there alive saying, “So?”
Then the aghori instantly bowed to chelayya and said to sagal shah, “request a boon!” Sagal shah replied, “Lord, what can I ask for? In kali Yuga no one is tested like this, and you have graced my by being born into my family. Now all that I can ask is that all in my family and all my descendants should have pure minds. Anyone who develops perverted intellect should be destroyed.
And to it has been until today.

Every action has an equal and opposite reaction - cause is effect concealed, and effect is cause concealed.

For example, if I steal something from you in this lifetime the opportunity for me to steal from you can arise only if a debt exists between you and me; only if you owe me something. If there is no bondage, I will not be able to locate your home, or will not find what I want even if I do burgle it. And if I steal from you, instead of receiving from you as a gift the thing I want, of your own free will, it is highly likely that you must have stolen from me in the past. Your past action creates a like attitude in me.  (then an unrepentant theif must have a lot of people who owe him)
In my case I am very anxious to finish off my cycle of births and deaths so I allow every person who has any rnanubandhana with me to take from me whatever they are entitled to. 
Karmic debt - rnanubandhana
Now, I know I have the advantage of knowing about my rnanubandhanas. But anyone, even someone who has no diea at all about whom he owes and who owes him, can make good use of this attitude. The more you scheme and plot to snatch from others the farther you bind yourself down in karmas. The freer you are, accepting when it is given and giving when it is requested, the mor eof your — are effaced and the closer you come to your goal.
The moment you act to protect what you feel to be your self-interest, your ego, karma adheres to you like mud.

WATtS - monotheists - the governing power of this universe has some extremely definite opinions and rules. If you don’t watch out, you’ll go against the grain of the universe and be punished-  burn in hell - fail to be an authentic person. There is authority behind the world, its far out.
There are a lot of people who never grow up and are always in awe of the image of grandfather - but grandfathers are dumb as fuck.

How  woudl you know if there was something good if there wasn’t something that wasn’t good at all.

You cannot appreciate the firm without the yielding . The so called negativity of the feminine principle is life giving and important. We live in a culture that doesn’t notice it. You see a drawing and dont notice the white paper underneath. You see a printed book and dont notice the page.


When you are wandering as a sadhu you run into all types of people. Many criminals masquerade as sadhus or fakirs in order to escape the police, and the police in order to catch such criminals masquerade the same way. There are men who run away from nagging wives or heavy debts or some other responsibility. There are magicians and men who cheat barren couples with promises of children. The whole flotsam and jetsam of society. Best way to know who is genuine and who is not is with a chillum of charas or ganja, because most sadhus are forbidden to drink.
Be sure to let that fellow light the chillum and take the first puff. First he will get the fire going for you so that you dont have to inhale too hard. Second, by his technique of holding the chillum and inhaling you will know whether he is an old crony, or a beginner, or just what. And as soon as he starts to get into his intoxication everything will come out; who he is, why he is moving as a sadhu, where he is going.


He is the shrewdest old man possible. If he wants to trick you, he’ll do it in such a way that he’ll have you admiring him for it.

            <Text>Namib-Naukluft park\

Soussusvlei is the single key attraction in the park, rivalled only by Etosha for the number of visitors.

How small a tree— looks like a tiny dust mote next to a dune.

‘Linear oases’ of ephemeral rivers to ease their passage through the desert to the coast.


While diamonds are still found, uranium is the new focus.

One of the enticements the namib exhibits to visitors is the small flying saucer beetles emerging on the dune surface in the pre-dawn to construct fog-capturing ridges. Hundreds of them can be seen on a single dune slipface, all parallel to eachother and perpindicular to the fog bearing wind. Cold, stiff, longlegged but flightless bettles poised on the dune crest face the fog-bearing winds while using their bodies to incercept the moisture. 
On the same afternoon, a white-lady spider turns over to form a ball and rolls down the dune sllpe, successfully escaping the large black wasp that has excaated her from her slilk-lined trapdoor nest.

Haigamkab- nama language - ‘place of abundant cold water’

While the Namib would be arid without the benguela, it wouldn’t experience the hyper-aridity, extensive gypsum plains, frewquent fogs and great diversity of life with which we are familiar. A unique climate and the dynamic interface between land and sea set the stage for the myriad interactions of geology, climate, plants and animals that comprise the namib landscape

The benguela is one of four major eastern ocean ocurrents dominated by a wind-driven upwelling system…the cold, nutrient-rich upwelling supports a large biomass fo plankton and fish, the plankton , settling on the ocean floor and decomposing without oxygen, provides the sulphur that has slowly built up the coastal gypsum plains and the occasional sulphur eruptino that causes havoc along the shore and a distinctive smell on land.

The namib desert would not be the hyper-arid place it is without the codl upwelling fo the benguela…the situation is brought about by a combination of global air circulation ,the location of the namib on the rain-shadow side of the african subcontinent, and currents in the coeans surrounding the southern part of the continent, particularly the cold b3enguela

Rippled crest. Smoking dune.

Winds bring dust, heat, and flies.

The difference in temperature between warm land (low air pressure)_ and cold sea (higher presusre) sets up a pressure gradient that is suffficient in itself to cause a breeze that blows from the sea on to the land. Due to the truning effect of corioolis force, …. 

Winds blowing from the north-west gbegin in the late afternoon and continue into the nitght. These dominate in summer. Plains-to-mountains winds, blwoing as a result of the thermal gradient between the cool western part of the desert and the hotter interior areas. At the same time they often bring fog.

In winter the influence of the south atlantic anticyclone weakens and teh south african anticyclone centered over the sub-continetn becomes more improtant. Hence the southerly winds are weak and are replaced by easterly to north-easterly winds. Souteh easterly down valley and mountain to plain winds also occur in winter, associated with drainage of cool air.

Windy - ‘the flies, driven in for shelter, rendered the house almost untenable’..

Today the east wind is sometimes judged by how many of the dashed white stripes in the middle of the road can be seen— only one or two means a really bad wind. 


Because there are dry layers of air far above the ground, the intensity of many of the individual showers is limited; when promising clouds penetrate these dry layers, much of their moisture is absorbed and never falls as rain. 

Fog produces five times as much moisture as rain in the central namib. 
Two types of fog. Within 15km of the coast, advective fog at less than 200 meteres high is borne inland on south-westerly winds, often arriving in teh afternoon. Such fog forms when humid air cross es the cold benguela and results in moderate precipitiation.
Intercepted, low stratus and strato-cumuls cloud is known as high fog, which forms about 100 -600 meters below a strong inversion layer. Can extend inland as far as the escarpment. Can be brackish, depending on how long the fog screen has been exposed to dust and wind.

Wheeling, screaming, diving terns.

Whether being sand-blasted, enduring salt spray, clothed in fog, having ground disappearing under their feet, or oconversly being buried under piles of sand in other places, coastal plants endure a harsh life along the namib coast.

Plaants in the namib desert very clearly respond to this coast-inland gradient. As you move away from teh coast, the vegetation changes from widely, but regularly spaced shrubs, which rely mainly on moisture provided by fog, to barren, open areas supporting short-lived grassland and herbs after good rains, to widely scattered shrubs and tress at the foot of the escarpment where higher rainfall starts supporting savannah vegetation. If you observe these patterns and measure the distance from the coast when driving …
Special to the namib are the gypsum plains, which are continuously being created by the interaction of sulphur of marine origin depositid on calcium-rich soil. Lichens— a combination of algae and fungi usually lacking common nanmes,— occur on the central namibs gypsum crusts in numbers and diversity unrivalled in any other place on earth. Lichen fields

Intricately-branched namib lichens almost resemble corals, such as the dominatn orange-coloured bushy species Teloschistes capensis. Others resemble old, dried leaves, like the wind-blown xanthomaculina convoluta, which is not connected to the ground and usually collects in depressions and drainage channels. In contrast to dune plants adapted to mobiel sand, lichens grow extremely slowly and henceforth require a stable substrate, yet, in turn, they further stabilise the surfae and prevent erosion of the soil.

The filigree of shallow watercourses which dissects many coastal plains often supports denser stands of plains vegetation. Pencil bush and dollar bush are found in great numbers here.

Thus the wide, expansive plains offer a pageant of subtly coloured landscapes, changing through each day and from season to season. The plains with their intruding inselbergs host a real m of plants and animals which, each in its own wayu, show the abundance of life in teh desert and the intriguing ways they have of coping with the hard conditions.

The surface rises gently, almost imperceptibly, from the coast to the base of the escarpment at about a thousand-meter elevation., an average inclination of 1degree.

The Namib Uncomfority Surface

The plains can be regarded as a pedi-plain, formed by a retreat of the escarpment and consisting of the products of that erosion.
 
Due to the slow rate of weathering of rocks and decomposition of organic matter on the Namib plains, soil formation is weak and slow. It is no surprise then, that Namib soils are generally thin, ‘raw’ in the sense of not being broken down very much form their parent material, often being coars adn gravelly, and low in nutrients,. Even so, namib soils are still invaluable for their role iof providing the home in which arid-adapted plants grow.

The surface of many desert soils is stabilised by a crust. This layer may comprise stones and pebbles that form a desert pavement of quartz, feldspar, rock fragments and coars e sand sitting on top of finer material. In many places the stones are sandblasted and polished by the wind, developing a striking varnish due to the presence of iron and manganese oxides. 
Soils with salt cursts are a strictly coastal feature in the Namib. THey form locally in depressions without drainage or in small valleys where water, supplied by underground seepage, evaporates, leaving its preciptate of salt at the surface. These pans are not pure white like pans in the interior, such as Etosha. They usually have a dirty surface made up of dust, sand and salt, buckeld into shards and crusts as the salt crystals have grown. Over time this may build up into a considerable layer that appears to be firm, but if broken through by a heavy weight(such as a car), it reveals a sludge from which the car will probably have to be towed.

Soils with gypsum crusts and gypsum cemented gravel and sand are found within about 60 km of the coast, coinciding with the zone of regular occurrence of fog. This area is home to one of Africa’s most extensive accumulations of gypsum. At the coast the gypsum crusts form a continuous cover up to four meters thick, and they become thinner indland, ocurrign only in small patches at the eastern limits. Thie crust usually consists of highly cemented gypsum crystals, growing either as tiny crystals or in the more conspicuous ‘desert rose’ form, lying beneath non-gypsic sediment. Gypsum soils have a spongy, highly porous structure, which explains the hollow sound of your footfalls when walking over these areas near the coast.

Controversy over origin.
The close association of they gypsum with the coast was originally attributed to eruption of hydrogen sulphide gas from the atlantic sea floor. It is not uncommon for the air in walvis bay and swakopmund to smell sulphurous (like rotten eggs), the result of natural eruptions of gas from decomposing ooze on the sea floor. The theory was that this gas dissolved into fog water, it formed weak sulphuric acid, which would react with calcium carbonate in the soil to form gypsum, a calcium sulphate mineral.
Recent work using chemical isotopes has shown that ‘rotten egg’ hydrogen sulphide from the saea cannot account for the widespread accumulation of gypsum. Namib fog is actually very pure and is not the source of the sulphur. But the link is still very much with the productive benguela current. Apparently sulphur is introduced into the system as atmospheric sulphate, which is produced in quantity by marine phytoplankton. Itis deposited on the desert surface, filters into the soil with fog and rain, and causes the alteration of the carbonate in the soil. 
A characteristic of the gypsum soils is the way they sometimes form ‘olygonal’ structures. These are most obvious after rainfall when differetnial grass growth reveals the boundariss of these polygons. The tentative explanation for these polygons is that they are the result of expansion and contraction of the gypsum in the soil, a process similar to the freezing and thawing of the tundra near the arctic circle. With the addition of water to the soil after a rainshower, the gypsum expands. As the soild dries, the gypsum contracts, often along lines that deliniate the polygons. As a result, after a rainshower the germinating grass may respond in several ways. If the polygon is defined by relatively narrow cracks in teh soil, the grass will find more moisture in these cracks and clearly outline the polygon. If the surrounding spaces between the gypsum plates are broader, the moisture will quickly penetrate into the soil and become unavailable to the germinating grasses. The result is two parallel rows of grass next to the edges of the polygon plates with bare soil in teh broad centre of the cracks. 

Lichens are not true plants, but form as the result of a beneficial association between fungi and algae, the fungus forming the body (called the thallus) and the attachment to the substrate, and the algal compontent doing the photosynthectic work. Lichens grow where there is a combination of light and high humidity, the light to provide the energy for photosynthesis, and the moisture to keep both partners hyudrated. Coastal fog desert.in the presence of fog, a lichen can increase its water content by more than 150% from dry to satureated. … The lichen then enters a state of ‘latent life’, dehydrated and inert until there is moisture in the air again.

Teloschitstes, known as a ‘fruticose’ lichen, forms cushhion-like tufts 3-10 centimeters high that are loosely connected to teh ground. Its branches give rise to many small thin hairs that enlarge the surface, probably facilitating the uptake of fog water. Other crustose kinds foudn covering the surface of pebbles are Xanthorea, and there are unattached, vagrant species such as xanthomaculina convoluta, usually found in mats where it accumulates in deprssions sheltered from the wind.

Calcrete plains

This is only possible because the pencil bush absorbs fog and stores it in its stems and roots. When it first germinates, many roots develop as with most other woody shrubs. But after several years it seems that most of the root hairs and smaller roots die off as the gypsum soil remains dry and only th emain root remains. 


In contrast, calicorema grwoing on teh calcrete plains to the east does not flower all year long but only during hte rainy season. Seeds that are shed one year remain viable until the next.

Welwitschia mirabilis

The icionic plant of the namib and namibia. It is a theme used on the surround walls of the new namibian state ouse.


Calcrete crusts are a feature of the soils further insland in the eastern part of the central namib and pro-namib. They have a less controversial origna than the gypsum crusts and simply represent a moister periof of in situ formation of calcrete and calcareous soil. This results from atmoshperic precipitation of calccium carbonate in a dry setting.

Grass growth on these calcrete plains is always a wondrous experience. Precipitation oin a good year in the central namib is considered to be anything over 20 millimetres. The effect of this rain is to produce short-lived grasslands. During dry times, the vegetation on the gravel plains is restricted to a few hardy perennail plants that grow mostly in dry washes. Grass cover from previous years may be reduced to zero before the next rain-fall, leaving no clumps or litter on the windswept ground surface.

Scorpions are highly successful in desert habitats. They have a very low metabolic rate, and are able to eat large quantities of food at one time. The mesosoma or ‘abdomen’ simply distends greatly according tot he size of the meal it catches. —12 monts of starvation in some species. Time minimzers. Spend 95% of time in their burrow.

Ariadna is yet another namib speciality. A spider. If you look closely at the ground, sweeping your eyes methodically over an area of namib gravel plain very slowly, there is a good chance you will find an entrance of an ariadna burrow. Its a tiny tunnel in the ground no more than two or three millimeteres in idameter, but what makes it noticable is the tidy pattern of quartz grains that surround it like the petals of a daisy. While other ariadna species construct stone circles around their burros, they are more usually composed of several layers of stones. S

The barking geckos, of the genus ptenopus, have a loud and distinctive call, similar to the noise produced by tapping two pebbles together in quick succession. The three species can all be heard at goabeb and elswhere on warm calm evenings, especially when it is humid. Only the males cally, lying at the entrance of their burrows. 

Birds that are independent of drinking water must take in moisture in their food or must be able to create it from their own metabolic processes. Reducing loss of water is therefore critical. Like reptiles birds excrete nitrogenous waste in teh form of uric acid, the white paste in a bird’s faeces, thus reducing the amount of water that is expelled. Moisture is also lost when water is used for evaporattive cooling, and birds use a process called gular flutter when heat stressed. The floor of the mouth iand throat are pulsated rapidly, pumping air to and fro over the wet surface to create a cooling effect with relatively little expenditure of energy.

Ludwig’s bustard. They have been noted in teh sand dunes of the namib gorging on tenebrionid beetles when their populations rise after good rains.

Ruppell’s korhaan, the ‘namib frog’. Strange, frog-like croaking duets.

In fact, the large size of the ostrich is an advantage, as the body has a comparatively smaller surface area exposed to the heat than does a small body with a large surfact-to-volume ratio. The large, loosely arranged feathers are manipulated so that, whin it is hot, they are held erect to give shade to the body and allow movement of air close to teh surface of teh skin. At the same time the wings are drooped and the body is orientated relative tot he sun so that the bare skin of the thorax and thighs is also shaded yet open to be cooled by the slightest breeze. 

On cold nights they face the opposite problem. Now they flatten the feathers on the back to trap an insulating layer of air. They huddle down tot hte ground, with legs tucked underneath them and any bare skin well covered. 

When looking at the faeces of ostriches, you can discern the state of hydration of the bird when the faeces were excreted. The birds tolerate saline water, and can withstand a loss of one quarter of their body weight during dehydration. Selectively graze plants with a high water content. 

The quick response of ostriches to rain in the namib is well known. They are always the first large animals to converge on a new patch of greenery, and congregations of 100 or 200 birds can be seen, usually in late summer, markingj the limits of an isolated fall of rain.

MOuntains

The rugged mountains of the Naukluft form an imposing eastern edge to the coastal plain of the central Namib.

The mountains are heavily dissected,. 

Seen from afar the mountain is surprising ly flat topped and plateau-like, constituting a protion fo the great western escarpment that runs paralllel to the namib desert.

Dolomites, limestone, and wshale dominate the mountain, with minor snadstones, conglomerates and tillites that are important for stratigraphic correlation.  The dolomites nad limestones are karstified and, although no large caves are knmown, pools of water emanating from the rocks are abundant, providing sustenance to a wide variety of animals resident ont eh mountain. 

High biodiversity…deep weathering features that act as refuges for flora and fauna.
570 million years ago. At tath time the Congo and Kalahari cratons (continental cores) converged with near simultaneous collision of another craton from the west. Prior to the convergence of the cratons, deep sedimentary basins separated them. As they collided, the sediments that had accumulated in these basins were squashed and crumpled to form a majro-fold mountain belt that marked the suture zone.  This was accompanied by over-thrusting fo the rock pile south-westwards. Initially the rocks were thrust one on top of the other in whatis called a nappe complex. If you push a tablecloth from one side, the rumpling of the cloth over the sheet in front in multiple folds is analgous to what happened. 

Glaciers are the most pwerful erosive forces on earth and itis probable that the ruggedly fold-ed mountain tops were flattened by continental glaciers, giving the naukluft its high plain.

A fluttered flute of a whistle from the path.
Ayram pursed his lips and came .
Moteah rushed in, crouched, her red cloak bunched up at her feet and in a hurried whisper she said, “There’s an ambush. Only a few hundred yards ahead.”
“How many men?” Ayram whispered back.
“I Counted twelve. Couldn’t be more than twenty in all.”
Moto came stumbling in. “I counted fourteen. It’s an wider valley,” he said. “With a tall slope,” he flattened his hand in the air to illustrate the incline, nearly plumb. “At the top it’s a vertical wall of rock.”
“A canyon,” Moteah clarified.
“And at the bottom of this valley, there’s a boulder the size of Minting Rock sitting right in the middle, plugging the gap.”
“Is it impassible?” Ayram asked.
Moto said, “There’s a narrow tunnel carved into the bottom, tall enough for a horse. The ambush is set on the other side of this tunnel.”
“I bet they’ve pushed that boulder down themselves,” Moteah said.
Moto sighed and squatted down. His face contorted into a look of pained stress. “What’s strange is that there’s a man sitting at the tunnel entrance, pretending to be a traveler. At least that’s what I think he’s doing, cause he’s got a traveler’s pack.”
“It’s bait,” said Moteah
“But what do they need bait for?” Moto asked. “They’ve got the ambush set, just spring it! Don’t need to put a man down in the valley where he’s liable to get pricked.”
Ayram folded his arms.
Scratched his nose.
Rubbed his bushy brow with his finger and thumb.
“Thirty men, you say?”
“Twenty at most,” said Elrahet.
“I counted fourteen,” Moto reminded everyone.
Ayram drummed his fingers against his chin, then tugged at his bottom lip. He was such a perfect picture of indecision, that Mandri nearly asked for a slip of paper so that he could draw it, and not just Ayram, the scene itself. Sometime nature has a way of organizing itself into a natural composition. Ayram there, standing tall, his head the apex of a pyramid of people, all looking at him for direction, and the weight of their expectations sat heavy on his brow.
It was Elrahet who broke the edge. Her words a firm encouragement. “We are going through,” she said.
“They know we’re coming, that much is clear. Still, it is only twenty… though we’ve only five arrows between us.”
He turned his cutting eye to Obo and said, “I don’t suppose you’d be any help.”
Obo lit up with astonishment. A cheeky split his lips as he watched everyone watch him.
“Aren’t I alluring…” he said.
“Right now, they’re sitting there stewing, wondering why we haven’t shown up.”
“And let me guess, you’re thinking we should all amble right on into that trap, spring it, and when all the little weeds sprout out from behind the rocks, have me deal with them.”
“You killed fifty of my own people in a ravine. In the rain. With the light of day, you could kill twenty freaks with one flick of your neck.” 
“I admit that I could, but I’m surprised you’re willing to put all these lives in my hands.”
“I’m not. It’ll just be you and me.”
“Oh?”
“I’m going to carry you into that ambush, and when those demons pop out of their hiding places, you’re going to blast their heads into oblivion.”
“Is that what I’m going to do?” said Obo.
Ayram and knelt down .
“You’re going to do it, because there’s no scenario here where you betray me and walk out alive.”
“I thought you understood that threats have no effect on me.”
Ayram. 
“It’s either you agree to do it, or you die.”
Obo contemplative moment.
“I know that stress has a way of narrowing vision, but there is an infinite number of ways you could approach my reluctance to comply with your desires. There’s really no need to compress it down to two. If you asked me, I think you should explore the possibility space of -”
Interrupted when Ayram slammed his chisel in the rock right next to Obo’s neck. 
Obo glanced at the cold iron bar which brushed his skin and said, “Look, I’ll do it.” He then pointed to the spud bar and said, “But this isn’t why I’m going to do it. I’ll do it on the condition that you open your heart to good graces of your nature and say, ‘thank you’.”
“You’ll get no pleasure from me.”
“I didn’t ask for pleasure, I asked for thanks. A good, honest, ‘Thank you!’. That’s all. Acknowledgment that I helped, and that I helped even though I did need to.”
Ayram stood up and straightened his back. As his taught lips squirmed in , as if the words left such distaste.
 “This is ridiculous,” said Elrahet as she stepped forward. She stuck out her proud chin and said, “I’ll say thank you.”
Obo smiled and said, “That would be sufficient.”
Elrahet cleared her throat, and said, “Thank you, creature.”
“I don’t want to take advantage,” said Obo, “but could you say it once more without the ‘creature’?”
“Thank you.”
Obo pretended to pinch the words with his fingers, and then in a rectifying tone he said, “Thank you, Mazydobo.”
Elrahet grinned, of a person eager to show that their immune to , said, “Thank you, Mazydobo... Will that do?”
“It will.”
“Good. Now, go and murder those miscreants.”
Obo flourished his arms and bowed as deeply as he could. “I am at your service,” he said.
Seb cried, “We can’t trust him!”
Moto nodded. “Seb’s right,” he said. “This creature has no cause to help. It would be suicide to stride into a nest of bows with him at your back.”
“I know that you don’t have a reason to trust me, but that’s only because you haven’t given me the chance to prove that I’m trustworthy. This is such an opportunity, if Ayram is willing to give it.”
“Ayram… twenty bows means you’re liable to get pricked.”
“I’ve been tickled with arrows before,” said Ayram.
“I had to bring you back from that,” Elrahet grumbled. “I won’t be able to help this time.”
Moteah was the only one with determination. “There’s no way around,” she said. “At least, none we can take without running into Hrks.” 
“It’s either this, or we start from scratch.”
“We should go together,” Purl said.
“No,” said Ayram. “More bodies won’t help.”
Mandrameen listened with rapt attention, for the occasion had his heart aflutter with a restless energy, like he’d just drank a quart of burn-nut tea. His arms and legs felt curious, and there was an urge to inject himself into the situation.
And there was a logic to him getting involved.
Obo needed to be carried into a dangerous place, and Mandri had been carrying Obo for days. Why stop now?
There was chance whoever did it could be killed, and Mandri had been cheating death for the past few weeks. Why stop now?
The universe was lining him up for this.
On top of it all, he had Sob’s lucky rocks. He didn’t believe in luck, but the fact he had the rocks at all was a sign of his auspicious future, it was part of the theme, as the Solitants say, ‘when Solraheen speaks to you, it’s not in words, it’s in coincidences.’ He was given those rocks so that they could encourage him now, in this moment, a against is robe, and when this emotion reached the boiling point, he stood up straight and blurted out, “I’ll do it.”
The words landed amongst the Ayram like a duck. Moto looked at Mandri like he’d just . Elrahet, like a . Purl snorted in disbelief. Moteah heard but pretended she hadn’t. Ayram smirked, and said, “Now’s not the time, Mandri.”
“Look,” said Mandri, “All you need is someone to walk into that ambush… I’m willing to do it.”
Moto said, half in jest, “Mandri, Now him, we can’t trust.”
“What’s there to trust?” Mandri asked. “I walk over there, and Obo blasts them all to Shis.”
“He’s serious,” Moteah said with a hint of amusement.
“He does have a death wish,” said Moto.
“This isn’t about that eunuch prophecy is it?” Purl asked.
Mandri said, “A little.”
A muted laugh , and Moteah shook her head and Mandri’s naivety. 
This was no laughing matter to Elrahet. Her visage was stone serious. “Many have died testing prophecy,” she said. “It is not a wise thing to do.”
Mandri said, “I should have died like ten times already. And I can tell by the fact that none of you are outright shutting me down, that you all like the idea. I know Ayram does.”
Ayram was a rigid pole. “I’m trying to think of a reason not to let you do it,” he said.
“Worst that can happen is I die,” Mandri said. “And let’s be honest, it’s better me than you.”
“Can’t argue with that,” said Seb.
Ayram shot Seb a annoyed look, then held Mandri in his disquieting gaze. A pregnant silence emerged in that little interstice, and a doubtful anxiety started to creep up Mandri’s spine. He decided that if he just started acting, that put an end to it. It would shift Ayram’s burden from one of command, to a reserved acceptance of this new reality.
He bent down, picked up Obo’s litter, which still had Obo strapped in it, and then shouldered the burden and said, “Alright. Now which way is my uncertain death?”
“Hold on,” Ayram said. He placed his massive hand on Mandri’s shoulder. “Wait.”
Then Ayram turned to Moto and said, “Take what arrows we have and get up as high as you can.”
Without so much as a nod, Moto set to gathering what he’d need.
“And you,” Ayram said to Obo, “If this boy comes out of this unhurt, then I’ll say thank you.”
Ayram pointed out the path, a pitted road of sand that under a shelf of rock, and said, “Just follow it.” And so Mandri did.




He followed the path east as it wound through the shattered mountain. He felt like a hunter, careful to soften is footfalls, eyes trained on, limbs . He peeked around every rock and bend, should . 
Obo, impatient with this , said, “I’ll tell you when we’re almost there.”
But of course. Obo could . This reminded Mandri of something he’d been meaning to ask the Mazyd but hadn’t got the privacy to do it.
“Hey Obo?”
“What?”
“When the Ayramun ambushed you, did you let it happen?”
“What makes you think I’d do something as silly as that?”
“You can see through rock, can’t you?”
“I can not.”
“Then how are you always noticing things before anyone else.”
“I can see around rocks with sound. Sound bounces off of things, and it bounces off them differently depending on the surface, be it rock, dirt, or lizard skin. Such adumbrations provide a fuzzy image of the contents of the room I’ve yet to enter, or the layout of the canyon ahead.”
“So you can hear an ambush before you walk into it?”
“There’s also smell. I can smell our friends already. If a creature is large enough, I can smell it from miles away, so long as the wind blows the reek in my direction. But I’ll know we’re close when I can hear them breathing.”
“How far away would that be?”
“It depends.”
“On what?”
“It’s not worth explaining.”
“Why not?”
“Lower your voice.”
Mandri lowered his voice to a whisper. The satisfaction of a penetrated truth was “So, you did get captured on purpose!”
“I did.”
“And you got captured because you wanted to get close to Ayram.”
“I wanted to get close to Elrahet.”
“Well, that’s what I meant. But Elrahet is Ayram’s witch, and I don’t think Ayram will ever come around to giving you your freedom.”
“It’s not Ayram whom I’ve to convince.”
“Ayram won’t let Elrahet do anything without his say-so.”
“Is that so?”
“What are you on about? Of course it’s so. His name is Ayram, and she is Ayramun. And if that weren’t enough, he’s ten heads tall and his hand could crush a skull.”
“Mandri, the woman has power over life and death itself, and you think she’s not in control?”
The thought stopped Mandri in his tracks.
He tilted his head and looked aimlessly at the sky, which was beset with first few tufts of wispy cloud he’d seen in a week.
Was Elrahet in charge?
Was there something he hadn’t seen?
Nope.
“Mandri, keep moving.”
“Look,” Mandri said as he continued on walking. “I’ll defer to you on the subject of adumbrations, but clearly, you don’t know shit about people. Ayram’s in charge of all the Ayramun, and that’s that.”
“So you say.”
“Don’t ‘so you say’ me.”
“You want me to do you the dignity of 
“You’re correct in that I don’t know what it feels like to be a human, but there’s what it feels like to be you, and then there’s what you actually are, and I know what you actually are. You think that you’re some prophesied eunuch, but what you are is a boy with a burgeon addled brain, susceptible to flights of fancy, and these have led to the present moment where you walk dumbly into certain death, save for my goodwill. I’ve half a mind to let you die to teach you lesson.”
“You could let me die, but you won’t.”
“Forgive me, I said ‘teach a lesson,’ when I should have said ‘I’ll let you die to prove I’m right’, because for me, that’s a more attractive motive.”
“You wouldn’t do it.”
“We’ll find out soon. Just two bends left to go.”
The sudden awareness of flooded in. Confident yes, but he’d be lying if there fear wasn’t motivating his legs into.
Mandri walked, and when he came to the second bend, a shadowed, Obo told him to stop.
“I want to a clear sight of what we’re up against.”
Mandri peeked around first.


“Here’s the deal, Mandri. That man is dangerous.”
“I know that. He’s a cannibal…”
“I can not.”
“Alright. Welp. Here goes nothing.”
“Hoooold on, Mandri. Hold on.”
“What for? He’s bait, 
“He’s not bait. There’s no need for bait in this pass, as this is the only route a traveler can take.”
“Then what’s he there for?”
“If I had to guess, he’s going to waylay you with a disarming tale.”
“He’s a distraction?”
“Not quite. If I’m correct, then he’s going to want to get close to you.”
“So he can kill me.”
“No, so that he can kill me… I should lay this all out, as I see it. See, I think these bandits know more about our coming than just our number. I think they know of Ayram, and I think they know of me, and I think, that they think, that the best way to take out a Mazyd, if you haven’t a Riga, is to get close with deception and cut off the unsuspecting head. If I’m right, the trap won’t spring until I am killed.”
“How could they possibly know all that?”
“I believe they’ve been forwarned.”
“By who?”
“I have my suspicions.”
“But what about-”
“Sol’s breath, Mandri. Shut up for a moment!”
Mandri composed himself.
“Now, provided what I’ve said is true, that man has probably been told your description, and if he has, then he’s also been told that you’re the one who’s been carrying the Mazyd these long miles. He is going to try and get close to you to sniff me out. So please, for both our sakes, keep a good distance away from him.”
“What if he wants to shake hands?”
“Don’t.”
“Well, what am I supposed to say?”
“He knows who you are, so be honest, but twist it. Sprinkle the lie with grains of the truth. Say you’ve walked ahead of the others, and that they won’t be long behind. If he’s dumb, it’ll get him salivating.”
“What am I supposed to say if he wants to shake hands? I can’t just say no. That’s weird.”
“Mandri, improvise. You’ve a wit, so use it.”
“Alright,” Mandri said. He enjoyed the sense of 
“And one last thing,” Obo said. “What’s your favorite word?”
“I don’t have a favorite word.”
“Pick one at random.”
If Mandri was going to pick a favorite word, it wasn’t going to be at random. It was going to be a word that he liked, a bubbly word, fun to say, a word the captured something of his verve, and his taste for the divine, a word that, when spoken, could turn heads, and end all debate.
“My favorite word is Mandrameen”, he finally said.
Obo tsked, his voice threaded with a snarky gilt. “Pride is so repulsive. Especially in a human. At least when a lizard puffs its chest it does it because it knows its small.”
“It’s not about pride.”
“Whatever you say, Mandrameen.”
“Why’d you even ask?”
“Because when I’m ready to fill these heathen’s heads with the good word of Solraheen, I shall warn you first by saying your name. And when I say it, do not move. I can’t stress this enough - Do. Not. Move. Don’t crouch, don’t cringe, just stay perfectly still. You’re going to want to fling yourself about in terror, but if you don’t stand still, it’s going to mess everything up.”
Mandri glanced once more at the man. The frenzied whispering hadn’t ‘woken’ him up. There was little chance the had even reached him above his soaring snores.
“I’m excited,” Mandri said.
“You should be terrified. And remember,” Obo whispered. “Keep away from -”
“I know, I know,” Mandri said. “Keep away. Don’t move. I got it.”
Mandri chuckled at Obo’s harrumph, and then he stepped out the shadow of the canyon and walked towards the boulder and cannibal, keeping a steady, congenial smile. When he was near enough to formalize a greeting, he waved, but the man did not stir.

But over time, the price of admission increased, and soon the charge rivaled that of the Solki ferrymen. Eventually, only kings and merchants could afford to make the journey, and the required tithes trimmed their profit margins so terribly, that there was little point in using the overland pass. So, the Solki people decided to take up arms against the Skinarun.
There were no great battles with thousands of troops set against each-other in formation. It was a war of skirmishes, famine, and attrition, and it lasted for more than fifty years, but the outcome was rarely in doubt, for the Skinarun had overplayed their hand. Eventually, the foundation of Sinarun temple was laid to waste in the Sand, its walls destroyed not by an army, but by builders pilfering the abandoned city for dressed stone. 
When Solraheen returned to the world, much effort was made to hide the iniquities that had occurred in and around. The land was given to the Greskalun, who were charged with keeping a seal of peace upon the pass, and keeping the way open to profit.


didn’t a tribe called the Skinarun took up a task for themselves: Make sure no one enters this pass, so that no spreads a curse out into the peoples the world. They built a city at the western mouth to keep the way shut, and this they did for a thousand years, until one Skinarun king had had enough. She said that this king had argued that it wasn’t him who had asked Solraheen to part the mountains, that it wasn’t him who sought to ‘fix’ creation, and so the curse did not apply to him. He argued that the sense of justice written on his heart imputed the knowledge that it was wrong to punish a child for the sins of the farther, so it would therefore be unjust for Solraheen to punish him for the sins of their forebears. Therefore, he came to believe that it must be no great sin to travel the pass, so long as he did it with a mindful reverence for the lesson that the pass teaches.



“I want you and your sister to scout ahead, the whole length of the pass. If there’s people, if there’s an ambush, I want to know about it.”
“That will take a few hours.”
“We need to know what we’re walking into. The rest of us will find a place to keep out of sight, near this spot.”
“I should go too,” said Seb.
“Two is enough.”
Both Moto and Moteah dropped their shimmied out of their packs and Moto pulled out two long sandstone-colored cloaks, tossed one to Moteah, and then they clambered up the southern slope and disappeared from view.
Ayram led the everyone else back east, where he’d seen a shallow mouth in the base of the northern slope, obscured, in part, by pillar of rock that looked like a giant seed. They all tucked themselves behind this pillar, so that an idle eye of anyone wandering by wouldn’t be able to see them.
Mandri settled in for a nice, long wait.


“You going to kill me, or just take my things?” Mandri asked.
“I’m thinkin’ you have the wrong idea here, bud.”
“Do I?”
“We’re no highwaymen. We’re keepers of the peace. Schisol’s kin been flockin’ east these past weeks. We hatched this plan to sniff them out, see, they can’t resist easy meat.” He presented himself with open palms. “I show myself as a lonesome walker, and when the bastards reveal themselves for monsters, my boys riddle them with arrows.”
“Two men ain’t gonna cut it.”
“Works like a charm most times, but you seen right through it. And it leaves you in a fix. Because how am I to know whether or not you’re a demon? Because you sure as Shis look like you’ve been feastin’ on tainted flesh.”
“Excuse me, nothing is wrong the pallor of my skin. If anyone looks like they’ve been eating people, it’s you.”
Mandri felt Obo stir in the litter.
“Well, I sure do feel like Mandrameen right now.”



Ayram handed Mandri a few strings of jerked beef, a morning present to liven his spirits, and this it did with some aplomb for the beef was spiced with peppercorn and, at some point in it’s humble existence, had been soaked in a honeyed jelly.



Ayram nudged the man’s left leg with his toe. 
Moto asked, “Is he drunk?”
“Don’t think so.”
Ayram 
The man started to with a jolt. 
“Huhhh!?”
His eyes took in Moto’s, and then Ayrams. Instead of , he smiled and said, “Friends!”
The man shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his top-heavy pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.
“Name’s Testy,” the man said. He held out his hand for Ayram to shake.
“Mind moving out of the way, Testy?” said Ayram.
“Aye, I will! But could I trouble you for a bit?”
Moto dropped his hand to his hilt and said, “Are you a highwayman, Testy?”
“No! Not me, no!” said Testy as his eyes . “I’m nothing of the sort. Just a man making his way to Jeket, same as you, I suppose. Just don’t like walking all that way by myself. I get bored.”
“We’re not looking for company.”
“Sure, but I was hopin’ a good-natured soul like yourself would pass by and do me a kindness.” 
He looked at Ayram with expectant eyes.
“I’m good in a scrap. Even got my own blade.”
Testy pulled a short sword from a concealed sheath that was stitched into his pack. The blade was an exquisite piece, patterned steel, and the rim of was was rimmed with smooth amber.
The sudden appearance of a blade. He heeded Obo’s advice and stepped back. “You’re making me nervous, Testy.”
Testy looked up and laughed at Ayram’s reticence. “Apologies. Apologies,” he said. “Just wanted to show you, is all. It’s brand new.”
“Yes, I can see.”
Testy twirled the blade under his arm, and in one smooth motion, without looking, sheathed it back in his pack. Mandri supposed this little flourish was a show to let everyone know that Testy wasn’t one to be trifled with.
“Got to keep vigilant,” said Testy. “These days is tainted.”
“Is they?”
Testy nodded, his incapable of anything but certainty. “There’s rumors of foul folk breeding in the desert. Demons. Ilk wearin’ in the skins of men.”
“Demons?”
“And the weather has been acting strange. That much I felt since I left Sicrimo. And the past few days I seen a darkness off in the north.”
“The weather has been strange. But what’s this you say about demons?”
“Haven’t seen any myself, but you hear tell of unnatural things wandering out of the heat, lookin like men, but ain’t men. Unnaturally big…” wary eye. “Bit like you, if I’m honest.”
Ayram laughs. Amused beneficence. Eyed him up and down.
“You think I’m a demon?”
“You ain’t got horns or anything.”
“But you think I’m unnatural?”
“Look, I ain’t trying to get on bad terms with a man I aim to walk with. You a big guy, is all. You hear rumors about big guys, but, you know, you never see them.”
Ayram looks him over. Testy feels the eyes of everyone else. Curt nod.
“A dour bunch... Coming off hard times?”
“We don’t have time for introductions.”
“Why not?”
“You can walk with us, but you’ll be walking in front.”
“In front?”
“As I can keep an eye on you.”
“I get it. Look, you can trust Testy. As long as you keep good company, I’ll walk in front of yous to the edge of the earth if it need be.”
“We won’t be going so far.”
“How far?”
“Not far at all. We’re headed to see the Greskalun.”
“Right.”
Waves and smiles to the rest of the Ayramun, a curt introduction of travelers. Non smiled back.

“Shit
“Sure, sure. Off we go.” Testy bounced on his toes to settle his pack, and then walked into boulder’s round tunnel, his tall pack nearly scraping the roof. 
Ayram set after him. Everyone else holds.

Around a bend. 
Whistle.
Everyone stops.

Mandri looked again, then he saw, high up on a ridge was a boulder that looked like a shark’s tooth, and poking out from behind it, like a weed, was the wooden limb of a recurve bow.
“Hey, Testy!”
Greskal’s pack was so top heavy, that it took him five steps to turn around.
“What is it?” he asked.
“Cut the shit.”
“What’s this about?”
“I was under the impression that no one would dare to break the peace which has guarded this pass for a thousand years?”
“Well that’s a funny thing, ain’t it,” Bim said, impersonating Ayram’s growl, amusing himself as he did. “Outside this pass you can blood up to your heart’s content, but inside you can’t? I never did see the magick’d line in the dirt that separated good from evil. Just seems absurd, don’t it? The goodness of killin’ a man don’t depend on where you at. Like, ‘stand here and the killin’ is good, but do it not two toes to the left, and old Sol will damn your Spark to Shis.’ “
Bim added on, “They never questioned it, I guess.”
“Most don’t, most don’t. But it is what it is. Or at least, it was.” Greskal eyed the bright valley slopes, as if in that red rubble.
“Whatchya on about?” Greskal said as he trudged back towards Mandri. When he was within striking distance, Mandri pointed, and said, “There’s an interesting weed up there.”
Greskal face contorted as he saw .
A brusque, unintelligible whisper sounded out from the rocks above, and the wooden bow-tip was yanked out of sight.
Greskal shouted, “You know we can see you, right?”
A snarled retort sprang from the unseen heights. 
“You can’t see shit!”
Greskal laughed, then cupped his mouth and shouted, “You’ve botched it!”
A black, turbaned head sprouted up from the boulder above, “I didn’t botch nothin’!” the man said. “You botched it!”
Greskal looked to Mandri. “Who gave it away, him or me? It was him, right?”
“Do you put this show on for every traveler you rob, or is this the first time? I’ll tell you this, two men ain’t going to cut it with me.”

            <Text>https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/69558/pg69558-images.html

The Congo is said to be fifteen miles wide at the mouth--from hills to hills; but it does not look so wide because of the islands and mangrove swamps that hinder a clear view of the whole width, and narrow one’s vision to the channel in which you are steaming.
From my position I had an easy view of the deck of our small steamer. There were only two white men on board--a captain and an engineer; the former was a short man, who never spoke without swearing, and never gave an order without punching or kicking one of the black crew. He had a large rubicund nose, hideously coloured by frequent applications to the bottles that were always on his table. He was privately nicknamed by his crew as Red-nose, and was thoroughly feared and hated by them all. Many of them were slaves and could not get away from him, and others had contracted for one or two years’ service, and if they ran away they would have lost their pay; but notwithstanding this some did escape, preferring loss of pay to constant brutal treatment.

On reaching mid-channel I could see that the trading-houses of Banana were built on a narrow tongue of sand, having on one side the Atlantic Ocean constantly rolling and sometimes madly rushing as though it desired to tear the very tongue out of the mouth of the river; and on the other side the gentle lap, lap of a back current of the river itself. 

pulling up the whitebait thus caught, laid them on the rocks to dry 

 Others made small fences by the river’s bank about eighteen inches apart and three feet long, and into these they put small scoop-shaped nets, and drew up the small fish that had passed between the fences. 

The men soon had some fires lighted along the beach, and saucepans of food boiling on them, and pieces of meat roasting in the ashes. Groups gathered round the fires, and after a hearty meal of rice, ship-biscuits and meat, they became very talkative, and soon started asking riddles. Some of these riddles I still remember after all these 9changeful years; and I will try to tell you a few of them. 

 “I went to a strange town, and they gave me one-legged fowls to eat.” This one also was too difficult for them to guess, and after many attempts Semo had to give the answer, viz. Mushrooms, 


&quot;People do not seem to realize that their opinion of the world is also a confession of character.&quot;— Ralph Waldo Emerson

Soon after this the talk became general, and gradually died away as one by one they rolled themselves in their mats and went to sleep, leaving the fires brightly burning to throw out warmth to the sleepers and to frighten away hippopotami, crocodiles and sundry other creatures. 

During the night the snorting of hippopotami could be heard as they gambolled in the shallow water near the bank; and occasionally the switch of a crocodile became audible as it hurried by in search of food for its cruel but never-satiated jaws; many noises also came from the dark forest just beyond the settlement, that filled the night with weirdness and made the first glow of dawn welcome to men, birds and beasts.


Just opposite the store door was a large image, gaudily coloured and grotesquely ugly. It was a fetish[6] that the white man had bought of a native “medicine man,” and had placed it there in the store to frighten the natives and deter them from stealing. Of course it was no use, for the natives knew that no “medicine man” would sell a real fetish to the white man, consequently it did not overawe them, nor keep them from thieving when they had the opportunity. 

I had not been in the store many days when the box in which I was packed was carried out and handed over to some natives who had brought some tusks of ivory and rubber to the white trader 13for sale. From what I heard it had taken them a long time to settle the price; but directly that had been agreed upon they quickly selected their goods, viz. forty pieces of assorted cloth, ten barrels of gunpowder, fifteen flintlock guns, one box of brass rods, two demijohns or large bottles of rum, five cases of gin, and some common looking-glasses, knives, beads and various other trinkets. 

“Pish!” exclaimed the old man, “the white men are cheats! They put heavy pieces of iron under their scales to rob us; they put lumps of stuff in their measures to rob us; they give beads in short numbers to rob us; when we work for them they beat us just before our term is finished so that we may run away without our pay, and when we have carried loads for them they often pretend we have stolen from them so as to have an excuse for not paying us.” 

The old man had worked himself into a rage as he recalled wrong after wrong; but his voice was drowned in a burst of laughter that came from a group sitting round another fire. “What are you laughing at?” he shouted aggressively.
“Not at you, father,” respectfully answered one of the young men. “We are laughing at what we heard yesterday: A trader had treated his house boys, his people, and his customers very badly for some time, so some of them met together one evening, went to his house, and stripping him of his clothes, they carried him into the bush, and 16rubbed him well with cow-itch, and then let him go. He had a very bad time; but he has been better to his people since that night.”
There was much snapping of fingers and chuckling over this joke played on the white man.
“For what purpose does the white man buy rubber and ivory?” asked one of the boys of the old man with the plaited beard.
“I don’t know,” replied the old man. “When I was a boy we made pestles and trumpets of the ivory, and drumstick knobs with the rubber; but I think the white man only buys rubber and ivory to hide the real reason of his presence in our country.”
“What is that?” asked the lad.
“Well,” said the old man, with a knowing look in his black eyes, “the white man does not like the work of making cloth, hence they come to this country to buy up all the bodies of those who die to send to their country to make cloth for them. They preserve the bodies in their stores until there is a good opportunity of sending them away in their steamers; and when these bodies reach Mputu (the white man’s country) the spirits are forced to return to them by the magic of their great ‘medicine men,’ and then they are compelled to work for them as their slaves.

“The white men have very strong magic, surpassing 17the magic of our people; but if the white men were not here, very few, if any, of our people would die. Why, a friend of mine told me all about it the other day. He said: ‘In the sea there is a hole,[8] and the white man goes in his steamer to this hole and rings a bell, and the water sprites push up the end of a piece of cloth, and the white man pulls on it one day, two days, three days, until he has enough cloth, and then he cuts it off and measures it into pieces, and binds it into the bales, as we see in their stores. But before he leaves the hole he throws into it some bodies he has bought in our country.’ Yes, the white men are very wicked, and don’t you have anything to do with them. Why, all your relatives who have died are now, perhaps, slaves in Mputu, and some day you may be the same.”
A thrill of horror went through the gaping crowd as the old man in graphic language and with dramatic gestures told these things. When he had gained his breath he began again.
“The other day I heard of some exceedingly wicked white men who pretend to tell people about God, white men who will give you medicine if you ask for it, and will teach you in a school how to read and write, and will even take you into their houses and clothe and feed you. Beware of 18those white men, for they are only trying to secure you, and you will soon die and become their slaves in Mputu. The other white men say: ‘We have come for rubber and ivory,’ and we receive plenty of trade goods from them in return for our rubbish; but these very wicked ones say: ‘We have only come to tell you about the great God, and to help you.’ They are more crafty, cunning and wicked than the others. Keep away from them always, or you will quickly die!”
By the time the old man had finished there was a large circle of horror-stricken natives around him, who, with many a cry of rage and hatred against such evil doings, promised never to go near such wicked wretches as these white men were, and with many an oath they threatened they would kill them if ever they had the opportunity.

Just before arriving at the resting-place the head trader unfortunately struck his toes against a stone, and, being very superstitious, he was filled 20with horror at the evil omen 

 It was the general subject of conversation as to what this omen predicted. One thought that a wife of the head trader was dead; another suggested that his house and goods were destroyed by fire; and thus they prophesied one evil after another until Satu--the poor fellow who had struck his toes--could hardly rest at the midday halt; and he certainly put on a very woebegone appearance, for he had no doubt some great misfortune had befallen him or was about to happen to him. This fear so played on his mind that he had disturbed sleep and bad dreams that night; and often started out of a nightmare screaming that his sister or his wife was dead, or his house was burnt to the ground.
The next day a large town was reached, and Satu sought out the “medicine man” there, who was famous through all the countryside for the wonderful power of his fetish, and the charms he made from it. Satu told him how he had struck his toes against a stone, and his fear of the evil omen, and asked the wizard to avert the evil. Some of his companions laughed[9] at him for wasting his money over such nonsense, while others, who were more superstitious, advised him to fee the wizard well, and thus enlist his power to stave off the threatened mischief.
21This particular “medicine man” had a charm which was called Kimbaji-mbaji (meaning, to-morrow), and any person who came under its protection could not be harmed because he who wanted to hurt him always put off the carrying out of his evil intentions until to-morrow, and, as you know, to-morrow never comes. The special charm used by this wizard was a shell full of various herbs which had been pounded, mixed and rammed into it.

The troubled man took a fowl to the wizard, who killed it and poured some of its blood into the shell, which he then placed on the ground, surrounding it with eight little heaps of gunpowder. After dancing about them for a short time, and chanting an incantation over them, he exploded the powder and blew his whistle vigorously. These ceremonies aroused the charm to work effectively in the postponement of the evil spells that were being used against the man. The wizard received twenty brass rods as his fee; and Satu went on his journey satisfied that the omen could not now work against him.
Satu, however, found on his arrival home that the wizard’s power was ineffectual in his case, for his brother, the chief of the town, was very ill and nigh unto death. Hence their arrival, instead of being acclaimed with the loud shouting of women 22and children, and the firing of many guns, was greeted with the solemn headshakes of the men, the crying of the women, and the beating of drums by the “medicine men.”
The patient was apparently so bad that as a last resort they had called all the “medicine men” of the district together in the hope that their combined force would rescue the man from the malignant influence of the evil spirit--the ndoki that was killing him. All night long they had been drumming, shouting, beating gongs, and parading about the town calling on the evil spirit to desist, but without avail, for the chief was now dying, and Satu had only just arrived in time to receive his brother’s last wishes about his property and the names of those who owed him money, and slaves.
All the goods brought from the coast were piled in the chief’s house so that he might gloat with dying eyes on his increased wealth, and curse in strong, passionate language the ndoki who was causing his death.
From my fortunate spy-hole I could with ease view the weird scene. It was a small hut built of grass and sticks tied neatly and securely together. There were two doors, but no windows, and the smoke escaped as best it could through crevices in the walls and roof.

As the deceased chief was a very great man it was necessary to postpone his burial for a month or two until fitting arrangements for a grand funeral could be conveniently made, otherwise his spirit would not be satisfied, and trouble would follow.[10] Moreover, if the chief had been hurriedly buried like an ordinary man, the whole countryside would have accused the family of meanness and selfishness in wanting to keep the dead man’s wealth for themselves. Therefore the body was dried, wrapped in a cloth and placed in a hut built for the purpose. 

My new owner was a free-born lad of high spirits, alertness and agility, quick at all games, successful in all kinds of sports; but like many of his seniors, held the women and girls in great contempt except when he wanted a favour, and then he could cajole and flatter them until their eyes sparkled with pleasure and they became his 26slaves. He was, however, very superstitious, had many charms tied about his person, and regarded the “medicine men” with great awe and admiration. Bakula quite believed that his success in hunting, his smartness at games, and his general good fortune were entirely due to his charms and the regularity with which he made sacrifices to them.
The appointed day for the funeral was drawing nigh, so the preparations were pushed on apace. Large quantities of cassava flour[12] were prepared and an immense number of kwanga[13] loaves were bought at the different markets, and demijohns and calabashes of palm-wine were ordered for the three days’ feasting that were to precede the interment.

 The present was supposed to be in proportion to the giver’s social position. A chief who on account of his importance had received two goats with his invitation would be expected to give three times the value of the goats in cloth, and if he fell short of this he was considered mean; but if he went beyond it he was regarded as a generous, wealthy man, and his name would be in the mouths of all the mourners, and he could strut about puffed out with pride.
This cloth, though given ostensibly “to wind round the dead chief,” was really used to defray the expenses of the feast; and happy was the family which had no crushing debt left at the close of such festivities. Satu carefully noted the value of every gift, and although he could not write, yet at the close of the day he could have told from his well-trained memory the number and quality of every piece of cloth given by any chief.

The guests broke up into groups of from six to ten persons; and each group received a large vessel of smoking vegetables, and another of steaming meat and gravy.
At once the fingers were dipped in, and he who could bolt his food the quickest got the largest share of what was going.[14] Vessel after vessel was 30emptied, and stomachs visibly distended in the process; but at last operations became slower and died away in grunts of satisfaction.
I noticed that the men and boys ate by themselves, and the women and girls by themselves. In fact, it was considered beneath his dignity for a man to eat with a woman; and boys of ten would receive their portion from their mothers and go and eat it with the men. As a rule the women had what was left by the men, or what they could successfully hide from them. During meals little or nothing was said, as each diner thought eating was more important than talking.

 In a court of fowls the cockroach never wins his case; i. e. the verdict of one race against another is to be received with caution. 

. In the open air they held their receptions, their social meetings, their palavers, their courts of justice, and every other town and domestic function. The houses were simply for sleeping, for storing their goods, and for sitting in on cold, windy, stormy days. There was no privacy about the native manner of living, but everybody knew everything about everybody else, and a little more besides. 

A great number of charms and fetishes were to be found in the town, and it seemed as though they had a charm for every imaginable circumstance of life. One man possessed a charm to protect his goods, and another had a charm to help him steal successfully; one owned a charm to bring him good luck in trading, and another wore a charm to aid him in cheating on the markets the folk with whom he traded. One man whom I saw had a charm to render him invisible that he might, unseen, hear conversations, and enter forbidden places to his own advantage; and many had bought charms to keep evil spirits from jumping down their throats. 

What is that?It’s a charm to guard me from lies.
Oh thats interesting. Mandri has a charm to aid him in lying.
I do not!

My owner, Bakula, wore many charms about his person. One maintained him in good health, 36another helped him in hunting, a third made him a favourite with the women and girls, and a fourth brought him good luck in his trading transactions with the other folk in the town. On the appearance of every new moon, Bakula would at sunset catch a chicken, and, cutting its toe, drop a little blood on each of his charms to keep them in good humour, or otherwise they would not act on his behalf. 

“Here is a little fowl trying to lay a big egg.” Such was the effect of this proverb that the pompous man collapsed, whilst his audience chuckled and shook their sides with laughter. And amid the laughter Bakula ran off, and we soon joined a group of young folk who were telling stories round the fire. 
At the close of this story there were many comments on the ’cuteness of the sparrow, and some sage remarks. One little fellow said that, although the sparrow was small, she had more wit and sense than either the big crocodile or the bigger elephant. Therefore we should not despise people because they are small.
They begged Bakula to tell them another story; but he said he could not remember another just then. They, however, pleaded with him, and at 43last he said: “If Tumbu will now tell one of his stories, I will try and recall one of mine by the time he has finished.” Tumbu, who was sitting at the back, was pushed forward to a place in the centre, near the fire; and as the light from the fire fell on him, it revealed a sad face lit with large, intelligent, but pathetic, eyes.

When this story ended appreciative remarks were made on the wit of the squirrel, and contempt was poured on the clumsy leopard who so 48foolishly threw away the verdict given in his favour. 

uring the illness of the deceased chief there was a widespread feeling in the town that some one was bewitching him, and that therefore the “medicine men” were unable to cure him. At last one of their wizards stated plainly that a witch was at work destroying their best efforts; and although they tried charms to ward off, and threats to frighten, the witch from pursuing his (or her) wicked purpose, yet their patient continued to grow worse, and at last died. And now that their chief was buried the people demanded that a proper witch-finder should be engaged to seek out the witch. 


A great witch-finder was called from a distant town, and on his arrival I noticed that he was a small, active man with keen piercing eyes that seemed to jump from face to face and read the very thoughts of those who stood around. 

He was dressed in the soft skins of monkeys and bush-cats; around his neck was a necklace of rats’ teeth mixed with the teeth of crocodiles and leopards. His body was decorated with pigments of different colours; thick circles of white surrounded the eyes, a patch of red ran across the forehead, broad stripes of yellow chased each other down the cheeks, bands of red and yellow went up the arms and across the chest, and spots of blue promiscuously filled in the vacant spaces. At the different points of his curious dress were bells that tinkled at every movement. The boys looked at him in deep awe, the girls and women cowered away from him, and the men, though they feared him, greeted him with a simulated friendliness that ill-accorded with their nervousness.
The witch-finder (or N gang’ a N gombo) was supposed to find his own way to the town and home of his client; for how could they believe in a man’s occult power to discover a witch if he had not the ability to walk straight, without being shown, to the house of his employer.

To meet this difficulty the witch-finder had one or two apprentices, among whose duties it was to question cautiously the messenger, and to obtain from him all the needed information about the town, house, circumstances attending the death of 51the person, and the relations of the townspeople to one another. If the messenger would not, or could not, give the required knowledge, then the assistant accompanied him back to his town, and, as he went, he dropped at the cross-roads twigs or leaves to guide his master--the witch-finder--right up to the house of his client.
The assistant ferreted out the quarrels of the family employing his master, and their animosities towards each other, or towards one of their number. In every family there is to be found at least one who is the object of the suspicion, jealousy or hatred of the family--the unpopular member; and all the information thus gathered is secretly told to the witch-finder and the disliked person pointed out to him.

Presently he elicited the fact that the deceased had had a very bad quarrel with some one, and then he discovered that it was with a man in the town. By crafty questions the witch-doctor narrowed the circle of examination, the people, all excitement, really helping him though quite unaware that they did so; and at last, in a fandango of whirling skins and rotating arms and legs, he brought himself to a standstill in front of one of the men, and accused him of being the person who had bewitched the late chief to death.
It was the unpopular man, Satu’s brother, who was thus publicly declared the witch, and the whole crowd was astonished that they had never thought of him before as the monster who used witchcraft to do his own brother to death.
Immediately on the declaration there was a tremendous hubbub of voices; insults were heaped on the accused, he was jostled about, weapons were raised threateningly, and each tried to outvie his neighbour in abusing the denounced man as a proof of his own guiltlessness.
Amidst the mêlée the accused protested his own innocence, and demanding to take the ordeal, 53he ran for his gun[20] to shoot the witch-finder who had, by his false accusation, brought all this trouble on him. But the crafty nganga had received his large fee, and was already well on his way back to his own town. None doubted the bona fides of the nganga except Mavakala, the accused man; and how could he prove his guiltlessness except by voluntarily taking the ordeal.

What had Mavakala done to draw such an accusation upon himself? On his brother’s death he had cried as long and as loudly as any of them; he had neglected his person, worn old clothes, dressed his hair in mourning fashion, gone unwashed, and had carefully observed all the usual ceremonies of “crying” for a near relative, and yet they charged him with bewitching his brother to death. Yes, all his neighbours recalled these facts, but they interpreted them now in the light of this serious charge. Of course, he had observed all these rites simply to deceive them. He must have thought them fools to be duped by his proofs and protestations. No, he must take the ordeal, and that quickly, and the ordeal-giver must be sent for immediately. The whole of Mavakala’s family was alienated from him, for was he not accused of the most heinous crime of which a human being can be guilty--witchcraft?
54What had Mavakala done to render himself so fatally unpopular? That evening the declaration of the witch-finder was discussed round all the fires, and as Bakula went from group to group I picked up many items of the indictment.
Mavakala was an energetic, successful trader, and from each trading journey he came back the richer for his enterprise. They were jealous of his wealth; but among themselves they whispered that his increased riches were really due to witchcraft and not to his ability; and were not their suspicions justified, for was he not now accused of selling his brother’s corpse to the white traders?
I heard, too, that Mavakala was a skilled blacksmith, and had made good knives out of odd pieces of hoop iron taken from old cases, and bought, by him, from traders on the river; and had even made hoes and axes out of old bale iron. Many other clever things he had done, all of which were now by these superstitious people accepted as proofs of his witchcraft. He had awakened their jealousy by his energy and smartness in business; his skill and ingenuity in smithing had aroused their suspicions, and his prosperity had provoked their hatred. In any other country his ability would have been admired and honoured, but on the Congo it was a sign of witchcraft, and always ended in death by the ordeal.
55It was then I understood the reason for the backwardness of these people. They destroy their leaders and their best men, and the only hope of the people is deliverance from the curse of the witch-doctors.
The next day the ordeal-giver (or ngol’a nkasa) arrived, bringing with him the ordeal bark which he had procured from the nkasa tree in the following manner. This tree is supposed to have a spirit; hence, when they are about to cut some of its bark for ordeal purposes, they address it in these words: “I come to take a piece of your bark, and if the man for whom it is intended is a witch, let my machet bend when I strike you; but if he is not a witch, let my machet enter into you, and let the wind stop blowing.” The machet had bent under the blow, and the omen being against Mavakala the ordeal-giver made his preparations with smug satisfaction.
Mavakala, accompanied by many of the men and lads of the town, was led to the bare top of a neighbouring hill, where a rough shanty of palm fronds was built. The accused was pushed into this, and told to stretch out his arms, and not to touch anything. The ordeal-giver pushed a stone towards the poor wretch, with twenty-seven pieces of nkasa bark on it; and then he ground each 56piece of bark and slowly fed Mavakala with the powders.

Unsuccessful people hate success.

Consequently, when the ordeal-giver proposed that further tests should be applied, there were none to lift up their voices in protest against the injustice of continuing the cruelty.
Mavakala was dazed with the narcotic effects of the drug that had been forced on him, and his wits were dulled and muddled. He was taken with rough hands from the temporary hut and made to stand by himself, a swaying, lonely, pathetic figure--a type of all those who have been persecuted or have laid down their lives for the sole crime of being in the vanguard of their generation.
While Mavakala stood swaying there, six twigs in rapid succession were thrown at his feet, and he as quickly had to name the trees to which they belonged. This he did successfully, and then he was told to name the birds and butterflies that were sailing by. Again he unerringly gave each its proper name; but now, just when he wanted his 57eyes to be at their keenest, he could feel them becoming blurred with the dregs of the drug he had been forced to take. His tormentors called on him to name the ants crawling at his feet. He faltered, stammered confusedly, and in stooping, that his poor, hazy eyes might have a better chance to recognize them, he fell, with a moaning cry, to the ground.
In an instant the heartless, superstitious crowd was on him; sticks and machets, knives and guns, soon did their work on the poor mangled body. None was too poor or mean to kick his carcass and spit in his face, and his bruised, gory corpse was left unburied upon the bare hill-top--a feast for the beasts of the forests and the birds of the air.
By and by the stars peeped out, half ashamed to look on a world where such tragedies were enacted, and as they looked they saw that thing there upon the bare hill-top. It was covered with wounds, and every wound had a tongue that cried to its God, and to their God: “How long, how long, shall darkness cover the land, and gross darkness the people?”

Ch.9 (70)

His wives and followers at first refused to return with him; but the old man, infuriated at their unwillingness, poured upon them a torrent of abuse, charged them with bewitching him to kick the stone, and threatened them with the curses of his various fetishes in such invectives that they trembled before him, and, gathering their goods, followed him with hearts full of fear and hate.
We lost so much time over these events that instead of reaching our destination that evening we were compelled to spend another night on the road. The whole of the next morning was leisurely spent in resting and dressing.

KING LEOPOLD’S SOLILOQUYA DEFENSE OF HIS CONGO RULE

TWAIN

[Throws down pamphlets which he has been reading. Excitedly combs his flowing spread of whiskers with his fingers; pounds the table with his fists; lets off brisk volleys of unsanctified language at brief intervals, repentantly drooping his head, between volleys, and kissing the Louis XI crucifix hanging from his neck, accompanying the kisses with mumbled apologies; presently rises, flushed and perspiring, and walks the floor, gesticulating] 
These generosities are studiedly ignored, in print. In print I get nothing but slanders—and slanders again—and still slanders, and slanders on top of slanders! Grant them true, what of it? They are slanders all the same, when uttered against a king. 


mouth full of Bible and my pelt oozing piety at every pore, and implored them to place the vast and rich and populous Congo Free State in trust in my hands as their agent, so that I might root out slavery and stop the slave raids, and lift up those twenty-five millions of gentle and harmless blacks out of darkness into light, the light of our blessed Redeemer, the light that streams from his holy Word, the light that makes glorious our noble civilization—lift them up and dry their tears and fill their bruised hearts with joy and gratitude—lift them up and make them comprehend that they were no longer outcasts and forsaken, but our very brothers in Christ; how America and thirteen great European states wept in sympathy with me, and were persuaded; 

Oh, well, let them blackguard me if they like; it is a deep satisfaction to me to remember that I was a shade too smart for that nation that thinks itself so smart.

That over there is chopper.
Chop!?
No! No chop. No chop.
Aw.
Don’t say the word chop around chopper. Unless you need something chopped. And if you need something chopped you better find him and let him do it or else he’ll get all fussy.

Not many of us left since yesterday.

The man walking in front of Mandri, the short and stout man who was carrying the ‘unconscious’ Mazyd Oro, his name was Hill. The rude, scraggly man walking behind Mandri, the one with the torch, his name was Bib, and according to Bib, these were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don’t bother with ‘why’, or ‘what is going on’, or ‘I can’t see where I’m going’, no, the only thing that mattered was that Hill was in front and Bib was behind and that was the way things were going to be - so stop talking. “Don’t make a peep”, Bib commanded. If Mandri did so much as breathe too loud for Bib’s comfort, well that was sufficient cause for an open handed smack on the back of the head.
Sound carried in that pitch-black tunnel so the going was hard for Mandri. All the while he was stifling groans because his once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods. They were so sore that it felt like his thigh muscles would rupture every time he bent his knees. Instead of striding through the dark like Bib wanted him to, Mandri shuffled through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor. That was hard to do because the tunnel was a dumping ground. There was a horde of trash piled all the way up the low ceiling, and though there was a narrow path through it, it was not a place for unshod feet. Scattered in the sand were picked-clean bones of small animals, splintered balkanut shells the size of skulls, curved clay shards of shattered jars, and all manner of organic waste, the worst of which were the cold and gooey lumps of muck that glistened when they welled up in between Mandri’s toes - Mandri wasn’t sure it was shit until Hill stepped in it, too.
“Godsdamned it! Bib, was this you?” Hill was pointing down at dark stain on the bottom of his hard leather boot.
“Course not,” Bib protested.
“Why can’t you shit in the hole like everyone else?” Hill asked.
“It wasn’t me!”
“It’s always you.”
“It’s always Grungy.”
Hill gave a frustrated sigh and said, “It’s always either you or Grungy, and Grungy’s dead, so that leaves you.”
“It wasn’t me.”
Hill glared over Mandri’s shoulder at the defiant Bib.
Bib shot right back, “And who’s the one putting all this trash in here, huh? You know there’s a pit for all this, too, but you’re too lazy, ain’t ya? Everyone is. You wanna take it out me? No. Get yourself together fore you come and pick on my habits.” 
Hill snorted and turned back towards the darkness and readjusted Oro’s dead weight on his shoulders. Then he set off once again, dragging his right foot in the dirt as he went so as to scrape the shit off it.
This tunnel was the most loathsome place that Mandri had ever been, but that didn’t mean it was the Underworld. On the surface it all fit, the grime, the stifling stench, the cramped quarters, the fact that there wasn’t one thing in this tunnel that was whole, yet with each step Mandri was becoming more and more certain that this wasn’t the Underworld. There was a semblance of organization with the way all the junk was pushed up against the walls to make a path, and that made it feel lived-in. When the trio left this narrow tunnel and came out into a larger one with a swept floor and high ceiling and clean  air, Mandri was sure - this was the regular old world. There’d be no dedicated trash pit in the Underworld. Either every surface would be covered in slop and refuse as an indictment of the waste of nations, or there’d be no trash at all because as disgusting as it is, trash is a sign of plenty.
No, Mandri was convinced, this was not the Underworld.
Did that mean that Mazyd Oro had been telling the whole truth? Mandri wasn’t convinced of that. He wasn’t ready to believe that Oro was a Mazydai. A Mazydai was a being of storied power, yet there Oro was, a meter ahead, all limp and cut-up and shoulder-slung like a sty-pig at a wet market. The torchlight would catch his pale skin, and his back was all torn up by whipping. Hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazydai down so low. It certainly wasn’t these two tawdry bandits that did it. Hill and Bib were as unimposing as sandland folk come, dirty and hungry looking, the kind of folk you feared because they were repulsive, not because they were fearsome.
Mandri snuck a look behind at Bib. Bib had his pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.
Bib sneered and shouted, “Get going!”
He kicked out at Mandri’s heels, as if that would help Mandri shuffle along faster.
Outside of the fact that an objective universe exists independent of his own mind, the only thing Mandri was completely sure of was that these two people had a leader, and that this leader had the strength to bring low a Mazydai and even conquer death. Whoever that person was, it was a man worth meeting. So Mandri steeled himself against the pain in his legs, rubbed his foot in the dirt to wipe the shit off it, and then did his best to keep up with Hill who was finding his way through the dark like he’d placed each shattered piece of pot himself. 
Eventually the going got smoother and the tunnel got even wider and it looked more like an outlaw hideaway. On each side there was a store of chopped lumber and then there were half-empty bags of grain. On from there they came to a kind of barracks -  flat surface was crowded with empty cots and  , even charcoal markings on the walls, Then this dark passage emptied out into a bigger one, where the ceiling was twice Mandri’s height. At the end of this larger tunnel, some fifty meters away, the tunnel gave way to the blinding light of day. Mandri’s eyes were so accustomed to the dark that one quick glance at this spot of sunlight was enough to imprint a white circle into his retina, so that no matter where he looked, there it was, a white blot obscuring everything.
Mandri stopped in his tracks out of instinct and tried to blink out the blindness. This sudden stop caused Bib to bump into Mandri’s back, and for Bib, that was unacceptable.
“Whore’s breath, boy! You’re a pokey ole tacko, ain’t ya?!”
Bib gave Mandri a hard shove that sent Mandri sprawling right into Hill’s legs, sending them both tumbling to the ground. Mazyd Oro, who’d been content to ride Hill’s shoulder, had his unconscious ruse upset by the sudden lurch. He yelped and went tumbling along with the others, splaying his elbows out to brace his fall, careful to keep his bandages out of the dirt.
Hill waddled back to his feet and then turned towards Bib and said in the most matter-of-fact tone, “Bib, you are a got-damned idiot.”
Bib brandished the torch towards him in a state of alarm. “Hill! He’s awake! The Mazyd’s awake!”
Hill looked down and there at his feet was Mandri grimacing, clutching his wrist against his stomach as he’d jammed it against an up-jut of rock. 
Mazyd Oro wasn’t there.
Hill spun around towards the entrance, expecting to see, but no one was there.
Then he heard a thud from behind and Bib give a yelp.
When Hill spun back around he caught a glimpse of a naked, pale figure sprinting into the black depths of the cave with exceptional agility, leaping from rock to rock.
“Aw, Shit!” Hill exclaimed. “Shit! Shit! Shit!”
Hill drew a short sword that was hidden under his cloak and his took off into the darkness after Oro, shouting orders to Bib as he went. “Stay here and go get Ayram!”
Bib stood and stared in disbelief into the darkness. When his wits returned to him, he turned around and took off towards the cave exit. He got halfway when his wits fully returned to him. He sprinted back towards Mandri and ordered him to get up in a tone that was as serious as it was urgent, but Mandri did not move.
“I said, get up!”
“Piss off!” Mandri retorted through clenched teeth. 
Bib let out a little roar of frustration, then reached down and grabbed Mandri by the collar and lifted him up.
Mandri, still half-blind and stumbling, tried to shrug off Bib’s grip.
“I said piss off!”
Bib swung the torch round to Mandri’s face so close that it nearly singed his eyebrows.
“Say one more word and I’ll shove this thing down your throat.”
Mandri let himself be pulled, half blind and stumbling, out into the sun. When they got there, Bib let go and Mandri collapsed and let the warmth wash over him. The orange sand swallowing his knees was hot but comfortably so, like . He dug his hands into it. Mandri wanted to dive into it like a horse-backed lizard.
Bib shouted, “Ayram!”
Mandri looked up and squinted at the blob of shadow out in front of him. 
After a moment of trying to parse the blob of light and shadow in front of him, Mandri realized that he wasn’t quite out of the cave yet, for the tunnel ‘exit’ was more of an entrance into the bottom of a fat cylindrical pit. All around there were walls of sheer vertical limestone rising up a good thirty feet to encircle a pit of orange sand. The sun’s light angled down the sides of this colossal white limestone bucket, leaving half the pit in cold shadow, and half in a dusty, radiant glow.
Bib was shielding his eyes, looking for someone hidden in the cool shadows of the other side of the pit. Mandri saw a few dark and lumpy shapes against the limestone and assumed they were people, but he couldn’t quite make them out.
Bib shouted for his leader.
“Ayram!”
One of the shadows spoke up and said, “He’s not here.” 
“Where in the hell is he?”
“He’s in the cloister with Elrahet.”
Bib dashed back into the darkness of the tunnel, leaving Mandri in the sun alone, spotlighted against the sand.
Mandri squinted into the shadow of the pit and was struck dumb by the glare of strangers descending upon him. 
An attractive Zosan woman stepped into the light. Her smooth, dark face was framed by a white linen scarf that was loosely wrapped around her head and neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige burnoose. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of life out in the Sand, the lady wore it with a hint of regal bearing - she held her shoulders in a kind of self-important sweep that showed she knew how to stand; amongst those obsessed with refinement, even standing is an art. 
Her voice was almost as imperious as her uncompromising stare. 
“You’re the dead boy,” she said. 
Yes, Mandri was the dead boy. It was such a simple matter of fact, but the way she said it made it seem like it was some keen insight that was obvious only to her. 
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. He was anxious not to appear too ruffled. He narrowed his eyes and sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it when he saw the woman smirk.
“I am Moteah,” she said with the same degree of , like this, too, was a revelation. She wrinkled her nose as she looked down on Mandri. Apparently she could smell the death on him. Then she made a show of shaking some thought out of her head, and said, “That man who brought you out here-”
“Bib?”
“Yes. Bib. Do you know why he was so hasty?”
Mandri smiled. “Your other prisoner escaped.”
“The Mazydai escaped?”
“Yes.”
The word was hardly out of Mandri’s mouth when three scraggly men, all wrapped up in deep desert fashion, leapt up out of the shadows and sprinted across the sand towards Mandri. In three strides they brushed right past him, and on the fourth they disappeared into the dark tunnel, leaving cloud of dust swirling in the entrance behind them.
Moteah held her arms up before anyone else could follow. The loose sleeves of her burnoose 
“No one else!” she shouted. “The Mazyd has nowhere to go. Ayram and the others will deal with it.”
All the while her eyes were fixed on Mandri.
Mandri is like, fuck.
“On the off chance you that aren’t a living curse, I’d like to extend you the courtesy of welcome.”
Moteah took a half-step back, bowed at the waist, and flourished her arm in Mandri’s general direction. 
A few chuckles chorused out of the pit’s shadow.
“You will have to forgive my fellow Ayramun for not receiving you warmly,” Moteah said. “After all, you are a harbinger of death.”
“A what?” Mandri asked.
Moteah waved Mandri’s confusion away and turned towards the shadowed side of the pit to address her fellow Ayramun. Her voice rang out louder now so that everyone was sure to hear. “There’s no reason to treat this one here any differently than any other.” 
A rattled old voice shouted out, “At least not till Ayram has sussed him out!”
“So show him respect until-”
A grumbling voice shot of out of the dark. “Show him a dog’s dick, I will!”
“Not till Ayram has sussed him out, you won’t!”
She looked up to the rim of the pit and shouted, “Did you hear that, Sonny?”
A disappointed voice echoed down.
“Yeah, yeah.”
Moteah puffed herself up and said, “I shouldn’t have to say this to you all, but thing’s being what they are… No one gives anyone else any shit unless Ayram says so. That includes this boy.”
She gestured wide towards Mandri. A few unconvinced grunts followed.
“Now,” Moteah said, continuing to address the shadows, “Who has Papi’s clothes?”
No one answered.
Moteah stamped her foot. “The boy needs wrapping before we set out and Papi’s clothes will fit. So, who took them?”
“For pity’s sake, woman. Papi’s been not been dead two days.”
“Where Papi is now, do you think he cares what happens to his clothes?”
“I care.”
“Did you take his clothes, then, Pelt?”
“No. Sob did.”
Moteah head turned to the right. “Sob? Do you have Papi’s clothes?”
No one answered.
Moteah turned towards Mandri and motioned for him to follow her into the shade, and so he did.
 Tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit’s crescent shadow was a burly man stretched out amongst a couple burlap sacks. This man’s head was little more than a wiry bush of black, for between the beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a blotch of skin anywhere. There was a mouth in there somewhere, because sticking out of it was a smoking pipe of freeweed. 
The man was propped up on one elbow. He took one look at Mandri and said, “The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care. I won’t get sick of the whimpering.”
Moteah introduced Mandri to this irascible bush of a man with a sigh. “This is Sob,” she said.
Sob grunted.
“Sob is an idiot,” Moteah said.
“Come off it,” Sob moaned.
“Are those Papi’s clothes?” she asked as she pointed to the bundle of clothes against which Sob was leaning.
Sob patted the bundle with care and said. “They are. Make a nice pillow, don’t they. I’ll give ‘em to the boy, but not ‘til Ayram commands it.”
“Give them here,” Moteah said, undeterred. 
“Woman. What did I just say?”
“You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn’t ready to go when he gets out here?”


“Fine! Alright.” he moaned. “Should have led with that.” 
“I shouldn’t have to lead with anything. You should just do what I tell you to do.”
Sob sat up and made to undo the string wrapping the bundle of clothes under neath him, grumbling as he did it. “You know, last I checked this was the Ayramun.”
“What’s your point.”
Sob gave up trying to undo a troublesome knot. He tossed the wrapped bundle of clothes at Mandri’s feet and said, “Go on. But you need be remembering whose clothes those really belong.”
“I’ve heard,” Mandri said. “They’re Papi’s.”
“No.” Sob scowled. “They’re Ayram’s.”
Mandri looked from Sob to Moteah in confusion.
“They’re not Ayram’s, Ayram’s,” Sob said. “What I mean is that everything’s Ayram’s ‘ere. Clothes on me back. Them clothes there at your feet. The food that’s comin to your belly. It’s all loaned out, if you like. We’re the Ayramun. Everything’s Ayram’s. Not yours, and not Moteah’s either. Don’t go lettin her on about that. But go on.”
Mandri picked up the bundle. He pulled at the plaited hemp string and unrolled the clothes onto the ground. He picked out a few items that looked comfortable. There was a thick white linen tunic that was crumpled with salt and sweat, and some brown leather pants with a black stripe sewn down the sides. There was also a pair of rawhide shoes that, when he put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the shirt had a blood stain around the collar and the the sleeves were a little ragged at the wrists. Mandri didn’t complain though.
When finally had it all on, Sob looked him up and down with a peculiar stare and said, “That’s what Papi wore when he got killt.”
Mandri felt a chill run through his bones.
Sob started grabbing up the clothes the clothes 
“I thought you said they were Ayram’s.”

Sob nodded. “Like Moteah said, the Lad’s dead. He don’t want em.” He pointed to Mandri’s shirt and his lips spread into another warped smile. 
“I don’t know. I don’t know if I’m comfortable wearing this.”
Sob stopped what he was doing to stare at Moteah and say, “Ain’t ya comfortable, though?” 
Moteah rolled her eyes and said, “You’ll be fine.”
“I don’t know. It seems, uh, it seems a bit rude to be wearing these.”
“Ain’t it, though?”
Moteah reassured him. “It’s fine.”
Mandri looked down at the bloodstained sleeves. He wondered if this was some kind of joke. “I don’t suppose you’ve got anything else I could wear?” he asked.
“There’s nothing wrong with those,” Moteah said.
“Hell of a lot wrong with those.” Sob said. Mandri was looking at him all concerned so Sob clarified. “Those clothes have got to be threaded with the worst luck imaginable, don’t they?”
“Don’t get started,” Moteah said.
“Ain’t not matter about startin’, cause as far as them clothes are concerned, well, Papi was wearin’ ‘em, weren’t he?”
Moteah groaned and 
Sob looked towards Mandri and whispered like Moteah wasn’t standing right there and could hear. “This woman don’t know about luck.”
Another Ayramun, a thin, wiry woman sitting nearby, piped up. “That cause she ain’t got any luck.”
“Wrong!” Sob said, clearly sore about being interrupted. “There’s no such thing as ‘no luck’. There’s only good luck and bad luck. No luck at all is just bad luck.”
Moteah rolled her eyes and said, voice thick with derision, “Sob knows all about luck, don’t you Sob.”
“Damn right I do,” Sob said.
Sob reached down into a leather pack at his side and took from it a round pouch the size of his fist. He loosed the string the kept it closed and revealed to Mandri an assortment of rocks and pebbles. “Alright, take one o’ me rocks. As token of respect.”
The wiry woman nearby was. She was looking all surprised.
“These are lucky rocks, boy. Count yourself blessed.”
“Only small measures of luck,” Sob corrected. “Won’t balance out them clothes, but it’s a step.”
“They’re lucky rocks?” Mandri asked as he looked over the stones with a skeptical eye.
“Of course!” The fact that Mandri was expressing doubt seemed offensive to him, and so Sob drew out his frustration with a sneer. “They’ve been tested. And if I say they’ve been tested, they’ve been tested.”
“Tested how?”
Sob threw up his hands. “You dumb?”
“No.”
“How do you test anything? You pick it up, try to do somethin’ with it, then see what happens. If it works, good chance the thing is lucky. If it works ten times over, then its been tested, ain’t it?”
“I guess.”
“I keep the real unlucky rocks, too,” Sob continued. “They’re not as good as a curse pot, but if someone gets to pesterin’ you, and you think they need a spot of bad-luck, slip a bad-luck pebble into their pocket. They’re good for that. Little stones of retribution. I keep mine separate.” Sob then took another pouch from out of his things, and opened it to reveal another bunch of rocks. Each of these had a white ‘X’ carved into them. Sob picked one of them up and smiled at Moteah while he thumbed it’s grooves.
“Ever seen one of these babies, Moteah?” he asked.
She didn’t say anything back.
Mandri, eager to cut through the hostility that was shaping up between the two, decided to distract the hostilities with a question. He didn’t have to put much effort into pretending to care about the answer, because this was a tactic he’d learned from his mother while even in the womb. “The thing I don’t understand is, how does it all work?”
“What do you mean?” Sob asked.
“How does luck move from a thing to a person? You talk about luck ‘balancing out’, so does luck rub off like dust, or is it some kind of ‘aura’ which accounts for all the things on a person, or what?”
“Don’t get him started,” Moteah said, but Mandri’s question had hooked Sob with ease. The poor man jumped right into his theory of luck.
“It’s a bit strange, isn’t it,” Sob said. “You could certainly think of it like luck rubbing off. But I suppose more like a flow of energy. But there’s mechanics to it. There’s little quirks you got to learn by experience. You may wonder why I was restin’ my head on Papi’s clothes, considerin’ they’re unlucky. See, when your sleepin’, unlucky things will drain the un-luck out of ye, and good luck things will drain the good luck out of you. But that’s only when you’re sleepin’. ‘Cause when we’re sleeping we become inanimate things, subject to natural laws. Like how if you’re awake in a river you sink, but if you sleep you float like log.”
“Is that how that works?” Mandri wondered aloud.
“You ever try swimming while sleeping?”
“I suppose not.”
“When we’re awake and moving about and decidin’ things, it’s the normal mechanics of luck. But like I say, there’s quirks to it.”
“What are the normal mechanics of luck?”
“You know - luck. You know how luck works.”
“I don’t.”
“You don’t know… well you are a young fella…”
Moteah snorted. “He’s putting you on, Sob,” she said. “Nobody cares about this.”
“I am not,” Mandri said. “I want to know how luck works. I mean my life’s been shit, and maybe that’s because I’ve not been paying attention to this kind of thing. If there’s mechanics to luck, it’s worth hearing about.”
Moteah was stunned. “Look at him,” she said, pointing to Sob. “Sob’s the unluckiest bastard I’ve ever met. Look at his face. Oh, he doesn’t mind. He knows he’s ugly as hell. Guess how he got those scars.”
“I don’t know.”
“The man was swallowed by an king Kedrakeen.”
“But I survived! Who you know that survived the stomach of a full-grown Kedrakeen? Who you ever hear about do it? No one. None but me because I’m lucky.”
“Lucky to have survived? Sure. Unlucky as hell to ever get swallowed in the first place.”
Mandri was a little stunned by Moteah’s bluntness, but Sob wasn’t. Neither was he offended. His face was alight with relish, his smile was the wry smile of a man whose combantant had just set him up with the perfect stage to make a point.
“But that’s just the thing!” he said, left eye wide with excitement. “You need some unluck to really know about luck. It’s the always-lucky that don’t know a thing about luck because they don’t need to! They putter around, never steppin’ in any holes, and so they think that holes don’t exist! Never trust a lucky man’s ways. But someone like me, I’ve stepped in all the holes, I know my way around them by now. I’ve got Luck mapped as well as anybody whose ever lived.”
“There’s no real thing as luck,” Moteah countered. “And if there is, you certainly don’t know about it.”
Sob turned to Mandri to plead his case. “Son, if I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?”
Mandri knew that Sob was fishing for answer, so he gave it. “It’s luck.”
Moteah interjected. “Luck has nothing to do with it. It’s skill.”
“It’s luck!” Sob retorted. “Skill says whether or not you hit the target. Aim at the neck, and if you’re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it hits a vein or the meat of the muscle.”
Moteah groaned. “No one walks away from a shot in the neck,” she said.
“What do you call this, then?” Sob replied. He pulled at his collar to reveal a long white scar that wrapped round the left side of his neck. “Arrow that did this was shot from just twenty paces. Right through the neck. A mercenary from the Isle of Screte, no less; as skilled as any Aryamun with a bow. But his arrow as unlucky. The sum of the luck between the wood, the feathers, the glue, the string, the arrowhead, the archer, it wasn’t enough to beat me. And half my luck is these stones. I’d wager more than money that my stones is what saved me. Like Moteah says, my natural luck is shit. It’s cause of these stones that I’m talking to you know.”
“Alright then,” Moteah said. “Let’s make a bet. Let me ‘test’ one of your lucky stones’”
“You know I don’t bet,” Sob said.
“But you just said -”,
“It’s not morally right for me to be takin’ advantage of others in matters of luck. But enough talk,” Sob said, eager to move on before Moteah could press the issue. “Go on, Mandri, take one o’ my stones and see for yourself.” 
“Actually I was thinking that I want to get some experience myself.” Mandri said. “Like you say, learn the quirks. I think I’ll just pick up a stone off the ground, then test it, like you say.”
Sob’s face lit up. At least, the left side of it did. “That’s good! That’s the spirit!” Between his exlamations, Sob’s nose wiggled and WRM.
Mandri stepped over to the cave wall and pulled a little black shard of rock from it. He chose that particular piece because it stood out from the red sandstone. He thought it was a piece of jet, but it was quite rough to the touch, didn’t catch the light the same way, and it was shaped like a short, fat, carrot, fitting quite comfortably in his palm. 
“Odd choice.” Sob said. “I go for smaller, rounder stones. Easier to accumulate. But before you get to testin’, you need to be makin’ sure your luck is balanced out as best can be. How’s your natural luck? Naked as you came, how unlucky are you?”
“I’d say I’m pretty unlucky.”
“Are you cursed?”
“How would I know?”
Sob shrugged. “You should find that out, no? But Hill’s cloak is strong, I’ve seen it in action. It should keep you nice and balanced. Keep in mind, though, it takes time to get a feel fer these kind o’ things. You shouldn’t be expectin’ quick results.”
Mandri stuffed his new stone into his pocket. Then he pointed at Sob’s pouch of rocks. “What if Ayram wanted those?” he asked.
Sob cocked his ear. “What?”
“Well, they’re not your rocks, right? They’re Ayram’s. You said everything was Ayram’s.”
“What do you mean?”
“You said that everything was Ayram’s,” Mandri repeated. “ You said that everything is ‘loaned out’. That includes your lucky rocks, right?”
Sob glared at Mandri.
“Now why would you want to know about that?” he asked.
“I was just wondering. You said that -”
“Now hold on. I want to know what you’re on my lucky rocks for?”
“I was just wondering -”
“Don’t be out here wondering,” Sob said, cutting Mandri short. “Wondering about other people and what they’ve got will get you into trouble. So you just worry bout your rocks and I’ll worry bout mine.”
“I warned you not to get him started,” Moteah muttered.
“Get me started?” Sob said in mock offense. “I’m not started. I’m just tryin to keep the boy focused on what’s he needs to be focused on, and that’s his own damned luck.”
“Alright, alright,” Mandri said, trying to calm Sob down. “What should I do then? How should I test my new rock?”
“What do you want to do?”
Mandri thought for a moment. “Well,” he said, “I’d like to get up and out of this cave.”
“That’s not how it works,” Sob said. “You don’t wish-upon-a-stone. You’ve got to use the stone to do somethin’ like -”

            <Title>Windswept</Title>
            <Text>Its beginning was hidden, even secretive, and could only be seen in rueful hindsight.

DARFUR IS ON THE SOUTHEASTERN FRINGES OF THE ENDLESS EMPTINESS OF THE SAHARA, and its soil , beaten down from too many cattle and too many gats over too manyyears of drought, couldn’t hold the water. It pooled and then gathered in little muddy torrents that swept away the scattered huts of the countryside. A few days before the refugees in their grim camps had been dying of thirst, an ostrich egg of water having to do for a family for a whole day, but were were now forced to scramble to keep their pathetic scraps of food and their meager possessions from washing away. They were still starving, though now sodden and burdenened with cholera and dysentery in addition to their other miseries.
… Lake Chad, which had been shrinking for decades, stopped shrinking briefly,, and the remaining hippo channels winding through the papyrus and water hyacinths filled up. The dusty plains north of kano, the nigerian trading city, looked lush for the first time in fifteen years. 

Who would have thought that, say, a rural tavern in pennsylvania would be threatened by a storm-born flood that was linked in complicated ways to the ending of a drought half a world away? The green shoots peeping through the sand in the wadis near timbuktu eant really bad news for the oblivious citizens of florida and alabama and the gulf coast of mississippi and bad, though not quite dire, for the citizens of the eastern seabord. They would learn that in due time.

Out at se at the southern tip of africa near the cape of storms, the collision of two ocean currents sends massive pulses of disturbed air into the sky. The benguela current, still chilled by the antarctic frosts, and the agulhas current, still humid with tropical warmth, intersect just southeast of cape town, and the storms they cause coil and twist, boilig up great black thunderheads, tearing the surface off the sea with a howling roar, and assaulting the land beyond. The gales race across the cape peninsula and blast out to sea again, across table bay to the open atlantic beyond, where they finally lose their potency in thte frigid waters off nambia. 

Tried to still my terror with her beating heart.

Wind became personal, a thing, capricious and malevolent, to be treated with utmost caution and constant suspicion.  

Made the sea shiver.

No real wind blows, only a gentle sea breeze. 

A roiling coil of supercharged air was churning.

The seas were rearing up and hurling themselves on the shore with a thunderous roar. 

Made the bedrock quiver.


Aristotle shows that air is a thing by inflating a bag. Closes it, try pouring water into it.
Philo of byzantium, in the third century bc, performed a more sophisticated version of aristotle’s mass experiment, and was thus the first to really prove that air has substance. He attached a tube to a glass globe, then inserted the open end of the tube into a dish of water. When he placed the globe inshadow, the water rose within the tube. When he exposed the globe to sunlight, the level fell. “The same effect,” he wrote, “is produced if one heats the globe with fire.”
He had - though he didn’t know it - stumbled on the true cause of wind.
——Mazyd does this as explanation for where the istil wind comes.

After the greeks, alchemy and astrology dominated the physical sciences until the middle ages.

Phlogiston theory. Reduce everything to three essences that make up all matter, essence of inflammability (phlogiston) , essence of fluidity, essence of salt. Under the presence of the church, living matter was excluded from this taxonomy, because it contained the potential for a soul that differed in composition from nonliving matter, since it was divinely inspired, was necessarily outside earthly classification. Stahl’s vitalism theory, outlined in The True Theory of Medicine.
All metals were made of a calx, or residue, combined with phlogiston, the fiery principle, which was liberated during combustion, leaving only the calx. Air, according to this theory, was merely a receptacle for phlogiston. Combustables, or calcinable substances, were not elements at all, but merely compounds for containing phlogiston. FOr example, rusting iron was believed to be losing its phlogiston and thereby returning to its elemental state.
Similarly, flames extinguish because the air becomes saturated with phlogiston. Charcoal leaves little residue after burning because it is nearly pure phlogiston. Mice die in confined spaces because the air becomes saturated with phlogistion.
It explaines how air at first supports combustion and then after a while does not. 
But why did some metals, such as magnesium, actually gain mass when burned? Phlogistonists finessed the discrepancy by assigning phlogiston a negative mass, or by asserting that air entered the metal to fill the vacuum after phlogiston left.

Cantakerous.

Joseph Priestly, discovered the existence of oxygen, was a devout believer in phlogiston theory (he simpley called oxygen ‘dephlogisticated air’) and late in his life issued a ringing denunciation of the antiphlogistons, whose activities he actually compared to Robespierre and the Terror. 
Lavoisier showed that oxygen is required for combustion, as well as for rusting and respiration.
Lavoisier died on the guillotine during the Terror. “It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like”

The ionosphere is a flexible, dynamic, and rather fragile system buffeted about by electromagnetic emissions, by variations in the earth’s magnetic field, and by the acoustic motion of the atmosphere itself. 


Changes in the magnetosphere seem to be transmitted to the lower atmosphere, where they may influence the circulation of air masses. If we can discover the physical links between these two regions of our environment that trigger weather and climate changes, we can better predict and prepare for our weather.

Wind itself is a product of solar radiation, but it is shaped and affected by planetary rotation, pressure differentials, and by air in all its multple movements, patterns and paths.

All the tunder cells caused by the great furnace of the saharn summer.
Saharan storms are easy to see: sulfurous clouds of yellow sand swirl up into the angry blacks of the clouds. The nomads know better than to be caught on a high dune in a windstorm.  
When they reach tropical waters, they either stall, or they don’t. Again, if the conditions are right - the water temperature just right, the upper atmosphere still no shear is found at the high altitudes to cut off their tops - the low-pressure systems they have become begin to slowly spin as the coriolis force takes hold. 
Take the lid off a pot of steaming water - moist air began to ascend rapidly, moisture and energy were dumped at high altitudes, surface winds rushed into the vacuum thus created and in turn forced the winds into a tighter circular motion.

I was once pursued by a windstorm across the arid great karoo of south africa… the first we knew about the storm, the first inkling that something was amiss, was when our own dust overtook us; a following wind had gotten up, and it was strengthening fast. I looked over my shoulder anad the horizon was already a luridly dirty purple lit up with shaeets and jagged spears of lightning. For a moment I thought I saw a yellow-tinged funnel shape reaching toward the ground, and if it were true, that would mean really bad news.

That the storm was moving was evident. We could see it coming after us, we could see it pass by, we could see it vanish oer the horizon. So why, I wondered in later years, did no one figure out that weather traveled? … the notion that storms were self-contained systems that moved from one place to another was never mooted. It wasn’t until the nineteenth centure, when data colelction was developed, that it was understood —— Jandris see these storms as oozing sparks of chaos and wrath into the material world.

This is the familiar story of the scientific method, of course. It is the way scientific understanding advances. First come the framing theories, almost always wrong, then the painstaking accumulation of data, then corrected theories, then more data, and only afterward the brilliant insight. After which the pattern repeats itself.

Anaximander believed that air, that every thing, earth and heavens above, came into exisgence when the primordial sea was dried by celecstial fires, source of fires unspecified. All nature prodcut of few properties - hot and cold, wet and dry, light and dark.
Wind was a current formed when miss were urned off by the sun. Wind he said, was a flowing of air.  Simple flow tank to show that air and wind were really the same thing.
Aristotle: if winds were indeed a ‘flowing of air’, this must mean that all winds were one wind because all air was one air. To him, this was self-evidently false. ‘This is just like saying all rivers are one and the same river, and an ordinary mans view is better than a philosopher’s view like this one,’ he declared. Wind is an exhalation arising from the earth.

Heat makes air move.

Puerility

Smoak

Shoot a cannon straight up in the air to prove the earth rotates.

Before these whirlwinds come on… there appears a heavy cloud to the northeast which is very black towards the horizon, but towards the upper part is a dull reddish color. The tempest came with great violence, but after a while the winds ceased all at once and a calm succeeded. 

Seacaptains understood that low pressure meant a storm- and no ship would leave port without a glass, as barometers were called. But they didn’t know why.
The storms center could be found by the simple expedient of facing the wind, in which case the center would be to your right. If you did this periodicallly, you could tell which wat the storm was moving. The worst place to be was in the direct path of the storm or toward its right, that is, to the north of a storm tracking west, or to the east of a storm tracking north. Bowditch called that the dangerious semicircle, where the winds actually pushed vessels back into the center of the storm. ONly works for the northern hemisphere.

William redfield - cyclonic nature of storms - drawn from tracking detailed reports of hurricane damage after a storm had passed through connecticut. He learned from these reports that trees had been felled in differetn directions, depending on where they had been in the storms path. And it became clear that although at certain places the winds had been driving in from the north, those same northerly winds felled trees in southerly counties before they did their dmage in more northerly ones. The only explanation possible was that the storm was, in essence, a giant whirlwind.

Sometimes you really can see the wind. Directly, not just by watching trees sway or ripples skitter across open water. Blizard. At its height, you could stare out the window and watch the white wind dipping and swirling through the trees, heaping the snow up in great sculptured drifts, darting around the corner of the house. Brutal violet  dust wind, sahara, where the wind blows a gritty ochre and dun, tornados are lethally visible.

The slow, turning wheel of low-pressure systems

Little zephyrs tickle the fine hairs on the forearm. 

Hot air in one place, cooler in another - there you have it, wind.
Presseure differentils - wind.
Climate zones - wind.
Altitude differentials.
Planetary rotation. 
The physics is not complicated. Windi s air moving from high pressure to low pressure, in a straight line, deflected by the rotation of the earth.

Coriolis loc 1135

On top of the roar of the waves and the clattering shutter was the sound of the wind gusting in the spruces, varying in pitch from a howl to a whine.

Most deserts lie in the calms of cancer or calms of capricorn.  Horse latitudes - calm winds.

Beautiful Edinburgh, her gray warmed into gold by the summer sunshine, lies half-asleep at the foot of her Castle Rock, and dreams, through the peaceful present, of her stormy, impetuous past. Each grain of dust there is historic. The traveler’s every footstep wakes some memory of old days. Over castle and palace, broad way and narrow close, over Canongate, Grassmarket, Arthur’s Seat, over hills that environ and streams that link, a magician has cast his spell—so intimately blending past and present, that we cannot look upon the one without remembering the other.
To-day in sculptured marble, as erstwhile in life, the weaver of the spell yet guards his time-worn city, like the good genius of its fate. Passionless, mute, he sits brooding—the bustle of existence all around him—while the hound at his side gazes up at him, in rest unbroken as his own. The Scott monument—that is what rises before us; and the broad-browed, deep-eyed enchanter within, that—as every schoolboy knows—is the great Sir Walter Scott, the good, well-loving, dearly-loved Sir Walter.

Poor Camp went over to the majority of dogs in January; 

For, “you either love cats, or you do not love them,” says a witty author; and statistics go to prove that those who love cats are the majority to-day. 


Our exclusive world is apt to choose its pets like its garments—in accordance with the fashion of the day. Still, there are always a few people who prefer choosing for themselves; and from this independence queer intimacies often result. Accident, too, not infrequently cuts the knot of custom; while, furthermore, it is true of all that propinquity works wonders. We come by degrees to like what we live with; and discover merits on long acquaintance that a shorter one would not reveal.

I should certainly pour a propitiatory libation to Hermes, god of wayfarers, thieves, vagabonds, mendicants, and the like. 

I think I began first to know the power of the poor, and to fall under their sway, when I was certainly not more than six years old. It must have been about then that I was learning to sew. This seems to have been a profession to which I was so temperamentally disinclined that my mother, to sweeten the task, was wont during the performance of it to read to me. While I sat on a hassock at her feet scooping an unwilling perpendicular needle in and out of difficult hems, my mother would read from one of many little chap-books and children's tracts, which were kept commonly in a flat wicker darning-basket in her wardrobe; little paper books held over from her own and her mother's childhood. They were illustrated with quaint woodcuts, and the covers of them were colored. I was allowed to choose which one was to be read.
One day—&quot;because the time was ripe,&quot; I suppose—I selected a little petunia-colored[Pg 3] one, outwardly very pleasing to my fancy. It contained the story and the pictures of a miserable beggar and a haughty and unfeeling little girl. He was in rags, and reclined, from feebleness I fancy, on the pavement; she walked proudly in a full-skirted dress, strapped slippers, and pantalets. She wore a dipping leghorn with streamers. Just over this she carried a most proud parasol; just under it a nose aristocratically, it may even be said unduly, high in the air.
I think I need not dwell on the tale, save to say that it was one of the genus known as &quot;moral.&quot; There was only one ending possible to the story: the triumph of humility, the downfall of pride and prosperity; swift and awful retribution falling upon her of the leghorn and pantalets. I believe they allowed her in the last picture a pallet of straw, a ragged petticoat, bare feet, clasped hands, and a prayerful reconciliation with her Maker. The story was rendered distinctly poignant for me by the fact that I possessed a parasol of pink &quot;pinked silk,&quot; which was held on Sundays and certain other occasions proudly—it also—over a leghorn with streamers which dipped[Pg 4] back and front exactly as did the little girl's in the story. But never, never,—once I had made the acquaintance of that story,—was my nose carried haughtily under it, when by chance I sighted one of that race so numerous and so ancient, so well known and so little known to us all. From that day I began to know the power of the poor.
I can remember delectable candies that I did not buy, delicious soft cocoanut sticks that I never tasted, joys that I relinquished, hopes that I deferred, for the questionable but tyrannous comfort of a penny in an alien tin cup, and the inevitable &quot;God bless you, little lady!&quot; which, remembering her of the leghorn and pantalets, I knew to be of necessity more desirable than the delights I forewent.
There was an old blind man there in my home town, whom I remember very keenly. He used to go up and down, he and his dog, in front of the only caravansary the place boasted,—the Hotel Latonia,—tap-tap, tap-tapping. He had the peculiar stiff, hesitating walk of the blind, the strange expectant upward tilt of the face. He wore across his shoulder a strap on which was fastened a little tin cup.
[Pg 5]
I used to see the drummers and leisurely men of a certain order, their chairs tilted back against the hotel wall, their heels in the chair-rungs, their hats on the back of their heads, their thumbs in their arm-holes, their cigars tilted indifferently to heaven, and they even cracking their jokes and slapping their knees and roaring with laughter, or perhaps yawning, perfectly unaware of the blind man, it seemed, while he passed by slowly, tap-tap, tap-tapping.
But it was never thus with me. His cane tapped, not only on the pavement, but directly on my heart. You could have heard it, had you put your ear there. It may have seemed that his eyes were turned to the sky. That was but a kind of physical delusion. I knew better. In some occult way they were searching me out and finding me. I can give you no idea of the command of the thing. Perhaps I have no need to. Your own childhood—it is not improbable—may have been under a similar dominion.
If I thought to experiment and withhold my penny, I might escape the blind man for a while: I might elude him, for instance, while[Pg 6] the other members of the family and the guests in that old home of my childhood were gay and talkative at the supper-table; or afterward, when laughter and song drowned the lesser sounds; or while I stood safe in the loved shelter of my father's arm, listening to conversations I enjoyed, even though I could not understand them; or while, in the more intimate evenings, he took his flute from its case, screwed its wonderful parts together, and, his fingers rising and falling with magic and precision on the joined wood and ivory, played &quot;Mary of Argyll&quot; until I too heard the mavis singing. But later, later, when I lay alone in my bed in the nursery in the moonlight, or, if it were winter, in the waning firelight and the creeping shadows, then, then there came up the stairs and through the rooms the sound of the blind man's cane, tap-tap, tap-tapping. He had come for his penny. And the next time I saw him, with a chastened spirit and a sense of escape I gave him two.
But my own childish subserviency to the poor did not give me so great a sense of their power as my mother's relation to them. She, it seems, was perpetually at their service. Let[Pg 7] them but raise a hand indicating their need ever so slightly, and she moved in quick obedience, although it seemed she too must sometimes have wearied of such service. Guests were many and frequent in that old home, as I have elsewhere told; but these came either by announcement or by invitation; the poor, on the contrary, came unasked, unannounced, and exactly when they chose, as by royal prerogative. Indeed, many a time I have seen my mother excuse herself to a guest, to wait sympathetically upon a man or a woman with a basket,—it might be the queen of the gypsies, with vivid, memorable face; or the Wandering Jew in the very flesh; or it might be Kathleen ni Houlihan herself, all Erin looking out, haunting you, from her tragic old eyes,—offering soap or laces at exorbitant prices, or other less useful wares, tendered for sale and excuse at the kitchen door.

Another, it is true, came in his place, but he was of a wholly different type. He had not the old free manner of Musgrove, yet he was strangely appealing, too. He wore a beard and was stooped and spent and submissive, a man broken by fate. He did not complain. He did not wait rather grandly by the hall clock as Musgrove had done; no, but in the kitchen, about breakfast-time, biding the cook's not always cordial pleasure.
In spite of my mother's sympathy,—which should certainly have made amends for any lack of it in the cook,—he had a way of slipping in and out with a little shrinking movement of his body, like the hound that does the same to escape a blow. One would have said that body and soul flinched. He limped stiffly,[Pg 11] and seemed always to have come a little dazed from far countries.
My mother took even a very keen interest in him. This man was more difficult to reach, but by that very token seemed no doubt the more worthy. He told no wonderful tales to tax your credulity. His very reticence was moving and hard to endure; the death of nine or seven children would have been less sad. He kept coming for quite a long time. Then the day dawned—a day quite like any other, I suppose, though it should have been dark with cloudy portent—when, by some slight misstep, some trifling but old reference on his part when his mind was off its guard, my mother discovered, as by a sudden lightning flash, that this was Musgrove.

As I read, I was aware of a strange intrusion:[Pg 15] a bent form in baggy trousers and rusty coat stooped under the weight of an old and worn harp; behind him, bent also, but by no visible burden, an old man with a violin entered the gateway of the arbor. They came very slowly and deliberately, yet without pause or uncertainty. They did not introduce themselves, being, I knew instantly, quite above such plebeian need. They asked no permission, nor solicited any tolerance. They spoke not a word. It was as if they had long outgrown the need of such earthly trivialities. 

The old violin, more lordly, made no concession[Pg 16] whatever to harmony; he tuned or touched not a string, but with a really kingly gesture put his instrument in the worn hollow of his shoulder, laid his head and cheek over against it, as though lending his whole soul to listen, raised the bow, held it for an immortal instant over the strings, and then drew out a long preliminary note—on, on, on, to the very quivering tip of the bow. 

Musical beggars! I have seen them often since, in one guise or another. Sometimes they trumpet on the trombone or cornet, or blow fearful blasts upon the French horn; I have known them to finesse upon the flute or flageolet. These differences are but inconsiderable. Always I find them equally mighty. I have thought sometimes to get past them with giving them only a great deal more than I could afford. Useless frugality! futile economy![Pg 23] For still they will be laying ghostly hands upon you; still will they be exacting a heavier tribute and demanding that gold and silver of the soul which, as Plato is so well aware, is how infinitely more precious.
Though to outward appearance they are busy with their instruments, how they lay ghostly hands upon your imagination. How they conjure up before the inward eye themselves as they might have been, to levy a new tax upon you. The man with the horn, he who plays always off the key, and always a little ahead of the others, he, it is now mysteriously revealed to you, had meant perhaps, at the very least, to play in an orchestra. And the baggy battered old violin was to have wiped his heated brow with a grand gesture, and bowed condescendingly over his collar to metropolitan audiences, had not his dreams so unaccountably miscarried. And the old thread-bare harp-player, his shabbiness and his bitter face to the contrary notwithstanding, had meant, had really meant, to pluck some sweetness out of life. And the harp itself (yes, even so extensive is the occult power they wield) makes its own special appeal to you,[Pg 24] and with its taste for delicacy seems suddenly like a dull tormented thing, swaying and trembling under the stiff sullen fingers of its master, there on the garish pavement—an instrument which, but for the uncertainty of life (ah, the uncertainty of life!), might have responded how devotedly, in the tempered light of a curtained alcove, to the touch of delicate fingers.

All this they conjure up before the mind's eye, ere they stop their excruciating playing. Then the violin, at the very moment that should have been his gracious one, counts the miserably few pennies. The sullen horn, his instrument tucked under his arm, goes on, still a stave ahead of the rest, a sodden expression in his eyes. The old harpist swings the harp rudely over his shoulder, and gives the strap an extra twitch to ease the dull weight, and they are off to fresh pavements and districts new. I have seen great tragedians. I have sat through the sleep-walking scene in &quot;Macbeth.&quot; I have heard Banquo knock. I have seen Juliet waken too late in the Capulet tomb and call for Romeo: &quot;O comfortable friar! Where is my lord?&quot; In my schoolgirl[Pg 25] days I saw Booth in his great parts; but none of these master-scenes and fine harmonies have stirred in me so intolerable an emotion of pity or sense of fatality as an old horn, or harp and violin, grouped on a garish pavement, their lives dedicated to cheap music fearfully off the key.

 The people generally known to us as “Kacháris” differ in some material ways from their Hindu and Musulmán neighbours alike in things material and moral. They are certainly not a tall or handsome race, and in general appearance bear some resemblance to the Nepáli, being as a rule shorter and stouter than the people of North-west India, though well fitted to bear up against physical fatigue and hardship. PhysicalIn face and figure they show a distinct approximation to what is known as the Mongolian type, i.e., they have square set faces, projecting cheek-bones, with almond-shaped eyes, and scanty beard and moustache, the last-mentioned being often wanting altogether. In this way they are well fitted for all forms of outdoor (field and factory) labour that require strength rather than skill, and may very reasonably be regarded as the “navvies” of 

2. In mental and intellectual power they are undoubtedly far below their Hindu neighbours; for they possess neither the quickness of apprehension, nor the astonishing power of memory, &amp;c., characteristic of the higher castes among the Hindus. On the other hand, what they do succeed in mastering, often with much toil and painful effort, they digest and retain with much tenacity. Among other social and mental features of character there are two which are seldom wanting to the [2]“Kachári”: (1) he is an intensely clannish being. A fine imposed on one member of a village community is sometimes paid by the whole body of villagers together. When employed in any considerable numbers on a tea factory, the Kachári labourers so employed, resenting some real or fancied wrong done to one of their number, will often leave the garden in a body, even though there may be a month’s pay due to every one of them. Again they have (2) no small share of that quality so powerful for good or evil, according as it is guided into right or wrong channels, i.e., a certain strength of will, “what their friends might call firmness, and their enemies might term obstinacy.” If they once make up their minds, and they are abundantly capable of doing this, to act in a certain way, it is mere waste of time to attempt to reason them out of their resolution, for nothing short of absolute and overpowering physical force is of any avail to turn them from the course they have once for all resolved to adopt and act upon 


 told him some years ago by an officer in charge of the subdivision of Mangaldai, the late A. J. Primrose, I.C.S. A Kachári of Sekhár Mauza was brought before this magistrate on a charge (manslaughter) involving a very heavy penalty, when he without hesitation admitted his guilt, though the evidence against him was of the slightest, or at least utterly insufficient to secure a conviction. The relations of the sexes too are on the whole of a very sound and wholesome character, far more so probably than in many countries boasting of a higher civilisation. Infant marriage is as yet unknown among them, and so far as the present writer has been able to ascertain during the past forty years, the young people are as a rule chaste before marriage and true to their marriage vows in after-life. But it must be clearly understood that all this holds good of the Kachári in his simple, patriarchal, village life, and there only. His innocence is the innocence of ignorance, not the innocence of experience: and he is as a rule free from certain forms of evil because in his village life he has never come under any temptation to indulge in them. When contaminated by civilization, e.g., when brought into contact with our civil and criminal courts, much of this innocence must inevitably disappear; and of this sad deterioration of character any man who has been long in the country, and learnt to know the people well, must have experienced many melancholy and painful illustrations.

Both Sahagún and Toribio de Benavente (also called &quot;Motolinía&quot;) observed that the Aztecs gladly parted with everything. Even the &quot;stage&quot; for human sacrifice, the massive temple-pyramids, was an offering mound: crammed with the land's finest art, treasure and victims, then buried underneath for the deities. 

Starting about 10000 bce, very soon after the final melting of the continental glaciers, though quite slowly at first, people began to adopt a more settled way of life, grouping together in village communities. Crops were planted, herds were corralled, the flora and fauna selectively bred. Into this relatively uniform, mostly undifferentiated, largely homogeneous world, of subsistence farmers and peasant hamlets, the idea of civilization was born: in a single place, at a single time. From there and then the concept spread at remarkable speed.

Mesopotamian alluvial plain was potentially fertile but had low annual rainfall, requiring that people get together to organize systems of irrigation. ‘ Hydraulic civilizations’ - need to control water demande collective action, so stimulating the development of an organizing bureaucracy, which led inevitably, to typical oriental despotic rule. This view no long much respected.

The first civilization - and the origin of writing - began with the ‘brand’

With the advent of mass production - of tetiles, ceramics, beverages and processed food, consumers wanted to be assured of the origin and quality. These products were given a mark that uniquely identified their origin and source - lumps of clay as seals. Amulets stamped onto clay. Then cylindrical seals, where the image when rolled is 3 times longer than diameter-harder to copy.

Settled societies required greater labor than hunter gatherers. SO why? Hunter gatherers lived in equilibrium with their environment, settled required greater and greater exploitation. Skeletons from early farming communities showed changes brought about by many hours of labor required to harvest and process cereals by hand. Their towns were associated with increased rates of disease and vermin. Problems with waste disposal and drainage.

One theory - adoption of farming brought about by establishment of year round settlements. These experienced increase population growth, forcing them to exploit greater amount of resources, before requiring adoption of agriculture to sustain them. All this does is shift debate from ‘why farming’ to ‘why sedentesim’.

Augustine 
- They physical body is a trap within which the divine spark is caught. Procreation is perpetuating the power of evil. By having sex, producing children, you are trapping into these physical structures, the divine spark. Being thwarted by the physical body - sex, appetite, disease, everything.

Are you so in favor of others sharing the miseries of life? Would you have us drag down any mortal soul and bind him to our labors and privations? The world is no place for the divine soul. The only hope for the soul in man is that it need be awakened and released. For the church in rome, this is too much of a kindness, no, the soul must be burdened with responsibilities, pay priests and bishops to order it around, give confessions to a priest who has more wine, more women, and swears as much or more as himself!

Oh dear.
One hundred soldiers- fresh recruits - and One thousand Denars to train them with.
Ok.
The recruits can be trained into two different companies. Infantry and Cavalry. Infantry training costs 4 denars. Cavalry costs 12. You with me so far?
One thousand denars. One hundred soldiers. Four. Twelve.
Good. So the task is this: What is the maximum number of Cavalry can you train if you have to train all troops under budget.
What’s that now?
You’ve got 1000 Denars. One hundred soldiers to train. Cavalry costs 12. Infantry costs 6.  You need to train all soldiers with that 1000 denars. What is the maximum number of Cavalry you can train?
I might need a little bit with this one.
The answer isnt nearly as impotant as how you get it.

Animal that attacks by vomiting it’s stomach out. Stomach has fangs. Prolapsed stomach.
 Many species dine on animals with bones or shells, so little bits can get stuck in the Mucous-y lining of their stomach. Seastar - everts stomach, secretes digestive enzymes which break down the prey into a soupy chowder substance. The stomach is then pulled back into the body and the food is transferred to the pyloric stomach to finish digestion.

Psychopathic stare - prelude to self gratification or exercise of power. Not a stare of interest or of empathy. Cold. Detached, Emotionless, icy, intense, piercing, empty, penetrating.

Then you have to talk or I have to talk. I get scared when it gets quiet. I was with mother alot, and grandmother, and they would go uptown and see a movie or somethin, and they would always leave me with him. Cause he was either home drunk or with a hangover from bein drunk, and then that was when he would do what he did to me. And I can remember crying and goin to the door and beggin for them not to leave me and they would, every time. I can remember one time I had a girl to spend the night with me, and he did it. And my mother was there, a lot of times.


You think you regressed?
I know I did.
Tell me about that.
Well. To begin with, I don’t know how I did or when it first started. Because I didn’t realize it when it happened. But, somehow or another, I got the feeling that I would have a better time with younger people. Which I was havin a pretty good time. Until I realized it all had to come to an end. The way I realized that was to get a divorce. I don’think I could be married to a man like him.
Why is that?
Well he is a hard working man. And when someone makes love to me now, I want them to be affectionate and consoling, not just there to have sexual intercourse. And I have never had that. I think thats why I kind of turned against Dr. Graham. When I’m with him I’ll feel attracted towards him. Then he’ll say somethin that hits me the wrong way and I go to pieces.

The purpose of the deformities is to highlight the deformed nature of man. Our biological selves are insufficient. Not just the physical but the mental. Incapable of being purified. Also to highlight the shit deity. ‘Natural’ is the enemy.

-petit mal epilepsy - short seizures which resemble fainting. Can occur several hundred times per day. General pattern - sudden lapse of conscious during which there is a vacant stare and fluttering of the eyelids. If the patient is doing anything when the attack occurs, there is a momentary cessation, then a continuation of the action, often without the patient being aware of the interruption.

- grand mal epilepsy - deformed nose from many falls. Nose smushed up into his face lik a pigs, but with none of the symmetry.  Period just before the attack, where the patient feels a disturbing sensation known as an ‘aura’. During this period, a definite change from the normal brain rhythm occurs. When the attack begins, the patient usually utters a sharp cry, and whether standing or sitting, suddenly falls. In a typical grand mal attack, marked pallor is followed by deep cyanosis. The body is rigid at first, the tonic spasms of the muscles cause the limbs to jerk in a convulsive movement. The eyes roll upwards or to the side. The pupils dialate, and the facial expression becomes distorted. The convulsions are usually repeated.  The entire seizure may last minutes. THen the patient will usually sleep.

The traumatized person’s sense of their ability to protect themselves has been damaged or destroyed. They feel endagered, even if there is no actual danger in the present, because in the past they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty and they know it is possible.

…people living in unrecovered trauma often behave in very similar ways to the people who traumatized them. Over and over I have seen traumatized people refuse to hear or engage information that would alter their self-concepts, even in ways that could bring them more happiness and integrity… the undiscovered traumatized person’s refusal is rooted in a panic that their fragile self cannot bear interrogation; that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible. Perhaps because supremacy in some produces trama in others, they can become mirror images. And of course, many perpetrators were/are victims themselves.

Ian Hodder has argued that &quot;self-injuring clothing was an essential component of the Catalhöyük culturo-ritual entanglement, representing 'cleansing' and 'lightness'.&quot;

The legal profession has its origins in ancient Greece and Rome. Although in Greece it was forbidden to take payment for pleading the cause of another, the rule was widely flouted. After the time of Claudius, lawyers (iuris consulti) could practise openly, although their remuneration was limited. A skilled and regulated profession developed gradually during the late Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire: advocates acquired more status, and a separate class of notaries (tabelliones) appeared

Remove a column supporting a roof, and theres no longer compression - you’ve got a zone of tensile stress, where the material above the tunnel is trying to pull away from itself. Many materials react differently to tension that compression, and soil and rock are no different. Soil has lotsofstrength against compression, but none against tension. You can’t make a rope out of soil. It has no tension strength.  So if you build a tunnel in soil, you have to replace the column you removed with some other way to transfer the load of the tension above. Rock does have tensile strength. You could make a rope from it. Rocks have breaks, cracks, jointing. Natural jointing follow specific patterns that can be mapped. Rocks that are whole are called massive. Jointed rocks have no tensile strength- the’ll fall right out.

Templar - travelers deposited money at one church, recieved a  note, and withdrew it at another church - international banking. The fees made templars incredibly wealthy.


Philip desired to become the most christian king in europe, and he would stop at nothing to that end. Believes he is the face of christ on earth. He had been borrowing money from the templars to fight the english. Was desperately short of funds. On the verge of bankruptcy. Crusaders had no reason to exist anymore - the templars were vulnerable. Their banks full of crusader cash, and the king knew it. Philip had been devaluing the currency, and that led to an angry mob - chased him into a temple. It was there taht he saw some of the Templar’s treasure. He decided to neutralize the templars and stirp their assets. Only the pope could legitimately rule the order. THe king needed to destabilize them. 
Rumors about the templars were manipulated by PHillip IV. A kind of poison that Phillip used to damage the order. Then, having smeared their reputation, the king launched a surprise attack, and snagged every templar in Paris (Friday the 13th). The king attacked the secrecy of Templar initiations, suggesting deviant behaviour behind closed doors. Accused of financial corruption, and sodomy. Idolatry, including worshipping a cat - all added up to Heresy. This charge had the power to destroy the temple order.
Clement V - puppet pope to Phillip. His agents sent him many letters accusing him of Heresy - had affair with wife of a French nobleman. Reluctantly, Clement was the kings man. He wasn’t even allowed to go to the Vatican. But CLement managed to turn Phillip’s attack into a papal inquiry. Three cardinals went to Shinon prison - far from retracting confession of heresy, the same leaders repeated confessions to the pope’s men. Most of it related to templar initiation rites - The Latin Rule of the Templars - Kept in house - The initiate was asked if he wanted to be a serf and slave forever. If he consorted with women, he would be put in heavy iron, A psalm was said. TUnic presented. BUt shinon parchment says different - Denounce christ after formal rites. The brotherhood performed the ceremony, then took him aside, in the same chapel, and showed him a crucifix with an effigy of christ, and told him that he should not believe in the crucified, and should, in fact, denounce him. Spitting on the cross. Kiss him on the bottom of the back, then on the navel, then on the mouth. Abstain from women, join themselves with brothers of the order.

Eventually Phillip gave ultimatum - either Dissovle the order, or I will start a breakaway church of France. But templar sites had been emptied before Phillip could raid it. We don’t know where it went. Order recieved notice about Phillip’s plan. Boats disappeared. Nothing has been found to this day.


The templars became the super-heros of christianity. Originally a band of nine, their numbers soared. 
Bernard of clairvo- strong warriors on the one hand, and monks waging war with vice and demons on the other. A body of men who need have no fear. These men have no dread of death, confident that in the sight of the Lord, they would be his martyrs.

Torture. The rack was used on young and old. The Strapado - a wench that dropped the bound Templar from a height  and jerked him violently. Bernard’s feet were rubbed with fat and roasted over a fire until his bones slid out. He didn’t torture them so they told the truth. He tortured them so they told his truth.

Relics: sought and fought over, venerated across europe. Famous worldwide as custodians of relics. A templar’s signature alone was enough to prove a relic’s authenticity.

When the spainish tried to intervene, they ended up forcing their allies into a dangerously exposed position, ending up in the most decisive english battle victory of the war. 
Turning victory over a violently subdued population into a lasting peace was tricky, and James used the traditional tool: plantation. Ulster was the heartland of O’Neill support, and it was the least anglicised, most gaelic region of ireland. Naturally, it was here that the new plantations were sent.

Little speech by a Kalemite about biggest weakness is biggest strength. You’ve got to figure out your weakness, and turn it into a strength. Uses paints as an example. Pyetle’s like, “What if my weakness is just weakness in general.”

What about the Seilsian? “He’ll be fine. He’s not of human blood.” &lt;&lt;&lt; foreshadow the fact that Seilsians are immune to the god’s wrath. 
Also, MAzd Oro communes with another Seilsian, and that other senses some emotional attachment to Pyetle, suggest severing that link since he is no longer of use.

Kalemites - little speil on how art is what they use to communicate - spiel on creativity.

Self defence - catholic church was wary of it, on the ground that it was egoistic action, undertaken by a person strictly for his own benefit rather than for that of the community,. As such, it was directly contrary to the divine command of the gospels to turn the other cheek- so that a christian who engaged in it imperilled his immortal self and risked eternal damation.

At the same time, though, individual self-defence was held to be permitted instead by natural law, which recognised a fundamental right of self-preservation as a ‘naturl’ or instinctive feature of the human species. Strictly speaking, states hd a natural-law right of self-defence tooo, against aggressors.
Because of its status as natural-law right, no permission required from any higher authority for its exercise. 

It was held by John of Legnano that heavenly bodies possessed no right of self-defence, apparently because they were not ‘receptive of foreign impressions’.
self -defense was seen as an exercise of a primeval right of survival under any and all conditions - a right possessed by wrongdoers as well as by champions of justice.
Preemptive action was permitted, when a foe was ‘bold and ready to strike’. Some slight tolerance for action after the fact as well.to strike back at his attacker even if there was no threat of a further blow. This was in the interest of allowing the victim to avoid ‘disgrace and humiliation’ or ‘dishonour and loss of face’. Or, action in hot pursuit to recover property immediately after a robbery.
In principle, the rule was that selfdefence served only the very limited purpose of fending off a blow in the course of delivery or preventing the consummation of an ongoing attack. 

SOme bishops held that killing was sinful, even in a just cause, adn that penance was therefore required. 

Battle of Hstings in 1066 - when the Norman bishops laid down an elaborate schedule of penances. Simply for fighting in a just war, a penance of three years was prescribed. One year of penance was required of a fighter for each enemy soldier that he knew that he hd killed. If a soldier struck an enemy but was unsure whether death had ensued or not, the penance was forty days. If the number of opponents that a soldier killed was not known, then there was to be penance of one day per week for the rest of the soldier’s life ( or the building or endowing of a church as a substitute). There was a special rule for archers, who shot from afar and naturally would not know the effects of their cts: penance for three Lents. THe most extreme sanction was reserved for those with the improper animus. THese killings were straightforward homicide (even if the cause was just), requiring seven years’ penance. Even the commander himself, Duke William of NOrmandy made amends for the conflict in the form the endowing of Battle Abbey, which still stands as a tangible monument to the force of the medieval law of just wars.

The purpose of war, it must always be remembered, was not the destruction of th enemy for its own sake but rather the obtaining of justice. This principle of necessity imported a balancing test - a weighing of the suffering caused by the war, against the military advantage at stake.

‘If an end is permissible, the necessary means to that end are also permissible’.

What is art? Art is - excuse me - Art is the living and concrete proof that man - or people I should say, “ tipping his hat to Syram. “Art is the living and concrete proof that people are capable of reproducing consciously, and thus on the plane of meaning, the union of sense, need, impulse, and action characteristic of the living creature.”
“The hell does that mean?”
“It means, my luddite friend, that we are all separated from each other by an impermeable boundary. We are each alone. Art is that which brings two minds together, as it was in the beginning. As it was intended.”
“That sounds like love.”
“It is nothing so grotesque. Love is the realm of horny goats and bitches in heat. Art is the function ”

To be a simple creature is to have sense, need, and impulse. To be human is to have an awareness of the future. To act human is to organize the future. To live human, then, is to work long and hard to shape a chain of cause and effect that might, when casted out into the void,  latch on to a more desirable world. It’s a largely futile endeavor; the vast majority of humans have only ever nicked the future; perhaps they caught a lover, or some temporary measure of peaceableness. Nonetheless, the stories of true successes are intoxicating. The very knowledge that one person might move mountains makes life itself, and by extension their own, worth it. 

It is a point of honour to attack the enemy at its strongest, rather than its weakeset point, on the ground that iwas ignoble to exploit the weakness of another.

Regulus captured by carthaginians in the first punic war - allowed by captors to return to rome to take part in a debate over whether rome would exchange a group of carthaginian prisoners for himself. He gave his solemn word that, if the roman senate did not agree to the exchange, then he would return to his captivity in Carthage. Once in Rome, he spoke out against the proffered prisoner exchange. Then, true to his word, he returned to his own captivity in Carthage.

IN SItuations of endemic or constant conflict between two peoples, such a contrast is not possible, any more than a science of meteorology would be possible in a society in which the weather never varied. In such a case, war would be, in a certain conceptual sense, invisible by virtue of its very ubiquity (Can use analogy of light/and dark, if you only live in the dark, you would have no word for it).

The Arabs had a specific label for endemic conflic consisting of interminable raiding and counterraiding: razzia, which they clearly distinguished from formal war.

Precolonial Aftrica, the Fante sent a herald to the enemy to declare war, sometimes even to arrange the time and place of battle. Nigerian peoples indicated teh existence of war by laying plantain leaves and piles of powder and shot on paths that would be travelled by their enemies-to-be. - Michoaca - priest burned a number of balls of tobacco, tow men dispatched to place two balls of tobacco and blood-stained arrows and some eagle feathers, in the territory of the enemy. Aztecs famously sent series of missions to request surrender before war, suppying their enemies with weapons, and foregoing any possibility of surprise.

For the greeks, they sent heralds to sing declaration of war. Overtime, the mere presence of a herald signaled war.

Declaration of war to the people, letting them know challenging times were ahead.

Declaration of a Just war- “No war is just unless formally announced and declared before hand.

	“Trees don’t have souls. Trees aren’t even living things.”
Dan gives Ralph a look.
“If you call it life,” Ralph continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. I can crush a rock with my hammer and I can crush a bug with my hammer, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. It’s the killing and the eating.” That last word rolled through Ralph’s beard like a saw.
“What about children?”
	“Trees eat children?”
“Fuck, no… Definition of life. Bugs have children, rocks don’t. That’s what makes a bug alive.”
“Cut a man’s balls off, what is he then? Dead? Just because he can’t have children?”
“He’s of a type that has children.”
Ralph just shrugged. “I say it’s killing. If these trees are alive, then that means they’re killing something. Could be it’s us. I heard once that we’re supposed to be immortal, and that the trees are poisoning the air to age us, so they can feast on our corpses when we die. We think we’re tending the orchard field but it’s really the orchard field tending to us!”
“Where the hell did you hear that?”
“From some pacified herd in the south. They’re mostly dead now. Dog worshippers the were. Fed their dead to packs of dogs to keep them out of the ground. Ground the bones to dust then tossed in with the water the dogs lapped up. Then they made bricks out of the feces.”

It is written in the book of creation,” she began, “that a thing’s greatest strength is also its greatest weakness. On these very foothills of Kelkrim,” she pointed down at the ground for the added effect, “there once stood a forest of mighty oak, trees whose roots dug deep into the foundations of the world, so deep, that they could withstand our southern storms. For thousands of years they flourished, and yet, their anchors were their undoing, for they could not flee the axes of our ancestors. The forest’s greatest strength was its greatest weakness, and so it is no more.” 
“If they’re all gone, how do know they ever existed?”
“I’m just that old, child. ” Her ancient eyes buried into skull like beetles, darting about, as if daring someone else to challenge her claims. “Man too is listed in the book of creation,” she finally continued. “What is man’s greatest strength?”
A young centurion spoke up. 
“His mind!”

Is’t not his heart’s accord, urged outward far and dim,
To wind the world in unison with him?

When on the spindle, spun to endless distance,
By Nature’s listless hand the thread is twirled,
And the discordant tones of all existence
In sullen jamgle are together hurled,
Who, then, the changeless orders of creation
Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance?
Who brings the One to join the general ordination,
Where it may throb in grandest consonance?
Who bids teh storm to passion stir the bosom?
In brooding souls the sunset burn above?
Who scatters every fairest April blossom
Along the shining path of Love?
Who braids teh noteless leaves to crowns, requiting
Desert with fame, in Action’s every field?
Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting?

Bigotry comes from feeling threatened.

Pindar - poet - custom is king of all. Great king darius, was interested to know of the funerary customs of two distinct peoples. Greeks, Kalatian indians. Greeks cremate whereas indians cannibalize deadrelatives. Asked greeks how they disposed of dead, greeks said we cremeate them. Darius then asks the kalatians how they did, and the kalatians were horrified to hear that the greeks cremate their dead. They say we cannibalize their dead. The greeks though ‘oh my goodness, utter limits of barbarism.’ ‘No’, heroditus said - every people believe that its own custms how you dispose of the dead is central to who a people are and where they see their place in the world. Custom is king.

The loser of a knife fight dies in the street, and the winner dies on the way to the hospital. 

What I was taught growing up is that, when someone attacks you with a knife, you WILL be cut in some way; there’s no way to avoid it unless you can escape the situation entirely by running. What one must do is decide where and how they’ll be cut, and focus on getting away as fast as possible. 

This idea that you don't have to accurately represent people you don't like is causing the downfall of Western liberal society. Post truth world and all that. If you do, things get complicated and it gets harder to hate.

Note also that he never moves his sword into a position where he can’t recover to either counterattack or defend himself. 
Now start watching them move. They’re (usually) just out of each other’s reach which is exactly where they should be. Watch their footwork too. Their movements are crisp and clean and neither of them over commit when they lunge. See how their front knee never goes in front of their front foot when they lunge? That’s a sign that they’re keeping control of their bodies and not exposing themselves to a counterattack. 

Has anyone ever told you that you’re dumb as fuck? No no no, im not saying your dumbe as fuck, im asking if anyone has ever told you that.


Years ago, I read a comment written by a guy who survived a stabbing and he said what stuck out the most to him was how, obviously, we’re not accustomed to feeling any sensations in most of our internal organs, but it was more the temperature of the blade itself that stood out, since metal is so cold compared to our body temperature.
I don’t recall him saying much about the actual pain it caused or not. Just awareness of how wrong the contrast of temperature was and not expecting it, because who tf would?
Evidently, the opposite is true when shot. People describe it as being similar to a powerful punch, but the bullet feels hot, obviously.

GOLD: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2013.12615
New research reveals that high-grade veins of gold contain clusters of gold nanoparticles, which is important because it explains how these impossibly rich aggregations of gold can form in fractures below the earth. Laboratory experiments have long found that it's impossible to dissolve enough gold in hydrothermal fluids to ultimately crystallize out to form thick, high-grade veins of the glittering stuff. Hydrothermal fluids are heated liquids, warmed by magma in the earth's crust, which carry complex stews of dissolved minerals and gases. 
The new study, which was published May 18 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests that these veins don't come from dissolved gold at all. Instead, they may be accumulations from so-called colloidal fluids, in which the particles of gold aren't dissolved, but instead suspended.

&quot;We're the first people to get an image to essentially prove that, yes, these nanoparticles, these colloids, exist,&quot; in geothermal systems, said study lead author Duncan McLeish, a doctoral candidate in Earth sciences at McGill University in Montreal.

First page - 
Francis Bacon is deeply suspicious of narrative. For him, narrative seems to be the natural enemy of vision; it blinds. Narrative is boring because it precludes the direct actualization of a painting via the viewer’s perception. Story-tellers are seducers, diverting the audience’s attention from what there is to see.

One of the singular features of the Strait of Gibraltar is the Mediterranean inflow and outflow, which consists of layers of water that have different salinity (levels of salt).
The water in the Atlantic is less salty and less dense than water in the Mediterranean, and it flows eastwards into the Mediterranean through the Straits as a surface layer, about 125m deep with a speed of two to three knots.
In contrast, there is a westward outflow of heavier, colder, and more salty water, which works its way out into the Atlantic. The tidal flow will either speed up or slow down the eastern flowing current, depending on the phase of the tide.

A depression is just a bit of land that’s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you’re walking along, you’ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It’s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. It’s not a mountain whose peak is hidden in a blizzard. It’s not a grey and stormy ocean whose innumerable waves wrap around the horizon. It’s not an endless desert filled only with mirages that flicker just out of reach. It’s just, you know, a shallow dip in the road. You might not even notice it.
Suffice to say, a depression is not very depressing, and that’s why Pyetle hated the word. He thought it was prejudicial to use the same word to describe both a dimple of land and his own private psychological desolation. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him; made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone’s been sad, so everyone’s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they’ve got the place mapped; but a really meaty nihilistic stupor, well Pyetle knew it wasn’t on any goddamn map. It was perfectly reasonable for someone to get lost there and never find their way out.
Some people are born there. Whether by nature or nurture they are trapped in that dimension at the earliest age. Pyetle was such a creature, and as such he knew that he was destined to lead a life unlived - whether it be by suicide or apathy or distraction. He reasoned he was old enough now at forty-two to opt for suicide - as what little in the way of pleasure his life could offer, it must have offered by now. So three days ago he began to drink, and he did not stop until late on the second night, when his stockpile of wineskins were emptied. He then slept, then woke an hour later in a sweat and vomited what seemed to him to be the whole of his stomach, and then promptly went back to sleep.
On the third day he rose again, this time to wander the streets of Jeket aimlessly until final inspiration took him. 

And with a lengthened string of similar broken sentences, delivered with extraordinary volubility, the stranger led the way to the traveller's waiting-room, whither he was closely followed by Mr. Pickwick and his disciples.

The Season was the name given to the months between late January and early July. It officially began when Parliament reopened in London and was the season for social entertainments – balls, theatre parties, dances, masquerades, military reviews, and other social pleasures enjoyed by the ton. Families with marriageable children used the Season to present their children to the ton in hopes of arranging profitable marriages. For this reason, the Season has also been called the &quot;Marriage Mart&quot; by notables such as Lord Byron. For marriageable girls, the Season was an intense period of social networking in which a faux pas could affect their marriage and social prospects within the ton.

The difference between people’s opinions of history, history, and what actually happens.

The difference between design and pattern. Complex pattern doesn't require a designer.
It's worth being careful how you use words, because complex design DOES require a designer, in the same way complex carpentry requires a carpenter: design is literally what designers do.
The geometry of the Mandelbrot set exhibits complex pattern and no design. Biological organisms exhibit features that can appear designed, because they can appear to exist for a purpose... until we realise that &quot;purpose&quot; is illusory in nature: evolution doesn't intentionally solve problems or work towards goals.
So... I think it's good to try to avoid using words like &quot;design&quot; and &quot;purpose&quot; when talking about evolved biological features, to avoid encouraging people to think in terms of illusions.

Anand on losing in championships:
Logically, you will say, thinking about losing two games is not going to make me feel better, what has happened has happened, let us move on. That’s what you’re supposed to do. That’s what most people think will happen. But under the strain and pressure, what very often unfortunately happens is, you make the problem even worse for yourself. You lose one more. And then you lose two more. Somehow you cant stop. Then you go back home, and you know you should be trying to find some hope, but you don’t believe in it, and so you get angry. Its getting worse. 
If I were to choke you, youd stop breathing. If you can stop the istil wind, the world would die. Breath of the world. That funny logic.

To you it looks like bravery.

Idea of sunset looking bad. Fortelling weather. Canny instincts
“Fred, I never seen a sunset like this in my life. I can’t believe it but we’re goin a have somethin of this. Call the gang out and put the gear on the deck.”

Bozo people, who live on the southern fringes of the sahara, believe the Wind wrestled with water, and water lost, which is the origin of the great desert.
The niger river is all the water that is left from the dawn of time, and the bozo people became its stewards. 

Push winds into caves and seal them in with stones.

Finnish wizards sold knotted ropes to mariners - first knot for a breeze, second for a stiff wind, third for a gale, and the fourth for… well you dont want to untie the fourth unlness you were in port and your enemy was still at sea.

Joseph conrad Typhoon:
“The sudden smashing of a vial of wrath. It seems to explode all around the shihp with an overpowering concussion and a rush of great waters, as if an immense dam had been blown up to windward. In an instant the men lost touch of eachother. This is the disintegrating power of a great wind: it isolates one from one’s kind. A furious gale attacks him like a personal enemy, tries to grasp his limbs, fastens upon his mind, seeks to rout his very spirit out of him.”

Some local winds, like the meltemi that rules the greek summers, are based on larger patterns. The meltemi is dependent on the monsoons that center on pakistan in conjunction with the steady high pressure ridge over the balkans. Winds like this are predictabel in patterns. Aristotle, for example, said it arrived after the summer solstice on june 21. Once the meltemi blows a watch may be set by its rhythms. Stirring at ten in the morning, blowing hard around two, dying at six and calm by eight.”

When the wind blows the desert trembles. The dunes literally shiver and shift and horizons disappear.
A mist or fog of dust as fine as flour, Filling the eyes, the lungs, the pores of the skin, the nose and throat, getting into the locks of rifles, the works of watches and cameras, defiling water, food and everything les, rendering life a burden and acurse. 
Air was thick with grit. Stripped of moisture. When the gale is in full cry, visibility is reduced to a few yards. Sand penetrates everything. Grit gets into the food, water, sheets in the hotels. If you close windows, the temperature climbes to 120;
If the ghibli blows forty days, god preserve us from the evil. The camel becomes pregnatn without the intervention of the male. 
The air is so impregnated with sand that the air is darkened, the sky appears of a dusky yellow and the sun is barely perceptible. Eyes become red, swelled and inflamed, the lips and skin parched and chapped, while sever pain in the chest in consequence to the quantities of sand unavoidably inhaled. 

Strips of summer fallow, seared with head, crunched, like old fallen leaves, our wheat. 

When drought persisted, the unanchored topsoil began to move. Blowing topsoil drifted across the roads and ralroad tracks, keeping towns and cities bathed in dust and grit inside and out, causeing yellow twilights at midday. ;

My husband stood it for two months, a memoir by a saskatchewan farm wife lamented, watching our farm blow away in the winds, listening to that awful whistling, and then one day he hauled open the odor and fought his way out onto the porch, yelling and screaming so hard it broke my heart. Her husband strode off into the gale and was not seen again.
 - the tubu. The massif lies mostly in chad, but it stretches north into libya and even west into niger. It is really less a mountain range than it is a rupture in the earth, formed when lava streams forced their way through the planetary skin, leaving a stratum of crystalline rock covered with sandstone. This sandstone was then forced violently upward again as two massive tectonic plates collided, deep within the mantle
Massif called tibesti
  the hot breath of the desert flung itself against emi koussi and scaled rapidly into the upper troposphere. The superheated air rushing up the slopes (in what is called anabatic, or up-mountain, flow) at some point met the cooler, denser air flowing downard (katabaticflow), creating pulses of turbulence, rapid mixing, and the formation of massive thunderheads and ominous, towering black clouds. The sulfurous volcanic air was riven by lightning, and thunder rolled across the ravines, echoing off the boulders that wer scattered like a giant’s abandoned toy box across the landscape. 
On the superheated plains west of the salt mining center of bilma the rains fell, but the air was so hot it flash-evaporated the water before it could reach the ground, and the tuareg nomads could see the cooling water falling without ever feeling it.

Anaximenes: air is the first principle of things, for from this all things arise and into this all are resolved again.” Its properties were intermediate between fire and water, and air was therefore the basic matter from which these two were formed. Some centuries later PLutarch, who was a great admirer of anaximenes, quoteed hima s saying, ‘ all things are th us generated by a certain condensation or rarefaction of it.

Everyone is the same divine spark, just more or less of it.

Medieval arrow - sophisticated and expensive pice of ammunition.
So many stages - cleft wood in squares that you’ve got toround, you barrel it, tapers at the ends, then cut and fashion the feathers and stick them on with rabbit hide glue - but thats not strong enough so you’ve got to whip-bind that with silk thread. Then youve got to cut a nock and reinfore that with a transverse cut in which you slide a slip of horn. Thats before you’ve got to go to the blacksmith to make arrowheads.

Its all about repitition - shoot shoot shoot. Stamina. Phenomenal about of power. Medieval longbow arrow is a tree trunk - a great thump into the enemy. You’re hitting him at range. Powerful blow. 10 yards at range, 30 yards,, 40 yards. Hard hits. Slugging. Hard as a sledgehammer. Dependso n the angle of strike. 

Longbow - relatively inexpensive weapon for delivering thump after thump after thump.
Terrain defeats an army.

Enourmous mob of guys, much too deep to serve any purpose. Get in formation!

Hollywood battles - everyone dies. Casualty rate is ridiculous. The result is always that everyone dies. This is just not how battles work. You have a certain number of men in formation, and when they start to see that things are going against them, especially when they realize they’ve lost order, they’re going to retreat. They’re going to get out of there, and then they’ll see what happens next. In these formation battles, most of the time, the casualties would be quite low. Its when the cavalry runs you down, thats when the casualties start.

Pick off the sides, drive the enemy into a narrow space where the numbers are negated.
Digging a pit or ditch can help enourmously to funnel.
Effective heavy calvary, these horses are shoulder to shoulder.

Run and then slow down and start stabbing in more or less even lines.
Dig ditches, many ditches. Once the first ditch is ready, build another one.

In armored combat, there are some hits that you are going to let the opponent have, because you know you can take it. You arent going to defend what doesnt need to be defended.

Almost across the board, people did not make clothes out of leather. Leather biker gear.

Killing a knight at agincourt. This knight has been trained to fight and kill since he was a child. He is very, very good at it. The only way you’ve got any chance of this, is to get six or seven or eight of your friends, and pile in, all at the same time. Dont take turns, or he’ll kill every single one of you. Four of five have to hold him down, and then one or two of you have to stab him in the eyes or in the gaps in the armor.

Determineing ownership of territory with trial by combat.

Pointing your sword out like that, so you have nowhere to go with it, doesnt achieve anything.
You point your weapon out like that and he’s gonna take it away from you.

COMMAND PHILOSOPHY
I like to say I don’t knokw. What you want is everyone onboard thinking. In an extreme crisis you don’t want to act like you dont know whats going on.

Cult: wear you down over days. Get you to divulge your deepest self. What is your greatest pain? Moment of exhultation - from that moment you are hooked.
Encapsulate a person. Mimic. Dismiss the pain. They are no longer an individual but part of a collective.
Cultish singlemindedness.
Sex as a lure. 
Mirror excercise.

Seb thinks he’s smart because he thinks about things. Has his own internal ridiculous logic, and this gives him confidence.

What are you, too scared?No.
Too lazy?
No.
Why not then/
I just don’t want to.
YOu just don’t want to? Do you put any thought into your actions?

Seb, Mandri was dead when your brother was killed. He had no choice in the matter. 
^^^Seb has this internal conflict between the logic of that statement and the rage he feels.

Bully - oh that’s mine. Takes it. “Now say thank you.”
Learning how to fight - he doesn’t even need instruction. Just need a constant reminder of what it means to lose. That will be enough to stimulate him to learn on his own. Because all battle is really a battle between the desire not to try, and the desire not to lose.

Foods : udder - womb - genitals of female pigs. Womb especially. Tongue. Farms dedicated to a certain creature that gives certain qualities.

When someone is dead, they get closer. FOR SEB - gugi.
‘She missed her mother and father more than ever and they’d been dead nine years now, so deeply present in her life that she understood completely how people see ghosts and have conversations with the dead. 

**** Left brain artist = moto
**** right brain genius - mazyd
And it is true that right brain is the true genius. Because right brain has understanding. Get the left brain standing next to a right brain person and the sense of inferiority just oozes off them. They know they’re a charlatan.

When you’re alone for a really long time you learn what’s important to . What kinds of things come to your mind? What do you miss? Maybe this is what mazyd asks individuals.
‘Mostly I think about shit that went wrong. Like I know good things happened to me. But I cant remember them. Or they just don’t come up.’


Abrasion. 
Drifts of sand by the doors and gatets and everthing was gritty to the touch.
 Gugi was up there too, and he had long since spit out his spine because the chewing was making too much noise.

Poisoned sow womb.

There is a Turkish proverb about the matter: &quot;When the blind man opens his eyes, he firstly breaks his walking stick.&quot;
One who overcomes their weakness would try to erase the memory of it.

You can feel their strength just by how they stand and move. The little intricacies. The battle is raging before the swords even come to blows.

Like in chess &gt;&gt;&gt; Play disciplined. Maneuver to be solid. Execute the little things correctly. Dont force anything. Dont overextend. Tactics will come.

Out in the sand the wind is made flesh. God s made flesh. Thin tendrils of ochre and dun, whipping and snapping above the dunes.

Flameberge- makes it impossible to grab the blade with the hand. No flat even surface.

Animals, when a smell hits them, the react physically, they feel smell. They react like you might react to my fist coming at your face. We call it wind bumping. Scent bumping.

The phrase &quot;witching hour&quot; began at least as early as 1775, in the poem &quot;Night, an Ode.&quot; by Rev. Matthew West,[1] though its origins may go further back to 1535 where the Catholic Church prohibited activities during the 3-4 am timeframe due to emerging fears about witchcraft in Europe.[2]
In the Western Christian tradition, the hour between 3 and 4 a.m. was considered a period of peak supernatural activity – this time is also referred to as the &quot;Devil's hour&quot; due to it being a mocking inversion of the time in which Jesus supposedly died, which was at 3 pm


A few years back I was in a bad place-deepest hole I’ve ever been in. Lost my job, friends, family’s trust all to drown my pain in alcohol. I’d go on week long benders where I’d drink until I passed out, woke up with the bottle in my hand and kept going. Sometimes I wouldn’t even eat for a couple days. I was fucked. The first time I went through bad withdrawals was rough. Stayed with my parents for a couple days. Dizzy, crying, restless legs, jitters...the whole lot. But it wasn’t enough to stop the drinking. I still hated myself and wanted to just-stop existing. That was the closest I could get to it. Then the second baaaad bender and case of withdrawals. This time all the symptoms were worse and I started dissociating. I didn’t know where or who I was, I’d be fixated on an object and I couldn’t figure out why. Non-responsive. Just an empty husk. When I saw how worried my parents were I knew I needed change in my life but I was too scared to let it go and face the truths about myself; it was just much easier at the time to hide behind my secrets and medicate this way...and then the last one, which was clearly the worst.

Love is the base of all emotion. All others flow from it. Anger comes from love. Hate. Love cannot come from hate. Only with the power of sol can hate become transformed to love.

We would all like to believe that our suffering has made us special -- especially if it gives us a righteous reason to destroy our enemies. 

The answer is the distinction between theological world views and evidentiary world views. Theological world views like the modern Abrahamic faiths have only their holy books to rely on. Interpretations of these holy books change, but the core principles have to be frome the books. Then they look at science and see this theory get altered and adapted over time. Because they are seeing the world from the paradigm of their beliefs, they expect the this 'naturalistic religion' to also be imalliable. They don't understand that science changing with the evidence is a feature, not a bug, and see it as a dogma scrambling to retcon itself before its 'followers convert.'

It was April 22nd 2018. I woke up around 2am still drunk, and opened another beer crying. I hated what I had become and I was so lost. I had given up and had planned to just end it all by downing a bottle of sleeping meds. I called my mom to tell her goodbye and that I loved her, but she knew something was different (I had called like this before, just belligerent and rambling sadness while drunk). I couldn’t do it and broke down. I told her why I had actually called and she came and picked me up. This time I decided to actually get help. Checked into a facility that morning. Took a year to sober up and straighten out. There are still really hard days that I just want to disappear. But I’m just glad I’m not that man I used to be, I’m glad I decided to hold on a bit longer.
Since then, my niece was born and tonight, we’re watching movies together and cuddling. I never would have gotten to experience this if things had been different.

            <Text> In pains and in anxieties do you bear (children), woman; and toward your husband (is) your inclination, and he lords it over you. And do you not know that you are (each) an Eve? The sentence of God on this sex of yours lives in this age: the guilt must of necessity live too. You are the devil's gateway: you are the unsealer of that (forbidden) tree: you are the first deserter of the divine law: you are she who persuaded him whom the devil was not valiant enough to attack. You destroyed so easily God's image, man. On account of your desert — that is, death — even the Son of God had to die. And do you think about adorning yourself over and above your tunics of skins? Come, now; if from the beginning of the world the Milesians sheared sheep, and the Serians spun trees, and the Tyrians dyed, and the Phrygians embroidered with the needle, and the Babylonians with the loom, and pearls gleamed, and onyx-stones flashed; if gold itself also had already issued, with the cupidity (which accompanies it), from the ground; if the mirror, too, already had licence to lie so largely, Eve, expelled from paradise, (Eve) already dead, would also have coveted these things, I imagine! No more, then, ought she now to crave, or be acquainted with (if she desires to live again), what, when she was living, she had neither had nor known. Accordingly these things are all the baggage of woman in her condemned and dead state, instituted as if to swell the pomp of her funeral. 

is not only not to be desired, but even execrated, by you: first, because the study of making personal grace (which we know to be naturally the inviter of lust) a mean of pleasing does not spring from a sound conscience: why therefore excite toward yourself that evil (passion)? Why invite (that) to which you profess yourself a stranger? Secondly, because we ought not to open a way to temptations, which, by their instancy, sometimes achieve (a wickedness) which God expels from them who are His; (or,) at all events, put the spirit into a thorough tumult by (presenting) a stumbling-block (to it).

            <Title>Into Pit Cave</Title>
            <Text>The man walking in front of Mandri, the one carrying the ‘unconscious’ Mazyd Oro, his name was Hill. The man walking behind Mandri, the one with the torch, his name was Bib, and according to Bib, these were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don’t bother with ‘why’, or ‘what is going on’, or ‘I can’t see where I’m going’, no, the only thing that mattered was that Hill was in front and Bib was behind and that was the way things were going to be - and also, stop talking. Don’t make a peep. On that point Bib was especially clear. Even “breathing too loud” was sufficient cause for a whack on the back of the head.
Sound carried in that pitch-black tunnel, so the going was hard for Mandri. All the while he was stifling groans because his once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods. They were so sore that it felt like if he bent them half a nick then his thighs would rupture. Instead of striding through the dark like Bib wanted him to, he swayed through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor. This was hard to do because the tunnel was a dumping ground. Not a place for unshod feet. There were picked-clean bones of small animals, splintered balkanut shells the size of skulls, curved clay shards of shattered jars, and all manner of organic waste, the worst of which was the cold and gooey lump of something brown that welled up in between Mandri’s toes when he stepped in it.
Mandri hoped the stuff wasn’t what he thought it was. 
Best not to think about it.
Easy not to think about it, considering there was a godsdamned Mazydai right in front of him. A Mazydai, a being of storied power, yet there he was all cut-up and shoulder-slung like a sty-pig at a wet market.
Who could have managed that?
Mandri knew it couldn’t have been these two Jandri men who were ushering him through the tunnel. Hill and Bib were as typical as sandland folk come, thin and irritable. Hungry looking. The only remarkable things about them were their deficiencies; Hill was short, and Bib was an ass. Nothing special.
Mandri snuck a look behind at Bib. Bib had his pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.
Bib shouted, “Get going!”
No, these two didn’t subdue Mazyd Oro and neither did they bring Mandri back from the dead, and he had been brought back from the dead, Mandri was certain of that now. This couldn’t be the Underworld because the Underworld’s keepers should be terrifying, not dumb and annoying. Then again, now that he was having his heels clipped by Bib’s impatient toes every other step, he wasn’t sure which would be worse - an eternity of this or an eternity of torture. Having his flesh be torn from his bones would be infinitely worse, but Mandri never liked to let get in the way of a good pout.
Outside of the fact that an objective universe exists independent of his own mind, the only thing Mandri was completely sure of was that these two people had a leader, and that this leader had the strength to bring low a Mazydai and conquer even conquer death.
Whoever that person was, it was a man worth meeting. So Mandri steeled himself against the pain in his legs, rubbed his foot in the dirt to wipe the shit off it, and then did his best to keep up with Hill who was finding his way through the dark like he’d placed each shattered pot and loaf of poop himself. 
Eventually the going got smoother and the tunnel got wider and it looked less like a pigsty and more like a  . Then this dark passage emptied out into a bigger one, where the ceiling was twice Mandri’s height. At the end of this larger tunnel, some fifty meters away, the tunnel gave way to the blinding light of day. Mandri’s eyes were so accustomed to the dark that one quick glance at this spot of sunlight was enough to imprint a white circle into his retina, so that no matter where he looked, there it was, a white blot obscuring everything.
Mandri stopped in his tracks out of instinct and tried to blink out the blindness. This sudden stop caused Bib to bump into Mandri’s back, and for Bib, that was unacceptable.
“Whore’s breath, boy! You’re a pokey ole tacko, ain’t ya?!”
Bib gave Mandri a hard shove that sent Mandri sprawling right into Hill’s legs, sending them both tumbling to the ground. Mazyd Oro, who’d been content to ride Hill’s shoulder, had his unconscious ruse upset by the sudden lurch. He yelped and went tumbling along with the others, splaying his elbows out to brace his fall, careful to keep his bandages out of the dirt.
Hill waddled back to his feet and then turned towards Bib and said in the most matter-of-fact tone, “Bib, you are a got-damned idiot.”
Bib brandished the torch towards him in a state of alarm. “Hill! He’s awake! The Mazyd’s awake!”
Hill looked down and there at his feet was Mandri grimacing, clutching his wrist against his stomach as he’d jammed it against an up-jut of rock. 
Mazyd Oro wasn’t there.
Hill spun around towards the entrance, expecting to see, but no one was there.
Then he heard a thud from behind and Bib give a yelp.
When Hill spun back around he caught a glimpse of a naked, pale figure sprinting into the black depths of the cave with exceptional agility, leaping from rock to rock.
“Aw, Shit!” Hill exclaimed. “Shit! Shit! Shit!”
Hill drew a short sword that was hidden under his cloak and his took off into the darkness after Oro, shouting orders to Bib as he went. “Stay here and go get Ayram!”
Bib stood and stared in disbelief into the darkness. When his wits returned to him, he turned around and took off towards the cave exit. He got halfway when his wits fully returned to him. He sprinted back towards Mandri and ordered him to get up in a tone that was as serious as it was urgent, but Mandri did not move.
“I said, get up!”
“Piss off!” Mandri retorted through clenched teeth. 
Bib let out a little roar of frustration, then reached down and grabbed Mandri by the collar and lifted him up.
Mandri, still half-blind and stumbling, tried to shrug off Bib’s grip.
“I said piss off!”
Bib swung the torch round to Mandri’s face so close that it nearly singed his eyebrows.
“Say one more word and I’ll shove this thing down your throat.”
Mandri let himself be pulled, half blind and stumbling, out into the sun. When they got there, Bib let go and Mandri collapsed and let the warmth wash over him. The orange sand swallowing his knees was hot but comfortably so, like .  He dug his hands into it. Mandri wanted to dive into it like a horse-backed lizard.
Bib shouted, “Ayram!”
Mandri looked up and squinted at the blob of shadow out in front of him. 
After a moment of trying to parse the blob of light and shadow in front of him, Mandri realized that he wasn’t quite out of the cave yet, for the tunnel ‘exit’ was more of an entrance into the bottom of a fat cylindrical pit. All around there were walls of sheer vertical limestone rising up a good thirty feet to encircle a pit of orange sand. The sun’s light angled down the sides of this colossal white limestone bucket, leaving half the pit in cold shadow, and half in a dusty, radiant glow.
Bib was shielding his eyes, looking for someone hidden in the cool shadows of the other side of the pit. Mandri saw a few dark and lumpy shapes against the limestone and assumed they were people, but he couldn’t quite make them out.
Bib shouted for his leader.
“Ayram!”
One of the shadows spoke up and said, “He’s not here.” 
“Where in the hell is he?”
“He’s in the cloister with Elrahet.”
Bib dashed back into the darkness of the tunnel, leaving Mandri in the sun alone, spotlighted against the sand.
Mandri squinted into the shadow of the pit and was struck dumb by the glare of strangers descending upon him. 
An attractive Zosan woman stepped into the light. Her dark face and dark eyes were framed by a white linen scarf that was loosely wrapped around her head and neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige burnoose. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of life out in the Sand, the lady wore it with a hint of regal bearing - there was a kind of self-important sweep of the shoulders that showed she knew how to stand, for amongst those obsessed with refinement, even standing is an art. 
Her voice was almost as imperious as her stern brow. 
“You’re the dead boy,” she said. 
Yes, Mandri was the dead boy. It was such a simple matter of fact, but the way she said it made it seem like it was some keen insight that was obvious only to her. 
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. He was anxious not to appear to ruffled to a bandit queen - or whoever this was. He narrowed his eyes and sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it when he saw the woman smirk.
“I am Moteah,” the woman said.
Moteah wrinkled her nose as she looked down on Mandri, like she could smell the death on him. 
She shook some thought out of her head, then said, “That man who brought you out here, do you know why he was so hasty?”
Mandri smiled. “The other prisoner escaped.”
“The Mazydai?” Moteah asked.
“Yes.”
The word was hardly out of Mandri’s mouth when three scraggly men, wrapped up in , leapt up out of the shadows and sprinted across the sand. In three strides they brushed past Mandri on the fourth they disappeared into the dark tunnel, leaving cloud of dust swirling in the entrance behind them.
Moteah held her arms up before anyone else could follow.
“No one else! The Mazyd has nowhere to go. Ayram will deal with it.”
All the while her eyes were fixed on Mandri.
Mandri is like, fuck.
“On the off chance you that aren’t a living curse, I’d like to extend you the courtesy of welcome.”
The woman took a step back, bowed at the waist, and flourished her arm in Mandri’s general direction. 
A few chuckles chorused out of the pit’s shadow.
“You will have to forgive my fellow Ayramun for not receiving you with warmth,” Moteah said. “The discovery of your body heralded the worst few days that many of us can remember.”
